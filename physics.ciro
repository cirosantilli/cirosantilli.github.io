Physics is the \x[art] of predicting the future by modelling the world with \x[mathematics].

\x[ciro-santilli] doesn't know physics. He writes about it partly to start playing with some scientific content for: \x[ourbigbook-com], partly because this stuff is just amazingly beautiful.

Ciro's main intellectual \x[physics] \x[fetish]{p} are to learn \x[quantum-electrodynamics] (understanding the point of \x[lie-group]{p} being a subpart of that) and \x[condensed-matter-physics].

Every science \x[reductionism][is Physics in disguise], but the number of objects in the real world is so large that we can't solve the real equations in practice.

Luckily, due to \x[emergence], we can use uglier higher level approximations of the world to solve many problems, with the complex limits of applicability of those approximations.

Therefore, such higher level approximations are highly specialized, and given different names such as:
* \x[chemistry]
* \x[biology]

As of 2019, all known physics can be described by two theories:
* the \x[standard-model]
* \x[general-relativity]

Unifying those two into the \x[theory-of-everything] one of the major goals of modern physics.

= How to teach and learn physics
{parent=physics}
{tag=essays-by-ciro-santilli}

The approach many courses take to physics, specially "modern Physics" is really bad, this is how it should be taught:
* start by describing experiments that the previous best theory did not explain. This gets intimately entangled with basically learning the \x[history-of-physics], which is extremely beneficial as also highlighted by \x[ron-maimon], and also because \x[there-is-value-in-tutorials-written-by-early-pioneers-of-the-field].

  In the \x[surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman-chapter-o-americano-outra-vez] \x[richard-feynman] describes his experience teaching in \x[brazil] in the early 1950s, and how everything was memorized, without any explanation of the experiments or that the theory has some relationship to the real world! Although things have improved considerably since, Ciro still feels that some areas of physics are still taught without enough experiments described upfront. Notably, ironically, \x[quantum-field-theory], which is where Feynman himself worked. Feynman gave huge importance to understanding and explaining experiments, as can also be seen on \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].
* then, give the final formula for the next best theory
* then, give all the important final implications of that formula, and how it amazingly describes the experiments. In particular this means: \x[doing-physics-means-calculating-a-number]
* then, give some mathematical intuition on the formulas, and how the main equation could have been derived
* finally, then and only then, start deriving the outcomes of the main formula in detail

This is likely because at some point, experiments get more and more complicated, and so people are tempted to say "this is the truth" instead of "this is why we think this is the truth", which is much harder.

But we can't be lazy, there is no replacement to the why.

= Doing physics means calculating a number
{parent=how-to-teach-and-learn-physics}

In Physics, in order to test a theory, you must be able to extract a number from it.

It does not matter how, if it is exact, or numerical, or a message from \x[god]: a number has to come out of the formulas in the end, and you have to compare it with the experimental data.

Many theoretical physicists seem to forget this in their lectures, see also: \x[how-to-teach-and-learn-physics]{full}.

{parent=the-most-important-physics-experiments}
{title2=1923}
{wiki}

Classic theory predicts that the output frequency must be the same as the input one since the electromagnetic wave makes the electron vibrate with same frequency as itself, which then irradiates further waves.

But the output waves are longer because \x[planck-einstein-relation][photons are discrete and energy is proportional to frequency]:

The formula is exactly that of two \x[relativistic] billiard balls colliding.

Therefore this is evidence that \x[photon]{p} exist and have momentum.

No matter how hight the wave intensity, if it the frequency is small, no photons are removed from the material.

{title2=1947}

Published as Fine Structure of the Hydrogen Atom by a Microwave Method by \x[willis-lamb] and Robert Retherford (1947) on \x[physical-review].

\x[microwave] technology was developed in \x[world-war-ii] for \x[radar], notably at the \x[mit-radiation-laboratory]. Before that, people were using much higher frequencies such as the \x[visible-spectrum]. But to detect small energy differences, you need to look into longer wavelengths.

This experiment was fundamental to the development of \x[quantum-electrodynamics]. As mentioned at \x[genius-richard-feynman-and-modern-physics-by-james-gleick-1994] chapter "Shrinking the infinities", before the experiment, people already knew that trying to add \x[electromagnetism] to the \x[dirac-equation] led to \x[infinities-in-quantum-field-theory][infinities] using previous methods, and something needed to change urgently. However for the first time now the theorists had one precise number to try and hack their formulas to reach, not just a philosophical debate about infinities, and this led to major breakthroughs. The same book also describes the experiment briefly as:
\Q[Willis Lamb had just shined a beam of microwaves onto a hot wisp of hydrogen blowing from an oven.]

This one has open accesses as of 2021: https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.72.241

It is two pages and a half long.

They were at \x[columbia-university] in the \x[columbia-radiation-laboratory]. Robert was Willis' graduate student.

Previous less experiments had already hinted at this effect, but they were too imprecise to be sure.

The current state of Physics has been the result of several previous unifications as shown at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything#Conventional_sequence_of_theories so it is expected that this last missing unification is likely to happen one day, potentially conditional on humanity having enough energy to observe new phenomena.

= Defining properties of elementary particles
{parent=elementary-particle}

A suggested at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 3.9 "Elementary particles", it appears that in the \x[standard-model], the behaviour of each particle can be uniquely defined by the following five numbers:
* due to \x[spacetime-symmetry]{p}:
  * \x[mass]
  * \x[spin-physics]
* due to \x[internal-symmetry]{p}:
  * \x[electric-charge]
  * \x[weak-charge]
  * \x[color-charge]

E.g. for the \x[electron] we have:
* mass: $9.1 \times 10^{-31}$
* spin: 1/2
* electric charge: $1.6 \times 10^{-29}$
* weak charge: -1/2
* color charge: 0

Once you specify these properties, you could in theory just pluck them into the \x[standard-model-lagrangian] and you could simulate what happens. 

Setting new random values for those properties would also allow us to create new particles. It appears unknown why we only see the particles that we do, and \x[parameters-of-the-standard-model][why they have the values of properties they have].

= Photon
{parent=elementary-particle}
{wiki}

Initially light was though of as a wave because it experienced interference as shown by experiments such as:
* \x[double-slit-experiment]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_rings

But then, some key experiments also start suggesting that \x[light] is made up of \x[discrete] packets:
* \x[compton-scattering], also suggests that photons carry momentum
* \x[photoelectric-effect]
* \x[single-photon-production-and-detection-experiments]
and in the understanding of the 2020 \x[standard-model] the photon is one of the \x[elementary-particle]{p}{parent}.

This duality is fully described mathematically by \x[quantum-electrodynamics]{parent}, where the photon is modelled as a quantized excitation of the photon field.

{wiki}

In \x[special-relativity], it is impossible to travel faster than light.

One argument of why, is that if you could travel faster than light, then you could send a message to a point in \x[spacetime] that is \x[spacelike-separated] from the present. But then since the target is spacelike separated, there exists a \x[inertial-frame-of-reference] in which that event happens before the present, which would be hard to make sense of.

Even worse, it would be possible to travel back in time:

One interesting thing he mentions is that you could get single photons by making your sunglasses thicker and thicker to reduce how many photons pass, but one big downside problem is that then you don't know when the photon is going to come through, that becomes essentially random, and then you can't use this technique if you need two photons at the same time, which is often the case, see also: \x[two-photon-interference-experiment].

{parent=optics}

The most important type of lens is the \x[biconvex-spherical-lens].

= Biconvex spherical lens
{parent=lens}

Focal length

Each side is a sphere section. They don't have to have the same radius, they are still simple to understand with different radiuses.

The two things you have to have in mind that this does are:
* converges \x[parallel-light] to a point at center at distance $f$ known as the \x[focal-length].

  This is for example why you can use lenses to burn things with \x[sun] rays, which are basically parallel.

  Conversely, if the input is a \x[point-light-source] at the \x[focal-length], it gets converted into \x[parallel-light].
* image formation: it converges all rays coming from a given source point to a single point image. This amplifies the signal, and forms an image at a plane.

  The source image can be far away, and the virtual image can be close to the lens. This is exactly what we need for a camera.

  For each distance on one side, it only works for another distance on the other side. So when we set the distance between the lens and the detector, this sets the distance of the source object, i.e. the focus. The equation is:
  $$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_1} + \frac{1}{S_2}$$
  where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the two distances.

The polarization state and how it can be decomposed into different modes can be well visualized with the \x[poincare-sphere].

One key idea about photon polarization is that it carries \x[angular-momentum]. Therefore, when an electron changes orbitals in the \x[schrodinger-equation-solution-for-the-hydrogen-atom], the angular momentum (as well as energy) change is carried out by the polarization of the \x[photon]!

Particularly cool is to see how \x[fresnel] fully understood that light is somehow polarized, even though he did not know \x[electromagnetic-theory-of-light][that it was made out of electromagnetism], clear indication of which only came with the \x[faraday-effect] in 1845.

https://spie.org/publications/fg05_p03_maluss_law[]:
\Q[At the beginning of the nineteenth century the only known way to generate polarized light was with a calcite crystal. In 1808, using a calcite crystal, Malus discovered that natural incident light became polarized when it was reflected by a glass surface, and that the light reflected close to an angle of incidence of 57° could be extinguished when viewed through the crystal. He then proposed that natural light consisted of the s- and p-polarizations, which were perpendicular to each other.]

Given the view of the \x[standard-model] where the \x[electron] and \x[quark]{p} are just completely separate matter fields, there is at first sight no clear theoretical requirement for that.

As mentioned e.g. at \x[qed-and-the-men-who-made-it-dyson-feynman-schwinger-and-tomonaga-by-silvan-schweber-1994] chapter 1.6 "Hole theory", \x[dirac] initially wanted to think of the holes in his hole theory as the \x[proton]{p}, as a way to not have to postulate a new particle, the \x[positron], and as a way to "explain" the proton in similar terms.

\x[physicist]{c}{p} love to talk about that stuff, but no one ever has the guts to explain it into enough detail to show its beauty!!!

Perhaps the wisest thing is to just focus entirely on the \x[u-1] part to start with, which is the \x[quantum-electrodynamics] one, which is the simplest and most useful and historically first one to come around.

Perhaps the best explanation is that if you assume those \x[internal-symmetry]{p}, then you can systematically make "obvious" educated guesses at the interacting part of the \x[standard-model-lagrangian], which is the fundamental part of the \x[standard-model]. See e.g.:
* \x[derivation-of-the-quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian]

A local symmetry transformation is much more complicated to visualize. Take a rectangular grid of the billiard balls from the last post, say ten times ten. Each ball is spherical symmetric, and thus invariant under a rotation. The system now has a global and a local symmetry. A global symmetry transformation would rotate each ball by the same amount in the same direction, leaving the system unchanged. A local symmetry transformation would rotate each ball about a different amount and around a different axis, still leaving the system to the eye unchanged. The system has also an additional global symmetry. Moving the whole grid to the left or to the right leaves the grid unchanged. However, no such local symmetry exists: Moving only one ball will destroy the grid's structure.

Such global and local symmetries play an important role in physics. The global symmetries are found to be associated with properties of particles, e. g., whether they are matter or antimatter, whether they carry electric charge, and so on. Local symmetries are found to be associated with forces. In fact, all the fundamental forces of nature are associated with very special local symmetries. For example, the weak force is actually associated in a very intricate way with local rotations of a four-dimensional sphere. The reason is that, invisible to the eye, everything charged under the weak force can be characterized by a arrow pointing from the center to the surface of such a four-dimensional sphere. This arrow can be rotated in a certain way and at every individual point, without changing anything which can be measured. It is thus a local symmetry. This will become more clearer over time, as at the moment of first encounter this appears to be very strange indeed.

Unified all previous electro-magnetism theories into one equation.

Explains the propagation of light as a wave, and matches the previously known relationship between the \x[speed-of-light] and electromagnetic constants.

The equations are a limit case of the more complete \x[quantum-electrodynamics], and unlike that more general theory account for the quantization of \x[photon].

The equations are a system of \x[partial-differential-equation].

The system consists of 6 unknown functions that map 4 variables: time t and the x, y and z positions in space, to a real number:
* $E_x(t, x,y,z)$, $E_y(t, x,y,z)$, $E_z(t, x,y,z)$: directions of the electric field $\E : \R^4 \to \R^3$
* $B_x(t, x,y,z)$, $B_y(t, x,y,z)$, $B_z(t, x,y,z)$: directions of the magnetic field $\B : \R^4 \to \R^3$
and two known input functions:
* $\rho : \R^3\ to \R$: density of charges in space
* $\J : \R^3 \to \R^3$: current vector in space. This represents the strength of moving charges in space.

Due to the \x[conservation-of-charge] however, those input functions have the following restriction:
$$
\pdv{\rho}{t} + \div{\mathbf{\J}} = 0
$$
{title=Charge conservation}

Also consider the following cases:
* if a spherical charge is moving, then this of course means that $\rho$ is changing with time, and at the same time that a current exists
* in an \x[ideal] infinite cylindrical wire however, we can have constant $\rho$ in the wire, but there can still be a current because those charges are moving

  Such infinite cylindrical wire is of course an ideal case, but one which is a good approximation to the huge number of electrons that travel in a actual wire.

The goal of finding $\E$ and $\B$ is that those fields allow us to determine the force that gets applied to a charge via the \x[equation-lorentz-force], and then to find the force we just need to integrate over the entire body.

Finally, now that we have defined all terms involved in the Maxwell equations, let's see the equations:

$$
div{\E} = \frac{\rho}{\vacuumPermittivity}
$$
{title=Gauss' law}

$$
div{\B} = 0
$$

$$

$$

= Explicit scalar form of the Maxwell's equations

For numerical algorithms and to get a more low level understanding of the equations, we can expand all terms to the simpler and more explicit form:
$$
\pdv{E_x}{x} + \pdv{E_y}{x} +
\pdv{E_z}{x} =
\frac{\rho}{\vacuumPermittivity}
\\

\pdv{B_x}{x} +
\pdv{B_y}{x} +
\pdv{B_z}{x} =
0
\\

\pdv{E_z}{y} - \pdv{E_y}{z} = -\pdv{B_x}{t} \\
\pdv{E_x}{z} - \pdv{E_z}{x} = -\pdv{B_y}{t} \\
\pdv{E_y}{x} - \pdv{E_x}{y} = -\pdv{B_z}{t} \\

\pdv{B_z}{y} - \pdv{B_y}{z} = \vacuumPermeability \left(J_x + \vacuumPermittivity \pdv{E_x}{t} \right) \\
\pdv{B_x}{z} - \pdv{B_z}{x} = \vacuumPermeability \left(J_y + \vacuumPermittivity \pdv{E_y}{t} \right) \\
\pdv{B_y}{x} - \pdv{B_x}{y} = \vacuumPermeability \left(J_z + \vacuumPermittivity \pdv{E_z}{t} \right) \\

= Overdetermination of Maxwell's equations
{parent=explicit-scalar-form-of-the-maxwell-s-equations}
{wiki=Maxwell's_equations#Overdetermination_of_Maxwell's_equations}

As seen from \x[explicit-scalar-form-of-the-maxwell-s-equations], this expands to 8 equations, so the question arises if the system is over-determined because it only has 6 functions to be determined.

As explained on the Wikipedia page  however, this is not the case, because if the first two equations hold for the initial condition, then the othe six equations imply that they also hold for all time, so they can be essentially omitted.

It is also worth noting that the first two equations don't involve time derivatives. Therefore, they can be seen as spacial constraints.

TODO: the \x[electric-field] and \x[magnetic-field] can be expressed in terms of the \x[electric-potential] and \x[magnetic-vector-potential]. So then we only need 4 variables?

Explains how it is possible \x[invariance-of-the-speed-of-light][that everyone observes the same speed of light, even if they are moving towards or opposite to the light]!!!

This was first best observed by the \x[michelson-morley-experiment], which uses the movement of the Earth at different times of the year to try and detect differences in the speed of light.

This leads leads to the following conclusions:
* to \x[length-contraction] and time dilation
* the speed of light is the maximum speed anything can reach

All of this goes of course completely against our daily Physics intuition.

The "special" in the name refers to the fact that it is a superset of \x[general-relativity], which also explains gravity in a single framework.

Since time and space get all messed up together, you have to be very careful to understand what it means to say "I observed this to happen over there at that time", otherwise you will go crazy. A good way to think about is this:
* use \x[einstein-synchronization] to setup a bunch of clocks for every position in your \x[frame-of-reference]
* on every point of space, you put a little detector which records events and the time of the event
* each detector can only detect events locally, i.e. events that happen very close to the detector
* then, after the event, the detectors can send a signal to you, who is sitting at the origin, telling you what they detected

The equation that allows us to calculate stuff in \x[special-relativity]!

Take two observers with identical rules and stopwatch, and aligned axes, but one is on a car moving at towards the $+x$ direction at speed $v$.

TODO image.

When both observe an event, if we denote:
* $(t, x, y, z)$ the observation of the standing observer
* $(t', x', y', z')$ the observation of the ending observer on a car
It is of course arbitrary who is standing and who is moving, we will just use the term "standing" for the one without primes.

Then the coordinates of the event observed by the observer on the car are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t' & = \gamma \left( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right) \\
x' & = \gamma \left( x - v t \right) \\
y' & = y \\
z' & = z
\end{aligned}
$$
where:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}
$$

Note that if $\frac{v}{c}$ tends towards zero, then this reduces to the usual \x[galilean-transformation]{p} which our intuition expects:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t' & = t
x' & = x - v t \\
y' & = y \\
z' & = z
\end{aligned}
$$

This explains why we don't observe special relativity in our daily lives: macroscopic objects move too slowly compared to light, and $\frac{v}{c}$ is almost zero.

Basically a synonym of \x[lorentz-covariance]?

= Lorentz transform consequence: everyone sees the same speed of light
{c}
{parent=lorentz-transformation}

OK, so let's verify the main desired consequence of the \x[lorentz-transformation]: that everyone observes the same \x[speed-of-light].

Observers will measure the speed of light by calculating how long it takes the light going towards $+x$ cross a rod of length $L = x_2 - x_1$ laid in the x axis at position $X1$.

TODO image.

Each observer will observe two events:
* $(t_1, x_1, y_1, z_1)$: the light touches the left side of the rod
* $(t_2, x_2, y_2, z_2)$: the light touches the right side of the rod

Supposing that the standing observer measures the speed of light as $c$ and that light hits the left side of the rod at time $T1$, then he observes the coordinates:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t_1 & = T1 \\
x_1 & = X1 \\
t_2 & = \frac{L}{c} \\
x_2 & = X1 + L \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, if we transform for the moving observer:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t_1' & = \gamma \left( t_1 - \frac{v x_1}{c^2} \right) \\
x_1' & = \gamma \left( x_1 - v t_1             \right) \\
t_2' & = \gamma \left( t_2 - \frac{v x_2}{c^2} \right) \\
x_2' & = \gamma \left( x_2 - v t_2             \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
and so the moving observer measures the speed of light as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
c' & = \frac{x_2' - x_1'}{t_2' - t_1'} \\
   & = \frac{(x_2 - v t_2) - (x_1 - v t_1)}{(t_2 - \frac{v x_2}{c^2}) - (t_1 - \frac{v x_1}{c^2})} \\
   & = \frac{(x_2 - x_1) - v (t_2 - t_1)}{(t_2 - t_1) - \frac{v}{c^2} (x_2 - x_1)} \\
   & = \frac{\frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1} - v}{1 - \frac{v}{c^2} \frac{x_2 -x_1}{t_2 - t_1}} \\
   & = \frac{c - v}{1 - \frac{v}{c^2} c} \\
   & = \frac{c - v}{\frac{c - v}{c}} \\
   & = c \\
\end{aligned}
$$

= Length contraction
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

Suppose that a rod has is length $L$ measured on a rest frame $S$ (or maybe even better: two identical rulers were manufactured, and one is taken on a spaceship, a bit like the \x[twin-paradox]).

Question: what is the length $L'$ than an observer in frame $S'$ moving relative to $S$ as speed $v$ observe the rod to be?

The key idea is that there are two events to consider in each frame, which we call 1 and 2:
* the left end of the rod is an observation event at a given position at a given time: $x_1$ and $t_1$ for $S$ or $x'_1$ and $t'_1$ for $S'$
* the right end of the rod is an observation event at a given position at a given time : $x_2$ and $t_2$ for $S$ or $x'_2$ and $t'_2$ for $S'$
Note that what you visually observe on a photograph is a different measurement to the more precise/easy to calculate two event measurement. On a photograph, it seems you might not even see the contraction in some cases as mentioned at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotation

Measuring a length means to measure the $x_2 - x_1$ difference for a single point in time in your frame ($t2 = t1$).

So what we want to obtain is $x'_2 - x'_1$ for any given time $t'2 = t'1$.

In summary, we have:
$$
\begin{aligned}
L  &= x_2  &- x_1 \\
L' &= x'_2 &- x'_1
t'_2 = t'_1
\end{aligned}
$$

By plugging those values into the \x[lorentz-transformation], we can eliminate $t_2 and t_1$, and conclude that for any $t'_2 = t'_1$, the length contraction relation holds:
$$
L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}
$$

The key question that needs intuitive clarification then is: but how can this be symmetric? How can both observers see each other's rulers shrink?

And the key answer is: because to the second observer, the measurements made by the first observer are not simultaneous. Notably, the two measurement events are obviously \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p} by looking at the \x[light-cone], and therefore can be measured even in different orders by different observers.

One of the best ways to think about it is the \x[transversal-time-dilation] thought experiment.

{parent=time-dilation}
{wiki=Time_dilation#Simple_inference_of_velocity_time_dilation}

Light watch transverse to direction of motion. This case is interesting because it separates \x[length-contraction] from \x[time-dilation] completely.

Of course, as usual in \x[special-relativity], calling something "time dilation" leads us to \x[mind-boggling] ideas of "symmetry breaking": if both frames have a light watch, how can both possibly observe the other to be time dilated?

And the answer to this, is the usual: in special relativity time and space are interwoven in a \x[fucked] up way, everything is just a spacetime event.

In this case, there are three spacetime events of interest: both clocks start at same position, your beam hits up at x=0, moving frame hits up at x>0.

Those two mentioned events are \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p}, and therefore even though they seem simultaneous to you, they are not going to be simultaneous to the moving observer!

If \x[einstein-synchronization][little clock one meter away from you] tells you that at the time of some event (your light beam hit up) the moving light watch was only 50% up, this is just a number given by your one meter away watch!

= Twin paradox
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

The key question is: why is this not symmetrical?

One answer is: because one of the twin accelerates, and therefore changes inertial frames.

But the better answer is: understand what happens when the stationary twin sends light signals at constant time intervals to each other. When does the travelling twin receives them?

By doing that, we see that "all the extra aging happens immediately when the twin turns around":
* on the out trip, both twins receive signals at constant intervals
* when the moving twin turns around and starts to accelerate through different inertial frames, shit happens:
  * the moving twin suddenly notices that the rate of signals from the stationary twin increased. They are getting older faster than us!
  * the stationary twin suddenly notices that the rate of signals from the moving twin decreased. They are getting older slower than us!
* then when the moving twin reaches the return velocity, both see constant signal rates once again

{title=Twin paradox illustration with twins sending light signals at regular intervals.}

Another way of understanding it is: you have to make all calculations on a \i[single] inertial frame for the entire trip.

Supposing the sibling quickly accelerates out (or magically starts moving at constant speed), travels at constant speed, and quickly accelerates back, and travels at constant speed setup, there are three frames that seem reasonable:
* the frame of the non-accelerating sibling
* the outgoing trip of the accelerating sibling
* the return trip of the accelerating sibling

If you do that, all three calculations give the exact same result, which is reassuring.

Another way to understand it is to do explicit integrations of the acceleration: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/242043/what-is-the-proper-way-to-explain-the-twin-paradox/242044#242044 This is the least insightful however :-)

The following aspects of \x[maxwell-s-equations] make no sense without \x[special-relativity]:
* the \x[lorentz-force] would be different observers have different speeds, see e.g.: \x[charged-particle-moving-at-the-same-speed-of-electrons-thought-experiment]
* \x[maxwell-s-equations-imply-that-the-speed-of-light-is-the-same-for-all-inertial-reference-frames]

When charged particle though experiment are seen from the point of view of special relativity, it becomes clear that magnetism is just a direct side effect of charges being viewed in special relativity. One is philosophically reminded of how \x[the-dirac-equation-predicts-spin][spin is the consequence of quantum mechanics + special relativity].

= Charged particle moving at the same speed of electrons thought experiment
{synonym}
{title2}

This is a well known though experiment, which \x[richard-feynman] used to emphasize
* infinite wire with balanced positive and negative charges, so no net charge, but a net magnetic field
* a single charge moves parallel to wire at the same speed as the electrons

In the above experiment:
* from the wire frame, the charge feels electromagnetic force, because it is moving and there is a magnetic field
* from the single charge frame, there is still magnetic field (positive charges are moving), but the body itself is not moving, so there is no force!

The solution to this problem is \x[length-contraction]: the positive charges are length contracted and the moving electrons aren't, and therefore they are denser and therefore there is an effective charge from that frame.

And at that same time \x[poincare] also immediately started to think about the other \x[fundamental-force] then known: \x[gravity], and off the bat realized that \x[gravitational-wave]{p} must exist. \x[general-relativity]{p} is probably just "the simplest way to make gravity \x[lorentz-covariant]".

 0 & -1 &  0 &  0 \\
 0 &  0 & -1 &  0 \\

Why should I care when I can calculate new x and new time with \x[lorentz-transformation]?

Answer: it can give some qualitative intuition on what is larger/smaller happens before/after based only on arguably more intuitive geometric considerations, without requiring you to do any calculations, see e.g. \x[image-spacetime-diagram-illustrating-how-faster-than-light-travel-implies-time-travel].

= Light cone
{parent=spacetime-diagram}
{wiki}

A subset of \x[spacetime-diagram].

The key insights that it gives are:
* future and past are well defined: every reference frame sees your future in your future cone, and your past in your past cone

  Otherwise causality could be violated, and then things would go really bad, you could tell your past self to tell your past self to tell your past self to do something.

  You can only affect the outcome of events in your future cone, and you can only be affected by events in your past cone. You can't travel fast enough to affect.

  Two spacetime events with such fixed causality are called \x[timelike-separated-event]{p}.
* every other event (to right and left, known as \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p}) can be measured to happen before or after your current spacetime event by different observers.

  But that does not violate causality, because you just can't reach those spacetime points anyways to affect them.

However, in \x[special-relativity], neither of those are invariant separately, since space and time are mixed up together.

Instead, there is a new unified invariant: the spacetime-interval, given by:
$$c \Delta t^2 - (\Delta x ^2 + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2)$$

Note that this distance can be zero for two events separated.

Quantum mechanics is quite a broad term. Perhaps it is best to start approaching it from the division into:

* \x[relativistic-quantum-mechanics]: more advanced, and arguably "less useful"

Mathematics: there are a few models of increasing precision which could all be called "quantum mechanics":

* \x[dirac-equation]

\x[ciro-santilli] feels that the \x[deep-tech][largest technological revolutions since the 1950's have been quantum related], and will continue to be for a while, from deeper understanding of chemistry and materials to \x[quantum-computing], understanding and controlling quantum systems is where the most interesting frontier of technology lies.

Searching for "H" for \x[hydrogen] leads to: https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ASD/lines1.pl?spectra=H&limits_type=0&low_w=&upp_w=&unit=1&submit=Retrieve+Data&de=0&format=0&line_out=0&en_unit=0&output=0&bibrefs=1&page_size=15&show_obs_wl=1&show_calc_wl=1&unc_out=1&order_out=0&max_low_enrg=&show_av=2&max_upp_enrg=&tsb_value=0&min_str=&A_out=0&intens_out=on&max_str=&allowed_out=1&forbid_out=1&min_accur=&min_intens=&conf_out=on&term_out=on&enrg_out=on&J_out=on

From there we can see for example the 1 to 2 lines:
* 1s to 2p: 121.5673644608 nm
* 1s to 2: 121.56701 nm TODO what does that $2$ mean?
* 1s to 2s: 121.5673123130200 TODO what does that mean?

We see that the table is sorted from lower from level first and then by upper level second.

So it is good to see that we are in the same 121nm ballpark as mentioned at \x[hydrogen-spectral-line].

The discovery of the \x[photon] was one of the major initiators of quantum mechanics.

Light was very well known to be a wave through \x[diffraction] experiments. So how could it also be a particle???

This was a key development for people to eventually notice that the \x[electron] is also a wave.

This process "started" in 1900 with \x[planck-s-law] which was based on discrete energy packets being exchanged as exposed at \x[on-the-theory-of-the-energy-distribution-law-of-the-normal-spectrum-by-max-planck-1900].

This ideas was reinforced by \x[einstein]'s explanation of the \x[photoelectric-effect] in 1905 in terms of \x[photon].

In the next big development was the \x[bohr-model] in 1913, which supposed non-\x[classical-physics] new quantization rules for the \x[electron] which explained the \x[hydrogen-emission-spectrum]. The quantization rule used made use of the \x[planck-constant], and so served an initial link between the emerging quantized nature of \x[light], and that of the \x[electron].

The final phase started in 1923, when \x[louis-de-broglie] proposed that in analogy to photons, \x[electron]{p} might also be waves, a statement made more precise through the \x[de-broglie-relations].

This event opened the floodgates, and soon \x[matrix-mechanics] was published in \x[quantum-mechanical-re-interpretation-of-kinematic-and-mechanical-relations-by-heisenberg-1925], as the first coherent formulation of \x[quantum-mechanics].

It was followed by the \x[schrodinger-equation] in 1926, which proposed an equivalent \x[partial-differential-equation] formulation to \x[matrix-mechanics], a mathematical formulation that was more familiar to \x[physicist]{p} than the matrix ideas of Heisenberg.

= Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

These are the key mathematical ideas to understand!!

There are actually a few formulations out there. By far the dominant one as of 2020 has been the \x[schrodinger-picture], which contrasts notably with the \x[heisenberg-picture].

Another well known one is the \x[de-broglie-bohm-theory], which is deterministic, but \x[non-local].

= Schrödinger picture
{c}
{parent=mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics}

The state of a quantum system is a vector of unit length in a \x[hilbert-space]. TODO why Hilbert Space.

"Making a measurement" for an \x[observable] means applying a \x[self-adjoint-operator] to the state, and after a measurement is done:
* the state collapses to an \x[eigenvector] of the self adjoint operator
* the result of the measurement is the \x[eigenvalue] of the self adjoint operator
* the probability of a given result happening when the spectrum is \x[discrete] is proportional to the modulus of the projection on that eigenvector.

  For continuous spectra such as that of the \x[position-operator] in most systems, e.g. \x[schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle], the projection on each individual eigenvalue is zero, i.e. the probability of one absolutely exact position is zero. To get a non-zero result, measurement has to be done on a continuous range of eigenvectors (e.g. for position: "is the particle present between x=0 and x=1?"), and you have to integrate the probability over the projection on a continuous range of eigenvalues.

  In such continuous cases, the probability collapses to an uniform distribution on the range after measurement.

  The continuous position operator case is well illustrated at: \x[video-visualization-of-quantum-physics-quantum-mechanics-by-udiprod-2017]
Those last two rules are also known as the \x[born-rule].

Self adjoint operators are chosen because they have the following key properties:
* their eigenvalues form an orthonormal basis
* they are diagonalizable

See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics

Perhaps the easiest case to understand this for is that of \x[spin-physics], which has only a finite number of eigenvalues. Although it is a shame that fully understanding that requires a \x[special-relativity][relativistic] quantum theory such as the \x[dirac-equation].

The next steps are to look at simple 1D bound states such as \x[particle-in-a-box] and \x[quantum-harmonic-oscillator].

This naturally generalizes to \x[schrodinger-equation-solution-for-the-hydrogen-atom].

The solution to the \x[schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle] is a bit harder since the possible energies do not make up a \x[countable-set].

This formulation was apparently called more precisely \x[dirac-von-neumann-axioms], but it because so dominant we just call it "the" formulation.

\x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-notes-by-david-tong-2007] mentions that:
\Q[if you were to write the wavefunction in quantum field theory, it would be a functional, that is a function of every possible configuration of the field $\phi$.]

= Bra-ket notation
{parent=mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics}
{wiki=Bra–ket_notation}

= Bra-ket
{synonym}

Notation used in \x[quantum-mechanics].

Ket is just a \x[vector-mathematics]. Though generally in the context of \x[quantum-mechanics], this is an infinite dimensional vector in a \x[hilbert-space] like \x[l2].

Bra is just the \x[dual-vector] corresponding to a ket, or in other words \x[projection-mathematics] \x[linear-operator], i.e. a linear function which can act on a given vector and returns a single \x[complex-number]. Also known as... \x[dot-product].

For example:
$$
(\bra{x}) \ket{y}
$$
is basically a fancy way of saying:
$$
x \cdot y
$$
that is: we are taking the projection of $y$ along the $x$ direction. Note that in the ordinary dot product notation however, we don't differentiate as clearly what is a vector and what is an operator, while the bra-ket notation makes it clear.

The projection operator is completely specified by the vector that we are projecting it on. This is why the bracket notation makes sense.

It also has the merit of clearly differentiating vectors from operators. E.g. it is not very clear in $x \cdot y$ that $x$ is an operator and $y$ is a vector, except due to the relative position to the dot. This is especially bad when we start manipulating operators by themselves without vectors.

This notation is widely used in \x[quantum-mechanics] because calculating the \x[probability] of getting a certain outcome for an experiment is calculated by taking the projection of a state on one an \x[eigenvalue] basis vector as explained at: \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics]{full}.

Making the projection operator "look like a thing" (the bra) is nice because we can add and multiply them much like we can for vectors (they also form a \x[vector-space]), e.g.:
$$
\bra{x} + \bra{y}
$$
just means taking the projection along the $x + y$ direction.

\x[ciro-santilli] thinks that this notation is a bit over-engineered. Notably the bra's are just vectors, which we should just write as usual with $\va{v}$... the bra thing makes it look scarier than it needs to be. And then we should just find a different notation for the projection part.

Maybe \x[dirac] chose it because of the appeal of the women's piece of clothing: \x[bra], in an irresistible call from \x[british-humour].

But in any case, alas, we are now stuck with it.

{c}
{parent=non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

The \x[partial-differential-equation] of \x[special-relativity][non-relativistic] \x[quantum-mechanics].

Experiments explained:
* via the \x[schrodinger-equation-solution-for-the-hydrogen-atom] it predicts:
  * \x[spectral-line] basic lines, plus \x[zeeman-effect]
* \x[schrodinger-equation-solution-for-the-helium-atom]: perturbative solutions give good approximations to the energy levels
* \x[double-slit-experiment]: I think we have a closed solution for the max and min probabilities on the measurement wall, and they match experiments

Experiments not explained: those that the \x[dirac-equation] explains like:
* \x[fine-structure]
* \x[spontaneous-emission] coefficients

To get some intuition on the equation on the consequences of the equation, have a look at:
* \x[schrodinger-equation-simulations]
* \x[solutions-of-the-schrodinger-equation]

The easiest to understand case of the equation which you must have in mind initially that of the \x[schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle].

Then, with that in mind, the general form of the \x[schrodinger-equation] is:
$$i\hbar\pdv{\psi(\vv{x}, t)}{t} = \hat{H}[\psi(\vv{x}, t)]$$
{title=Schrodinger equation}
where:
* $\hbar$ is the \x[reduced-planck-constant]
* $\psi$ is the \x[wave-function]
* $t$ is the time
* $\hat{H}$ is a \x[linear-operator] called the \x[hamiltonian]. It takes as input a function $\psi$, and returns another function. This plays a role analogous to the Hamiltonian in \x[classical-mechanics]: determining it determines what the physical system looks like, and how the system evolves in time, because we can just plug it into the equation and solve it. It basically encodes the total energy and forces of the system.

The $\vv{x}$ argument of $\psi$ could be anything, e.g.:
* we could have preferred \x[polar-coordinate]{p} instead of linear ones if the potential were symmetric around a point
* we could have more than one particle, e.g. \x[solutions-of-the-schrodinger-equation-for-two-electrons], which would have e.g. $x_1$ and $x_2$ for different particles. No matter how many particles there are, we have just a single $\psi$, we just add more arguments to it.
* we could have even more generalized coordinates. This is much in the spirit of \x[hamiltonian-mechanics] or \x[generalized-coordinate]{p}
Note however that there is always a single magical $t$ time variable. This is needed in particular because there is a time \x[partial-derivative] in the equation, so there must be a corresponding time variable in the function. This makes the equation explicitly \x[non-relativistic].

The general \x[schrodinger-equation] can be broken up into a trivial time-dependent and a \x[time-independent-schrodinger-equation] by separation of variables. So in practice, all we need to solve is the slightly simpler \x[time-independent-schrodinger-equation], and the full equation comes out as a result.

Existence and uniqueness: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/212913/existence-and-uniqueness-for-two-dimensional-time-dependent-schr%C3%B6dinger-equation

= Time-independent Schrodinger equation
{parent=schrodinger-equation}
{wiki=Schrödinger_equation#Time-independent_equation}

As shown at https://quantummechanics.ucsd.edu/ph130a/130_notes/node124.html[] from \x[quantum-physics-by-jim-branson-2003], using \x[separation-of-variables] we can break up the general \x[schrodinger-equation] into:
* a time-only part that does not depend on space and does not depend on the potential
* a space-only part that does not depend on time:

  $$\hat{H}[\psi(\vv{x})] = E \psi{\vv{x}}$$
  {title=Time-independent Schrodinger equation}

  Since this is the only non-trivial part, unlike the time part which is trivial, this spacial part is just called "the time-independent Schrodinger equation".

  Note that the $\psi$ here is not the same as the $\psi$ in the \x[equation-schrodinger-equation][time-dependent Schrodinger equation] of course, as that psi is the result of the multiplication of the time and space parts. This is a bit of imprecise terminology, but hey, physics.

The key initial example to have in mind is the \x[time-independent-schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle].

It is interesting to note that the time-independent Schrodinger equation can also be seen exactly as an \x[eigenvalue] equation, since the value of the energy `E` can be any fixed value that can satisfy the \x[boundary-condition]{p} conditions imposed. The only difference from usual \x[matrix] \x[eigenvector]{p} is that we are now dealing with an \x[infinite-dimensional] vector space.

Then, just like in \x[solving-partial-differential-equations-with-the-fourier-series] of the \x[heat-equation], the boundary conditions may make it so that only certain \x[discrete] values of `E` are possible solutions.

Then, the time part o the equation can be solved explicitly in the general case, as it does not depend on the potential $V(x)$, and it is just an exponential.

Therefore, all we need to do to solve the general Schrodinger equation is to solve the time-independent version, and then decompose the initial condition in terms of it like as done in \x[solving-partial-differential-equations-with-the-fourier-series]{full}.

Furthermore:
* we immediately see from the equation that the time-independent solutions are states of deterministic energy because the energy is an \x[eigenvalue] of the Hamiltonian operator
* the probability density of such a state does not change with time because the exponential time part cancels out on the conjugate

Now, there are two ways to go about this.

The first is the stupid "here's a guess" + "hey this family of solutions forms a \x[complete-basis]"! This is exactly how we solved the problem at \x[solving-partial-differential-equations-with-the-fourier-series]{full}, except that now the complete basis are the \x[hermite-functions].

And then we can prove the ladder properties easily.

However, orbitals energies for large atoms don't increase in energy like those of hydrogen due to \x[electron]-electron interactions.

The wave equation contains the entire state of a particle.

From \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics] remember that the wave equation is a vector in \x[hilbert-space].

And a single vector can be represented in many different ways in different basis, and two of those ways happen to be the position and the momentum representations.

More importantly, position and momentum are first and foremost operators associated with observables: the \x[position-operator] and the \x[momentum-operator]. And both of their eigenvalue sets form a basis of the \x[hilbert-space] according to the \x[spectral-theorem].

When you represent a wave equation as a function, you have to say what the variable of the function means. And depending on weather you say "it means position" or "it means momentum", the position and momentum operators will be written differently.

This is well shown at: \x[video-visualization-of-quantum-physics-quantum-mechanics-by-udiprod-2017].

Furthermore, the position and momentum representations are equivalent: one is the \x[fourier-transform] of the other: \x[position-and-momentum-space]. Remember that notably we can always take the Fourier transform of a function in \x[l2] due to \x[carleson-s-theorem].

Then the uncertainty principle follows immediately from a general property of the Fourier transform: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fourier_transform&oldid=961707157#Uncertainty_principle

In precise terms, the \x[uncertainty-principle] talks about the \x[standard-deviation] of two measures.

We can visualize the uncertainty principle more intuitively by thinking of a \x[wave-function] that is a \x[real-number][real] \x[flat-top-bump-function] with a flat top in \x[1d]. We can then change the width of the support, but when we do that, the top goes higher to keep probability equal to 1. The momentum is 0 everywhere, except in the edges of the support. Then:
* to localize the wave in space at position 0 to reduce the space uncertainty, we have to reduce the support. However, doing so makes the momentum variation on the edges more and more important, as the slope will go up and down faster (higher top, and less x space for descent), leading to a larger variance (note that average momentum is still 0, due to to symmetry of the bump function)
* to localize the momentum as much as possible at 0, we can make the support wider and wider. This makes the bumps at the edges smaller and smaller. However, this also obviously delocalises the wave function more and more, increasing the variance of x

= Position and momentum space
{parent=uncertainty-principle}
{wiki}

One of the main reasons why physicists are obsessed by this topic is that position and momentum are mapped to the \x[phase-space-coordinate]{p} of \x[hamiltonian-mechanics], which appear in the \x[matrix-mechanics] formulation of \x[quantum-mechanics], which offers insight into the theory, particularly when generalizing to \x[relativistic-quantum-mechanics].

One way to think is: what is the definition of space space? It is a way to write the wave function $\psi_x(x)$ such that:
* the position operator is the multiplication by $x$
* the momentum operator is the derivative by $x$
And then, what is the definition of momentum space? It is of course a way to write the wave function $\psi_p(p)$ such that:
* the momentum operator is the multiplication by $p$

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/39442/intuitive-explanation-of-why-momentum-is-the-fourier-transform-variable-of-posit/39508#39508 gives the best idea intuitive idea: the \x[fourier-transform] writes a function as a (continuous) sum of plane waves, and each plane wave has a fixed momentum.

A way to write the wavefunction $\psi(x)$ such that the \x[position-operator] is:
$$x$$
i.e., a function that takes the wavefunction as input, and outputs another function:
$$x \psi(x)$$

If you believe that \x[mathematician]{p} took care of \x[continuous-spectrum-functional-analysis] for us and that everything just works, the most concrete and direct thing that this representation tells us is that:
\Q[the probability of finding a particle between $x_0$ and $x_1$ at time $t$]
equals:
$$\int_{x_0}^{x_1}x \psi{x, t} dx$$

= Position operator

This operator case is surprisingly not necessarily mathematically trivial to describe formally because you often end up getting into the \x[dirac-delta-function]{p}/continuous spectrum: as mentioned at: \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics]

{parent=position-and-momentum-space}
{wiki}

One dimension in \x[position-representation]:
$$
\hat{p} = - i \hbar \pdv{}{x}

In three dimensions In position representation, we define it by using the \x[gradient], and so we see that 
$$
\hat{p} = - i \hbar \pdv{}{x}
$$

= Angular momentum operator
{parent=uncertainty-principle}
{wiki}

Basically the operators are just analogous to the classical ones e.g. the classical:
$$L_z = x p_y - y p_x$$
becomes:
$$\hat{L}_z = -i \hbar \left( x\pdv{}{y} - y\pdv{}{x} \right)$$

Besides the angular momentum in each direction, we also have the \x[total-angular-momentum]:
$$\hat{L}^2 = \hat{L}_x + \hat{L}_y + \hat{L}_z$$

Then you have to understand what each one of those does to the each \x[atomic-orbital]:
* total angular momentum: determined by the \x[azimuthal-quantum-number]
* angular momentum in one direction ($z$ by convention): determined by the \x[magnetic-quantum-number]

There is an \x[uncertainty-principle] between the x, y and z angular momentums, we can only measure one of them with certainty at a time. \x[video-quantum-mechanics-7a-angular-momentum-i-by-viascience-2013] justifies this intuitively by mentioning that this is analogous to \x[precession]: if you try to measure electrons e.g. with the \x[zeeman-effect] the precess on the other directions which you end up modifing.

This is in contrast to classical mechanics where e.g. the state of mechanical system is given by two real functions: position and speed.

Relates particle momentum and its wavelength, or equivalently, energy and frequency.

The wavelength relation is:

\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$
but since:
$$
v = \lambda f
E = p v
$$
the wavelength relation implies:
$$
\frac{v}{f} = \frac{h}{p}
f = \frac{v p}{h}  = \frac{E}{h}
$$

Particle wavelength can be for example measured very directly on a \x[double-slit-experiment].

So if we take for example electrons of different speeds, we should be able to see the diffraction pattern change accordingly.

Published by \x[werner-heisenberg] in 1925-07-25 as \x[quantum-mechanical-re-interpretation-of-kinematic-and-mechanical-relations-by-heisenberg-1925], it offered the first general formulation of quantum mechanics.

It is apparently more closely related to the \x[ladder-operator] method, which is a more \x[algebraic] than the more \x[analytical] \x[schrodinger-equation].

It appears that this formulation makes the importance of the \x[poisson-bracket] clear, and explains why \x[physicist]{p} are so obsessed with talking about \x[position-and-momentum-space].

And analogously for matter, appears in the \x[de-broglie-relations] relating momentum and frequency. Also appears in the \x[schrodinger-equation], basically as a consequence/cause of the de Broglie relations most likely.

Intuitively, the \x[planck-constant] determines at what length scale do quantum effects start to show up for a given energy scale. It is because the Plank constant is very small that we don't perceive quantum effects on everyday energy/length/time scales. On the $\lim_{h \to 0}$, quantum mechanics disappears entirely.

Predicted by the \x[dirac-equation].

We've likely known since forever that \x[photon]{p} are created: just turn on a light and see gazillion of them come out!

Photon creation is easy because photons are massless, so there is not minimum energy to create them.

The creation of other particles is much rarer however, and took longer to be discovered, one notable milestone being the discovery of the \x[positron].

In the case of the electron, we need to start with at least enough energy for the mass of the electron positron pair. This requires a photon with wavelength in the \x[picometer] range, which is not common in the thermal radiation of daily life.

= Derivation of the Dirac equation
{parent=dirac-equation}

The \x[dirac-equation] can be derived basically "directly" from the \x[representation-theory-of-the-lorentz-group] for the \x[spin-half] representation, this is shown for example at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] 6.3 "Dirac Equation".

The Diract equation is the \x[spacetime-symmetry] part of the \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian], i.e. is describes how \x[spin-half] particles behave without interactions. The full \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian] can then be reached by adding the \x[u-1] \x[internal-symmetry].

As mentioned at \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics], this same method allows us to analogously derive the equations for other \x[spin-number]{p}.

$$
\partial_i \partial^i \psi - m^2 \psi = 0
$$

Has some issues which are solved by the \x[dirac-equation]:
* it has a second time derivative of the \x[wave-function]. Therefore, to solve it we must specify not only the initial value of the wave equation, but also the derivative of the wave equation, 

  As mentioned at \x[advanced-quantum-mechanics-by-freeman-dyson-1951] and further clarified at: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/340023/cant-the-negative-probabilities-of-klein-gordon-equation-be-avoided[], this would lead to negative probabilities.
* the modulus of the wave function is not constant and therefore not always one, and therefore cannot be interpreted as a probability density anymore
* since we are working with the square of the energy, we have both positive and negative value solutions. This is also a features of the \x[dirac-equation] however.

= Derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation
{c}
{parent=klein-gordon-equation}

The Klein-Gordon equation directly uses a more naive \x[relativistic-energy] guess of $p^2 + m^2$ squared.

But since this is \x[quantum-mechanics], we feel like making $p$ into the "\x[momentum-operator]", just like in the \x[schrodinger-equation].

But we don't really know how to apply the momentum operator twice, because it is a \x[gradient], so the first application goes from a scalar field to the vector field, and the second one...

So we just cheat and try to use the \x[laplace-operator] instead because there's some squares on it:
$$
H = \laplacian{} + m^2
$$

But then, we have to avoid taking the square root to reach a first derivative in time, because we don't know how to take the square root of that operator expression.

So the Klein-Gordon equation just takes the approach of using this squared Hamiltonian instead.

Since it is a Hamiltonian, and comparing it to the \x[schrodinger-equation] which looks like:
$$
H \psi = i \pdv{\psi}{t}
$$
taking the Hamiltonian twice leads to:
$$
H^2 \psi = - \pdv{^2 \psi}{^2 t}
$$

We can contrast this with the \x[dirac-equation], which instead attempts to explicitly construct an operator which squared coincides with the relativistic formula: \x[derivation-of-the-dirac-equation].

= Spin
{disambiguate=physics}
{parent=dirac-equation}

Spin is one of the \x[defining-properties-of-elementary-particles], i.e. number that describes how an \x[elementary-particle] behaves, much like \x[electric-charge] and \x[mass].

Possible values are half integer numbers: 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and so on.

The approach shown in this section: \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics]{c}{full} shows what the spin number actually means in general. As shown there, the spin number it is a direct consequence of having the laws of nature be \x[lorentz-invariant]. Different spin numbers are just different ways in which this can be achieved as per different \x[representation-of-the-lorentz-group].

\x[video-quantum-mechanics-9a-photon-spin-and-schrodinger-s-cat-i-by-viascience-2013] explains nicely how:
* incorporated into the \x[dirac-equation] as a natural consequence of \x[special-relativity] corrections, but not naturally present in the \x[schrodinger-equation], see also: \x[the-dirac-equation-predicts-spin]{child}
* \x[photon] spin can be either linear or circular
* the linear one can be made from a superposition of circular ones
* straight antennas produce linearly polarized photos, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helical_antenna[Helical antennas] circularly polarized ones
* a jump between 2s and 2p in an atom changes angular momentum. Therefore, the photon must carry angular momentum as well as energy.
* cannot be classically explained, because even for a very large estimate of the electron size, its surface would have to spin faster than light to achieve that magnetic momentum with the known \x[electron-charge]
* as shown at \x[video-quantum-mechanics-12b-dirac-equation-ii-by-viascience-2015], observers in different \x[frame-of-reference][frames of reference] see different spin states

\x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 3.9 "Elementary particles" has an amazing summary of the preceding chapters the \x[spin-physics] value has a relation to the \x[representation-theory][representations] of the \x[lorentz-group], which encodes the \x[spacetime-symmetry] that each particle observes.

{title2}

Theoretical framework on which quantum field theories are based, theories based on framework include:
* \x[quantum-electrodynamics]
* \x[quantum-chromodynamics]
so basically the entire \x[standard-model]

The basic idea is that there is a field for each particle particle type.

E.g. in QED, one for the \x[electron] and one for the \x[photon]: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/166709/are-electron-fields-and-photon-fields-part-of-the-same-field-in-qed[].

And then those fields interact with some \x[lagrangian].

One way to look at QFT is to split it into two parts:
* deriving the Lagrangians of the \x[standard-model]: \x[why-do-symmetries-such-as-su-3-su-2-and-u-1-matter-in-particle-physics]. This is the easier part, since the lagrangians themselves can be understood with not very advanced mathematics, and derived beautifully from symmetry constraints
* the qantization of fields. This is the hard part \x[ciro-santilli] is unable to understand, TODO \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-field-theory].
Then interwined with those two is the part "OK, how to solve the equations, if they are solvable at all", which is an open problem: \x[yang-mills-existence-and-mass-gap].

There appear to be two main equivalent formulations of quantum field theory:

TODO holy crap, even this is hard to understand/find a clear definition of.

The \x[dirac-equation], OK, is a \x[partial-differential-equation], so we can easily understand its definition with basic calculus. We may not be able to solve it efficiently, but at least we understand it.

But what the heck is the mathematical model for a quantum field theory? TODO someone was saying it is equivalent to an infinite set of PDEs somehow. Investigate. Related:

The \x[path-integral-formulation] might actually be the most understandable formulation, as shown at \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].

The formulation of QFT also appears to be a form of infinite-dimentional calculus.

\x[quantum-electrodynamics-by-lifshitz-et-al-2nd-edition-1982] chapter 1. "The uncertainty principle in the relativistic case" contains an interesting idea:
\Q[The foregoing discussion suggests that the theory will not consider the time dependence of particle interaction processes. It will show that in these processes there are no characteristics precisely definable (even within the usual limitations of quantum mechanics); the description of such a process as occurring in the course of time is therefore just as unreal as the classical paths are in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The only observable quantities are the properties (momenta,
polarizations) of free particles: the initial particles which come into interaction, and the final particles which result from the process.]

* convenient for \x[condensed-matter-physics] because there you have a gazillion particles occupying entire \x[electronic-band-theory][energy bands]

This one might actually be understandable! It is what \x[richard-feynman] starts to explain at: \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].

The difficulty is then proving that the total probability remains at 1, and maybe causality is hard too.

The path integral formulation can be seen as a generalization of the \x[double-slit-experiment] to infinitely many slits.

Feynman first stared working it out for \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics], with the relativistic goal in mind, and only later on he attained the relativistic goal.

TODO why intuitively did he take that approach? Likely is makes it easier to add \x[special-relativity].

This approach more directly suggests the idea that \x[quantum-particles-take-all-possible-paths].

Theory that describes \x[electron]{p} and \x[photon]{p} really well, and \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979][as Feynman puts it] "accounts very precisely for all physical phenomena we have ever observed, except for gravity and nuclear physics" ("including the laughter of the crowd" ;-)).

Learning it is one of \x[ciro-santilli]'s main intellectual \x[fetish]{p}.

While Ciro acknowledges that QED is intrinsically challenging due to the wide range or requirements (\x[quantum-mechanics], \x[special-relativity] and \x[electromagnetism]), Ciro feels that there is a glaring gap in this moneyless market for a learning material that follows the \x[middle-way] as mentioned at: \x[the-missing-link-between-basic-and-advanced]. \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979] is one of the best attempts so far, but it falls a bit too close to the superficial side of things, if only Feynman hadn't assumed that the audience doesn't know any mathematics...

The funny thing is that when \x[ciro-santilli-s-mother] retired, learning it (or as she put it: "how photons and electrons interact") was also one of her retirement plans. She is a pharmacist by training, and doesn't know much \x[mathematics], and her \x[english-language] was \x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world][somewhat limited]. Oh, she also wanted to learn how \x[photosynthesis] works (possibly not fully understood by science as that time, 2020). Ambitious old lady!!!

Experiments: \x[quantum-electrodynamics-experiments].

Combines \x[special-relativity] with more classical \x[quantum-mechanics], but further generalizing the \x[dirac-equation], which also does that: \x[dirac-equation-vs-quantum-electrodynamics].

Before QED, the most advanced theory was that of the \x[dirac-equation], which was already relativistic but TODO what was missing there exactly?

As summarized at: https://youtube.com/watch?v=_AZdvtf6hPU?t=305[] Quantum Field Theory lecture at the African Summer Theory Institute 1 of 4 by Anthony Zee (2004):
* classical mechanics describes large and slow objects
* special relativity describes large and fast objects (they are getting close to the speed of light, so we have to consider relativity)
* classical \x[quantum-mechanics] describes small and slow objects.
* QED describes objects that are both small and fast

That video also mentions the interesting idea that:
* in special relativity, we have the \x[mass-energy-equivalence]
* in quantum mechanics, thinking along the \x[time-energy-uncertainty-principle], $\Delta E \sim \frac{1}{\Delta t}$
Therefore, for small timescales, energy can vary a lot. But mass is equivalent to energy. Therefore, for small time scale, particles can appear and disappear wildly.

QED is the first \x[quantum-field-theory] fully developed. That framework was later extended to also include the \x[weak-interaction] and \x[strong-interaction]. As a result, it is perhaps easier to just \x[google] for "Quantum Field Theory" if you want to learn QED, since QFT is more general and has more resources available generally.

Like in more general quantum field theory, there is on field for each particle type. In quantum field theory, there are only two fields to worry about:
* \x[photon] field
* \x[electromagnetism] field

where:
* $F$ is the \x[electromagnetic-tensor]

Note that this is the sum of the:
* \x[dirac-lagrangian], which  only describes the "inertia of bodies" part of the equation

Note that the relationship between $\psi$ and $F$ is not explicit. However, if we knew what type of particle we were talking about, e.g. \x[electron], then the knowledge of \x[psi] would also give the charge distribution and therefore $F$

As mentioned at the beginning of \x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-notes-by-david-tong-2007]:

\Video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFRyN3fQMO8]
{title=Deriving the \x[qed-lagrangian] by \x[dietterich-labs] (2018)}
{description=As mentioned at the start of the video, he starts with the \x[dirac-equation] Lagrangian derived in a previous video. It has nothing to do with \x[electromagnetism] specifically.

He notes that that \x[dirac-lagrangian], besides being globally \x[lorentz-invariant], it also also has a global \x[u-1] invariance.

However, it does not have a local invariance if the \x[u-1] transformation depends on the point in spacetime.

He doesn't mention it, but I think this is highly desirable, because in general \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents], and in this case we want conservation of charges.

To fix that, he adds an extra \x[gauge-field] $A_\mu$ (a field of $4 \times 4$ matrices) to the regular derivative, and the resulting derivative has a fancy name: the \x[covariant-derivative].

Then finally he notes that this \x[gauge-field] he had to add has to transform exactly like the \x[electromagnetic-four-potential]!

So he uses that as the gauge, and also adds in the \x[maxwell-lagrangian] in the same go. It is kind of a guess, but it is a natural guess, and it turns out to be correct.

= What does it mean that photons are force carriers for electromagnetism?
{parent=quantum-electrodynamics}

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/61095/photon-as-the-carrier-of-the-electromagnetic-force

TODO find/create decent answer.

I think the best answer is something along:
* \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents]. $U(1)$ gives conserved charges.
* OK now. We want a local $U(1)$ symmetry. And we also want:
  * \x[dirac-equation]: quantum relativistic Newton's laws that specify what forces do to the fields
  * \x[electromagnetism]: specifies what causes forces based on currents. But not what it does to masses.
  Given all of that, the most obvious and direct thing we reach a guess at the \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian] is \x[video-deriving-the-qed-lagrangian-by-dietterich-labs-2018]

A basic non-precise intuition is that a good model of reality is that electrons do not "interact with one another directly via the electromagnetic field".

A better model happens to be the \x[quantum-field-theory] view that the electromagnetic field interacts with the photon field but not directly with itself, and then the photon field interacts with parts of the electromagnetic field further away.

The more precise statement is that the \x[photon-field] is a gauge field of the electromagnetic force under local U(1) symmetry, which is described by a \x[lie-group]. TODO understand.

This idea was first applied in \x[general-relativity], where \x[einstein] understood that the "force of \x[gravity]" can be understood just in terms of symmetry and curvature of space. This was later applied o \x[quantum-electrodynamics] and the entire \x[standard-model].

From \x[video-lorenzo-sadun-on-the-yang-mills-and-mass-gap-millennium-problem]:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCQ9GIqpGBI&t=1663s mentions this idea first came about from \x[hermann-weyl].

By \x[richard-feynman]{parent}.

Talk title shown on intro: "Today's Answers to Newton's Queries about Light".

6 hour lecture, where he tries to explain it to an audience that does not know any modern physics. This is a noble effort.

Part of The Douglas Robb Memorial Lectures lecture series.

Feynman apparently also made a book adaptation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED:_The_Strange_Theory_of_Light_and_Matter[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]. That book is basically word by word the same as the presentation, including the diagrams.

According to http://www.feynman.com/science/qed-lectures-in-new-zealand/ the official upload is at http://www.vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8[] and Vega does show up as a watermark on the video (though it is too pixilated to guess without knowing it), a project that has been discontinued and has has a non-permissive license. Newbs.

4 parts:
* Part 1: is saying "\x[photon]{p} exist"
* Part 2: is amazing, and describes how photons move as a sum of all possible paths, not sure if it is relativistic at all though, and suggests that something is minimized in that calculation (the \x[action-physics])
* Part 3: is where he hopelessly tries to explain the crucial part of how electrons join the picture in a similar manner to how photons do.

  He does make the link to light, saying that there is a function $P(A, B)$ which gives the amplitude for a photon going from A to B, where A and B are spacetime events.

  And then he mentions that there is a similar function $E(A, B)$ for an electron to go from A to B, but says that that function is too complicated, and gives no intuition unlike the photon one.

  He does not mention it, but P and E are the so called \x[propagator]{p}.

  This is likely the \x[path-integral-formulation] of QED.

  On \x[quantum-mechanical-view-of-reality-by-richard-feynman-1983] he mentions that $E$ is a \x[bessel-function], without giving further detail.

  And also mentions that:
  $$
  E = f(1, 2, m) \\
  P = f(1, 2, 0)
  $$
  where `m` is basically a scale factor.
  such that both are very similar. And that something similar holds for many other particles.

  And then, when you draw a \x[feynman-diagram], e.g. electron emits photon and both are detected at given positions, you sum over all the possibilities, each amplitude is given by:
  $$
  c \times E(A, D) \times E(D, B) \times P(B, C)
  $$
  summed over all possible $D$ \x[spacetime] points.

  This is basically well said at: https://youtu.be/rZvgGekvHes?t=3349 from \x[quantum-mechanical-view-of-reality-by-richard-feynman-1983].

  TODO: how do electron velocities affect where they are likely to end up? $E(A, D)$ suggests the probability only depends on the spacetime points.

  Also, this clarifies why computations in QED are so insane: you have to sum over every possible point in space!!! TODO but then how do we calculate anything at all in practice?
* Part 4: known problems with QED and thoughts on QCD. Boring.
This talk has the merit of being very experiment oriented on part 2, big kudos: \x[how-to-teach-and-learn-physics]

Basically the same content as: \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979], but maybe there is some merit to this talk, as it is a bit more direct in some points. This is consistent with what is mentioned at http://www.feynman.com/science/qed-lectures-in-new-zealand/ that the Auckland lecture was the first attempt.

They are mostly a \x[new-age] production company it seems, which highlights Feynman's absolute cult status. E.g. on the last video, he's not wearing shoes, like a proper guru.

Feynman liked to meet all kinds of weird people, and at some point he got interested in the \x[new-age] \x[esalen-institute]. \x[surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman] this kind of experience a bit, there was nude bathing on a pool that oversaw the sea, and a guy offered to give a massage to the he nude girl and the accepted.

https://youtu.be/rZvgGekvHest=5105 actually talks about \x[spin-physics], notably that the endpoint events also have a spin, and that the transition rules take spin into account by rotating thing, and that the transition rules take spin into account by rotating things.

= Weak force
{synonym}

Explains \x[beta-decay]. TODO why/how.

Maybe a good view of why this force was needed given \x[beta-decay] experiments is: in beta decay, a \x[neutron] is getting split up into an \x[electron] and a \x[proton]. Therefore, those charges must be contained inside the neutron somehow to start with. But then what could possibly make a positive and a negative particle separate?
* the \x[electromagnetic-force] should hold them together
* the \x[strong-force] seems to hold positive charges together. Could it then be pushing opposite-charges apart? Why not?
* \x[gravity] is too weak

http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/Weak-nuclear-force.html gives a quick and dirty:
\Q[
Beta decay could not be explained by the strong nuclear force, the force that's responsible for holding the atomic nucleus together, because this force doesn't affect electrons. It couldn't be explained by the electromagnetic force, because this does not affect \x[neutron]{p}, and the force of \x[gravity] is far too weak to be responsible. Since this new atomic force was not as strong as the strong nuclear force, it was dubbed the weak nuclear force.
]
Also interesting:
\Q[
While the photon 'carries' charge, and therefore mediates the \x[electromagnetic-force], the \x[z-boson][Z] and \x[w-boson][W] \x[boson]{p} are said to carry a property known as 'weak isospin'. \x[w-boson]{p} mediate the weak force when particles with charge are involved, and \x[z-boson]{p} mediate the weak force when neutral particles are involved.

{parent=quantum-field-theory}

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/106392/internal-and-spacetime-symmetries

The different only shows up for \x[field-physics], not with particles. For fields, there are two types of changes that we can make that can keep the \x[lagrangian] unchanged as mentioned at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter "4.5.2 Noether's Theorem for Field Theories - Spacetime":
* \x[spacetime-symmetry]: act with the \x[poincare-group] on the \x[four-vector] spacetime inputs of the field itself, i.e. transforming $L(\Phi(x), \partial \Phi(x), dx)$ into $L(\Phi'(x'), \partial \Phi'(x'), x')$
* \x[internal-symmetry]: act on the output of the  field, i.e.: $L(\Phi(x) + \delta \Phi(x), \partial (\Phi(x) + \delta \Phi(x)), x)$

From \x[defining-properties-of-elementary-particles]:
* spacetime:
  * \x[mass]
  * \x[spin-physics]
* internal
  * \x[electric-charge]
  * \x[weak-charge]
  * \x[color-charge]

From the spacetime theory alone, we can derive the \x[lagrangian] for the free theories for each \x[spin-physics]:
* \x[spin-0]: \x[klein-gordon-equation]
* \x[spin-half]: \x[dirac-equation]
* \x[spin-1]: \x[proca-equation]
Then the internal symmetries are what add the interaction part of the \x[lagrangian], which then completes the \x[standard-model-lagrangian].

Don't redistribute clause, and final version by Cambridge University Press, alas, so corrections will never be merged back: http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html[]. But at least he's collecing erratas for the published (and therefore draft) versions there.

The book is top-level organized in spin 0, spin half, and spin 1. Quite ominous, really.

The preface states that one of its pedagogical philosophies is to "Illustration of the basic concepts with the simplest examples.", so maybe there is hope after all.

Non-relativistic \x[qft] is a limit of relativistic QFT, and can be used to describe for example \x[condensed-matter-physics] systems at very low temperature. But it is still very hard to make accurate measurements even in those experiments.

Defines "relativistic" as: "the \x[lagrangian] is symmetric under the \x[poincare-group]".

Mentions that "QFT is hard" because (a finite list follows???):
\Q[There are no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary \x[representation-theory][representations] of the \x[poincare-group].]
But I guess that if you fully understand what that means precisely, QTF won't be too hard for you!

Notably, this is stark contrast with rotation symmetry groups (\x[special-orthogonal-group][SO(3)]) which appears in space rotations present in \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics].

= Quantum superposition
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

Quantum superposition is really weird because it is fundamentally different than "either definite state but I don't know which", because the superposition state leads to different measurements than the non-superposition state.

Examples:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt8gVXDsh7Q "Interference in quantum mechanics" by \x[looking-glass-universe] (2015) shows how a left-right \x[spin-physics] measurement has a defined value for a superposed half up half down state, but not for a pure up state.

  TODO can this be conducted? As mentioned in the video, this is closely linked to the fact that you can describe the wave function in multiple different bases (up/down or left/right), which is also at the root of the \x[uncertainty-principle].
* \x[video-quantum-mechanics-9b-photon-spin-and-schrodinger-s-cat-ii-by-viascience-2013] gives a similar photon version
* it seems that the \x[single-particle-double-slit-experiment] can also be thought of as in terms of a superposition of "the particle goes through the right" and "the particle goes through the right", although it is a bit harder to thing about as it is not a \x[discrete] process

= Quantum entanglement
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

Quantum entanglement is often called spooky/surprising/unintuitive, but they key question is to understand why.

To understand that, you have to understand why it is fundamentally impossible for the entangled particle pair be in a predefined state \x[bell-test-experiment][according to experiments done] e.g. where one is deterministically yes and the other deterministically down.

In other words, why \x[local-hidden-variable-theory] is not valid.

How to generate entangled particles:
* \x[particle-decay], notably \x[pair-production]
* for \x[photon]{p}, notably: \x[spontaneous-parametric-down-conversion], e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn1sEaw1K2k "Shanni Prutchi Construction of an Entangled Photon Source" by HACKADAY (2015). Estimatd price: 5000 USD.

{synonym}

\x[ciro-santilli] finds it interesting that radioactive decay basically kickstarted the domain of \x[nuclear-physics] by essentially providing a natural \x[particle-accelerator] from a chunk of radioactive element.

The discovery process was particularly interesting, including \x[henri-becquerel]'s luck while observing \x[phosphorescence], and \x[marie-curie]'s observation that the \x[uranium] \x[ore] were more radioactive than pure uranium, and must therefore contain other even more radioactive substances, which lead to the discovery of \x[polonium] (\x[half-life] 138 days) and \x[radium] (half-life 1600 years).

= Alpha decay
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

Most of the \x[helium] in the Earth's atmosphere comes from alpha decay, since helium is lighter than air and naturally escapes out out of the atmosphere.

Wiki mentions that alpha decay is well modelled as a \x[quantum-tunnelling] event, see also \x[geiger-nuttall-law].

As a result of that law, alpha particles have relatively little energy variation around 5 MeV or a speed of about 5% of the \x[speed-of-light] for any element, because the energy is inversely exponentially proportional to \x[half-life]. This is because:
* if the energy is much larger, decay is very fast and we don't have time to study the \x[isotope]
* if the energy is much smaller, decay is very rare and we don't have enough events to observe at all

\x[uranium]{c} emits them, you can see their mass to charge ratio under magnetic field and so deduce that they are \x[electron]{p}.

Caused by \x[weak-interaction] TODO why/how.

The emitted electron kinetic energy is random from zero to a maximum value. The rest goes into a \x[neutrino]. This is how the neutrino was first discovered/observed indirectly. This is well illustrated in a \x[decay-scheme] such as \x[image-caesium-137-decay-scheme].

= Gamma ray
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

Most commonly known as a byproduct \x[radioactive-decay].

A \x[decay-scheme] such as \x[image-caesium-137-decay-scheme] illustrates well how gamma radiation happens as a byproduct of \x[radioactive-decay] due to the existence of \x[nuclear-isomer].

Gamma rays are pretty cool as they give us insight into the energy levels/different configurations of the nucleus.

They have also been used as early sources of high energy particles for \x[particle-physics] experiments before the development of \x[particle-accelerator]{p}, serving a similar purpose to \x[cosmic-ray]{p} in those early days.

But \x[gamma-ray]{p} they were more convenient in some cases because you could more easily manage them inside a \x[laboratory] rather than have to go climb some bloody mountain or a \x[balloon].

The \x[positron] for example was first observed on \x[cosmic-ray]{p}, but better confirmed in \x[gamma-ray] experiments by \x[carl-david-anderson].

= Half-life
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

The \x[half-life] of \x[radioactive-decay], which as discovered a few years before \x[quantum-mechanics] was discovered and matured, was a major mystery. Why do some nuclei fission in apparently random fashion, while others don't? How is the state of different nuclei different from one another? This is mentioned in \x[inward-bound-by-abraham-pais-1988] Chapter 6.e Why a half-life?

The term also sees use in other areas, notably \x[biology], where e.g. \x[rna]{p} spontaneously decay as part of the \x[cell]'s \x[control-system], see e.g. mentions in \x[e-coli-whole-cell-model-by-covert-lab].

The old laws of Coulomb and Newton involve "action at a distance". This means that the force felt by an electron (or planet) changes immediately if a distant \x[proton] (or star) moves. This situation is philosophically unsatisfactory. More importantly, it is also experimentally wrong. The field theories of Maxwell and Einstein remedy the situation, with all interactions mediated in a local fashion by the field.

This is also mentioned e.g. at \x[video-the-quantum-experiment-that-almost-broke-locality-by-the-science-asylum-2019].

In simple terms, if you believe in the \x[schrodinger-equation] and its modern probabilistic interpretation as described in the \x[schrodinger-picture], then at first it seem that there is no strict causality to the outcome of experiments.

People have then tried to recover that by assuming that there is some inner sate beyond the \x[schrodinger-equation], but these ideas are refuted by \x[bell-test-experiment]{p}, unless we give up the \x[principle-of-locality], which feels more important, especially in \x[special-relativity], where \x[faster-than-light-implies-time-travel], which breaks causality even more dramatically.

The \x[de-broglie-bohm-theory] is a deterministic but \x[non-local] formulation of quantum mechanics.

Includes fun things like:
* \x[superconductivity] and \x[superfluidity]
* \x[semiconductor]{p}

As of 2020, this is the other "fundamental branch of physics" besides to \x[particle-physics]/\x[nuclear-physics].

Condensed matter is basically \x[chemistry] but without reactions: you study a fixed state of matter, not a reaction in which compositions change with time.

Just like in chemistry, you end up getting some very well defined substance properties due to the incredibly large number of atoms.

Just like chemistry, the ultimate goal is to do de-novo \x[computational-chemistry] to predict those properties.

And just like chemistry, what we can actually is actually very limited in part due to the exponential nature of \x[quantum-mechanics].

Also since chemistry involves reactions, chemistry puts a huge focus on liquids and solutions, which is the simplest state of matter to do reactions in.

Condensed matter however can put a lot more emphasis on solids than chemistry, notably because solids are what we generally want in end products, no one likes stuff leaking right?

But it also studies liquids, e.g. notably \x[superfluidity].

One thing condensed matter is particularly obsessed with is the fascinating phenomena of \x[phase-transition].

{c}
{parent=statistical-physics}

A good conceptual starting point is to like the example that is mentioned at \x[the-harvest-of-a-century-by-siegmund-brandt-2008].

Consider a system with 2 particles and 3 states. Remember that:
* in \x[quantum-statistics] (\x[bose-einstein-statistics] and \x[fermi-dirac-statistics]), particles are indistinguishable, therefore, we might was well call both of them `A`, as opposed to `A` and `B` from non-quantum statistics
* in \x[bose-einstein-statistics], two particles may occupy the same state. In \x[fermi-dirac-statistics]

Therefore, all the possible way to put those two particles in three states are for:
* \x[maxwell-boltzmann-distribution]: both A and B can go anywhere:
  \Table[
  || State 1
  || State 2
  || State 3

  |

  | B

  |
  | B
  | A
  ]
* \x[bose-einstein-statistics]: because A and B are indistinguishable, there is now only 1 possibility for the states where A and B would be in different states.
  \Table[
  || State 1
  || State 2
  || State 3

  || State 2
  || State 3

  | A
  | A
  |

  | A
  |
  | A

  |

  ]

Both \x[bose-einstein-statistics] and \x[fermi-dirac-statistics] tend to the \x[maxwell-boltzmann-distribution] in the limit of either:
* high \x[temperature]
* low concentrations

$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S$$

At least from the formula we see that:
* the more exothermic, the more likely it is to occur
* if the entropy increases, the higher the temperature, the more likely it is to occur
  * otherwise, the lower the temperature the more likely it is to occur

A prototypical example of reaction that is exothermic but does not happen at any temperature is combustion.

I think these are the ones where $\Delta H \times \Delta S > 0$, i.e. \x[enthalpy] and \x[entropy] push the reaction in different directions. And so we can use temperature to move the \x[chemical-equilibrium] back and forward.

\x[subtle-is-the-lord-by-abraham-pais-1982] chapter 4 "Entropy and Probability" mentions well how \x[boltzmann] first thought that the second law was an actual base physical law of the universe while he was calculating numerical stuff for it, including as late as 1872.

But then he saw an argument by \x[johann-joseph-loschmidt] that given the \x[time-reversibility-of-classical-mechanics], and because they were thinking of atoms as classical balls as in the \x[kinetic-theory-of-gases], then there always exist a valid physical state where entropy decreases, by just reversing the direction of time and all particle speeds.

So from this he understood that the second law can only be probabilistic, and not a fundamental law of physics, which he published clearly in 1877.

{c}
{parent=mechanics}
{wiki}

Originally it was likely created to study constrained mechanical systems where you want to use some "custom convenient" variables to parametrize things instead of global x, y, z. Classical examples that you must have in mind include:
* \x[compound-atwood-machine]. Here, we can use the coordinates as the heights of masses relative to the \x[axle]{p} rather than absolute heights relative to the ground
* \x[double-pendulum], using two angles. The Lagrangian approach is simpler than using Newton's laws
  * \x[pendulum], use angle instead of x/y
* \x[two-body-problem], use the distance between the bodies
\x[lagrangian-mechanics-lectures-by-michel-van-biezen-2017] is a good starting point.

When doing lagrangian mechanics, we just lump together all generalized coordinates into a single vector $\va{q}(t) : \R \to \R^n$ that maps time to the full state:
$$
\va{q}(t) = [q_1(t), q_2(t), q_3(t), ..., q_n(t)]
$$
where each component can be anything, either the x/y/z coordinates relative to the ground of different particles, or angles, or nay other crazy thing we want.

The \x[lagrangian] is a function $\R^n \times \R^n \times \R \to \R$ that maps:
$$
L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)
$$
to a real number.

Then, the \x[stationary-action-principle] says that the actual path taken obeys the \x[euler-lagrange-equation]:
$$
\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{q_i} - \dv{}{t}\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{\dot{q_i}} = 0
$$
This produces a \x[system-of-partial-differential-equations] with:
* $n$ equations
* $n$ unknown functions $q_i$
* at most second order derivatives of $q_i$. Those appear because of the chain rule on the second term.

The mixture of so many derivatives is a bit mind mending, so we can clarify them a bit further. At:
$$
\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{q_i}
$$
the $q_i$ is just identifying which argument of the Lagrangian we are differentiating by: the i-th according to the order of our definition of the Lagrangian. It is not the actual function, just a mnemonic.

Then at:
$$
\dv{}{t}\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{\dot{q_i}}
$$
* the $\pdv{}{\dot{q_i}}$ part is just like the previous term, $\dot{q_i}$ just identifies the argument with index $n + i$ ($n$ because we have the $n$ non derivative arguments)
* after the partial derivative is taken and returns a new function $\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{\dot{q_i}}$, then the \x[multivariable-chain-rule] comes in and expands everything into $2n + 1$ terms

However, people later noticed that the Lagrangian had some nice properties related to \x[lie-group] continuous symmetries.

Basically it seems that the easiest way to come up with new \x[quantum-field-theory] models is to first find the Lagrangian, and then derive the equations of motion from them.

For every \x[continuous-symmetry] in the system (modelled by a \x[lie-group]), there is a corresponding conservation law: \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents].
\x[genius-richard-feynman-and-modern-physics-by-james-gleick-1994] chapter "The Best Path" mentions that \x[richard-feynman] didn't like the \x[lagrangian-mechanics] approach when he started university at \x[mit], because he felt it was too magical. The reason is that the Lagrangian approach basically starts from the principle that "nature minimizes the action across time globally". This implies that things that will happen in the future are also taken into consideration when deciding what has to happen before them! Much like the lifeguard in the \x[lifegard-problem] making global decisions about the future. However, chapter "Least Action in Quantum Mechanics" comments that Feynman later notice that this was indeed necessary while developping \x[wheeler-feynman-absorber-theory] into \x[quantum-electrodynamics], because they felt that it would make more sense to consider things that way while playing with ideas such as \x[positrons-are-electrons-travelling-back-in-time]. This is in contrast with \x[hamiltonian-mechanics], where the idea of time moving foward is more directly present, e.g. as in the \x[schrodinger-equation].

Furthermore, given the symmetry, we can calculate the derived conservation law, and vice versa.

And partly due to the above observations, it was noticed that the easiest way to describe the fundamental laws of \x[particle-physics] and make calculations with them is to first formulate their Lagrangian somehow: \x[why-do-symmetries-such-as-su-3-su-2-and-u-1-matter-in-particle-physics].

{tag=maxima-and-minima}

Calculus of variations is the field that searches for \x[maxima-and-minima] of \x[functional]{p}, rather than the more elementary case of functions from $\R$ to $\R$.

= Functional
{c}
{parent=calculus-of-variations}
{wiki=Euler–Lagrange equation}

A \x[function] that takes input function and outputs a \x[real-number].

= Euler-Lagrange equation
{c}
{parent=calculus-of-variations}
{wiki=Euler–Lagrange equation}

Let's start with the one dimensional case. Let the $q : \R \to \R$ and a \x[functional] $I$ defined by a function of three variables $F : \R^3 \to \R$:
$$I(q) = \int_{t_0}^{t} F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)) dt$$

Then, the \x[euler-lagrange-equation] gives the \x[maxima-and-minima] of the that type of functional. Note that this type of functional is just one very specific type of functional amongst all possible functionals that one might come up with. However, it turns out to be enough to do most of physics, so we are happy with with it.

Given $F$, the Euler-Lagrange equations are a system of \x[ordinary-differential-equation]{p} constructed from that $F$ such that the solutions to that system are the maxima/minima.

In the one dimensional case, the system has a single ordinary differential equation:
$$
\pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{q} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{\dot{q}} = 0
$$

By $\pdv{F}{q}$ and $\pdv{F}{\dot{q}}$ we simply mean "the \x[partial-derivative] of $F$ with respect to its second and third arguments". The notation is a bit confusing at first, but that's all it means.

Therefore, that expression ends up being at most a \x[order-of-a-differential-equation][second order] \x[ordinary-differential-equation] where $q$ is the unknown, since:
* the term $\pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{q}$ is a function of $t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)$
* the term $\pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{\dot{q}}$ is a function of $t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)$. And so it's derivative with respect to time will contain only up to $\ddot{q}$

Now let's think about the multi-dimensional case. Instead of having $q : \R \to \R$, we now have $q : \R \to \R^n$. Think about the \x[lagrangian-mechanics] motivation of a \x[double-pendulum] where for a given time we have two angles.

Let's do the 2-dimensional case then. In that case, $F$ is going to be a function of 5 variables $F : \R^5 \to \R$ rather than 3 as in the one dimensional case, and the functional looks like:
$$I(q) = \int_{t_0}^{t} F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2})(t) dt$$

This time, the Euler-Lagrange equations are going to be a system of two \x[ordinary-differential-equation]{p} on two unknown functions $q_1$ and $q_2$ of order up to 2 in both variables:
$$
\pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t))}{q_1} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t)}{\dot{q_1}} = 0 \\
\pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t))}{q_2} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t)}{\dot{q_2}} = 0 \\
$$
At this point, notation is getting a bit clunky, so people will often condense the $q_i$ vector
$$
\pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{q_1} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{\dot{q_1}} = 0 \\
\pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{q_2} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{\dot{q_2}} = 0 \\
$$
or just omit the arguments of $F$ entirely:
$$
\pdv{F}{q_i} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F}{\dot{q_i}} = 0
$$

Basically: \x[why-do-symmetries-such-as-su-3-su-2-and-u-1-matter-in-particle-physics].

= Lagrangian density
{parent=lagrangian-field-theory}

When we particles particles, the \x[action-physics] is obtained by integrating the \x[lagrangian] over time:
$$
Action = \int_{t_0}^{t} L(x(t), \pdv{x(t)}{t}, t) dt
$$

In the case of \x[field-mathematics]{p} however, we can expand the Lagrangian out further, to also integrate over the space coordinates and their derivatives.

Since we are now working with something that gets integrated over space to obtain the total action, much like \x[density] would be integrated over space to obtain a total mass, the name "Lagrangian density" is fitting.

E.g. for a 2-dimensional field $f(x, y, t)$:
$$
Action = \int_{t_0}^{t} L(f(x, y, t), \pdv{f(x, y, t)}{x}, \pdv{f(x, y, t)}{y}, \pdv{f(x, y, t)}{t}, x, y, t) dx dy dt
$$

Of course, if we were to write it like that all the time we would go mad, so we can just write a much more condensed \x[vectorized] version using the \x[gradient] with $x \in \R^2$:
$$
Action = \int_{t_0}^{t} L(f(x, t), \grad{f(x, t)}, x, t) dx dt
$$

And in the context of \x[special-relativity], people condense that even further by adding $t$ to the spacetime \x[four-vector] as well, so you don't even need to write that separate pesky $t$.

The main point of talking about the Lagrangian density instead of a Lagrangian for fields is likely that it treats space and time in a more uniform way, which is a basic requirement of \x[special-relativity]: we have to be able to mix them up somehow to do \x[lorentz-transformation]{p}. Notably, this is a key ingredient in a/the formulation of \x[quantum-field-theory].

= Generalized coordinate
{parent=lagrangian}

The variables of the \x[lagrangian], e.g. the angles of a \x[double-pendulum]. From that example it is clear that these variables don't need to be simple things like \x[cartesian-coordinate]{p} or \x[polar-coordinate]{p} (although these tend to be the overwhelming majority of simple case encountered): any way to describe the system is perfectly valid.

In \x[quantum-field-theory], those variables are actually fields.

= Noether's theorem
{c}
{parent=lagrangian-mechanics}

For every \x[continuous-symmetry] in the system (\x[lie-group]), there is a corresponding conservation law.

Furthermore, given the symmetry, we can calculate the derived conservation law, and vice versa.

As mentioned at http://buzzard.ups.edu/courses/2017spring/projects/schumann-lie-group-ups-434-2017.pdf[], what the symmetry (\x[lie-group]) acts on (obviously?!) are the \x[lagrangian] \x[generalized-coordinate]{p}. And from that, we immediately guess that manifolds are going to be important, because the generalized variables of the Lagrangian can trivially be \x[non-euclidean-geometry], e.g. the \x[pendulum] lives on an infinite cylinder.

The key difference from \x[lagrangian-mechanics] is that the Hamiltonian approach groups variables into pairs of coordinates called the \x[phase-space-coordinate]{p}:
* generalized coordinates, generally positions or angles
* their corresponding conjugate momenta, generally velocities, or angular velocities
This leads to having two times more unknown functions than in the Lagrangian. However, it also leads to a \x[system-of-partial-differential-equations] with only first order derivatives, which is nicer. Notably, it can be more clearly seen in \x[phase-space].

\x[qed-and-the-men-who-made-it-dyson-feynman-schwinger-and-tomonaga-by-silvan-schweber-1994] chapter 4.1 this conference was soon compared to the \x[first-solvay-conference-1911], which set in motion the development of \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics].

Julian made a formal presentation that took until the afternoon and bored everyone to death, though the mathematics avoided much questioning.

Feynman then presented his revolutionary approach, which he was unable to prove basic properties of, but which gave correct results, and people were not very happy.

{wiki=David_Tong_(physicist)}

A charismatic, perfect-\x[english-language]-accent (\x[received-pronunciation]) \x[physicist] from \x[university-of-cambridge], specializing in \x[quantum-field-theory].

He has done several "\x[vulgarization]" lectures, some of which could be better called undergrad appetizers rather, a notable example being \x[video-quantum-fields-the-real-building-blocks-of-the-universe-by-david-tong-2017] for the prestigious \x[royal-institution], but remains a hardcore researcher: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=felFiY4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate[]. Lots of \x[open-access] publications BTW, so \x[kudos].

The amount of lecture notes on his website looks really impressive: http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html[], he looks like a good educator.

David has also shown some interest in applications of high energy mathematical ideas to \x[condensed-matter], e.g. links between the \x[renormalization-group] and \x[phase-transition] phenomena. TODO there was a YouTube video about that, find it and link here.

"Tong" is of course a transcription of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_(surname)[several major Chinese surnames] and from looks he could be mixed blood, but as mentioned at https://www.ancestry.co.uk/name-origin?surname=tong it can also be an English "metonymic occupational name for a maker or user of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongs[tongs]".

\x[ciro-santilli]'s admiration for Dyson goes beyond his "unify all the things approach", which \x[high-flying-bird-vs-gophers][Ciro loves], but also extends to the way he talks and the things he says. Dyson is one of Ciro's favorite physicist.

Besides this, he was also very \x[idealistic] compassionate, and supported a peaceful resolution until \x[world-war-ii] with \x[united-kingdom] was basically ineviatble. Note that this was a strategic mistake.

Dyson is "hawk nosed" as mentioned in \x[genius-richard-feynman-and-modern-physics-by-james-gleick-1994] chapter "Dyson". But he wasn't when he was young, see e.g. https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/freemandyson_child-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1064&ssl=1 It sems that his nose just never stopped growing after puberty.

He also has some fun stories, like him practicing \x[night-climbing] while at \x[cambridge-university], and having walked from \x[cambridge] to \x[london] (~86km!) in a day with his wheelchair bound friend.

\x[ciro-santilli] feels that the label \x[child-prodigy] applies even more so to him than to \x[feynman] and \x[julian-schwinger].

He was also the person under which \x[freeman-dyson] was originally under when he moved from the \x[united-kingdom] to the \x[united-states].

And Hans also impressed Feynman, both were problem solvers, and liked solving mental arithmetic and \x[numerical-analysis].

This relationship is what brought Feynman to \x[cornell-university] after \x[world-war-ii], Hans' institution, which is where Feynman did the main part of his \x[1965-nobel-prize-in-physics-laureate][Nobel prize winning] work on \x[quantum-electrodynamics].

Extremely precocious, borderline \x[child-prodigy], he was reading \x[dirac] at 13-14 from the library.

He started working at night and sleeping during the moring/early afternoon while he was at university.

He was the type of guy that was so good that he didn't really have to follow the university rules very much. He would get into trouble for not following some stupid requirement, but he was so good that they would just let him get away with it.

Besides \x[quantum-electrodynamics], Julian worked on \x[radar] at the \x[rad-lab] during \x[world-war-ii], unlike most other top \x[physicist]{p} who went to \x[los-alamos-laboratory] to work on the \x[atomic-bomb], and he made important contributions there on calculating the best shape of the parts and so on.

He was known for being very formal mathematically and sometimes hard to understand, in stark contrast to \x[feynman] which was much more lose and understandable, especially after \x[freeman-dyson] translated him to the masses.

However, \x[qed-and-the-men-who-made-it-dyson-feynman-schwinger-and-tomonaga-by-silvan-schweber-1994] does emphacise that he was actually also very practical in the sense that he always aimed to obtain definite numbers out of his calculations, and that was not only the case for the \x[lamb-shift].

Maybe this obsession is partly due to his name which no \x[english-language] speaking person knows how to pronounce from the writing.

\x[qed-and-the-men-who-made-it-dyson-feynman-schwinger-and-tomonaga-by-silvan-schweber-1994] chapter 1.3 "P.A.M. Dirac and the Birth of Quantum Electrodynamics" quotes Dirac saying how being at high school during \x[world-war-i] was an advantage, since all slightly older boys were being sent to war, and so the younger kids were made advance as fast as they could through subjects. Exactly the type of thing \x[ciro-santilli] wants to achieve with \x[ourbigbook-com], but without the need for a world war hopefully.

Dirac was a staunch \x[atheist] having said during the \x[fifth-solvay-conference-1927]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvay_Conference{ref}:
\Q[If we are honest - and scientists have to be - we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards - in heaven if not on earth - all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.]

While learning black-hole stuff is not on top of \x[ciro-santilli]'s priorities, Hawking's spirit is to be admired.

To never give up even when everything seems lost, and still have a sense of humour is respectable.

An ex-physicist colleague who had met Hawking told an anecdote. Hawking was around in the department one day, they said hi and all. But then Hawking wanted to tell a joke. It took like 5 minutes of typing, and you can imagine that things were pretty awkward and the joke's timing was "a bit off". But Hawking did tell the joke nonetheless.

This is also suggested in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Everything_(2014_film)[The Theory of Everything (2014)] film, and therefore likely the biographies.

= Physics and the illusion of life
{parent=philosophy-of-science}
{tag=cirism}
{tag=essays-by-ciro-santilli}

The natural sciences are not just a tool to predict the future.

They are a reminder that the lives that we live daily are mere illusions, just like \x[buddhist]{p} and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)[Hinduists] say.

We as individuals perceive nothing about the materials that we touch every day really work, nor more importantly how our \x[brain] and \x[cell-biology]{p} work.

Everything is magic out of our control.

The natural sciences allow us peek, with huge concentrated effort, into tiny little bits a little of those unknowns, and blow our minds as we notice that we don't know anything.

For all practical purposes in life, there is a huge macro micro gap. We are only able to directly perceive and influence the macro events. And through those we try to affect micro events. Because for good or bad, micro events reflect in the macro world.

Every one or two weeks \x[ciro-santilli] remembers that he and everything he touches are just a bunch of atoms, and that is an amazing feeling.

\x[alan-watts]'s \x[video-alan-watts-philosopher-talk]["Philosopher" talk] mentions related ideas:
\Q[The origin of a person who is defined as a philosopher, is one who finds that existence itself is exceedingly odd.]

The toddler of a friend of \x[ciro-santilli-s-wife] asked her mum:
\Q[Why doesn't my tiger doll close its eyes when we sleep?]
Our perception of the macroscopic world is so magic that children have to learn the difference between living and non-living things.

Goes along: if you could control your life multiple times to be perfect, you would eventually get tired of paradise, and you would go further and further into creating uncertain worlds with some suffering, until you would reach the current real world.

Very similar to \x[the-matrix-1999] when Agent Smith talks about the failed https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Paradise_Matrix[Paradise Matrix] shown at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qs3GlNZMhY[]:
\Q[Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered, where everyone would be happy? It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed that we lacked the programming language to describe your "perfect world". But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. So the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.]
