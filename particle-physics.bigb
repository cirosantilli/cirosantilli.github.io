As of 2019, the \x[standard-model] and \x[general-relativity] are incompatible. Once those are unified, we will have one equation to describe the entirety of \x[physics].

There are also however also unsolved problems in \x[electroweak-interaction] + \x[strong-interaction], which if achieved is referred to as a \x[grand-unified-theory]. Reaching a GUT is considered a sensible intermediate step before TOE.

The current state of Physics has been the result of several previous unifications as shown at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything#Conventional_sequence_of_theories so it is expected that this last missing unification is likely to happen one day, potentially conditional on humanity having enough energy to observe new phenomena.

= Defining properties of elementary particles
{parent=elementary-particle}

A suggested at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 3.9 "Elementary particles", it appears that in the \x[standard-model], the behaviour of each particle can be uniquely defined by the following five numbers:
* due to \x[spacetime-symmetry]{p}:
  * \x[mass]
  * \x[spin-physics]
* due to \x[internal-symmetry]{p}:
  * \x[electric-charge]
  * \x[weak-charge]
  * \x[color-charge]

E.g. for the \x[electron] we have:
* mass: $9.1 \times 10^{-31}$
* spin: 1/2
* electric charge: $1.6 \times 10^{-29}$
* weak charge: -1/2
* color charge: 0

Once you specify these properties, you could in theory just pluck them into the \x[standard-model-lagrangian] and you could simulate what happens. 

Setting new random values for those properties would also allow us to create new particles. It appears unknown why we only see the particles that we do, and \x[parameters-of-the-standard-model][why they have the values of properties they have].

= Photon
{parent=elementary-particle}
{wiki}

Initially light was though of as a wave because it experienced interference as shown by experiments such as:
* \x[double-slit-experiment]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_rings

But then, some key experiments also start suggesting that \x[light] is made up of \x[discrete] packets:
* \x[compton-scattering], also suggests that photons carry momentum
* \x[photoelectric-effect]
* \x[single-photon-production-and-detection-experiments]
and in the understanding of the 2020 \x[standard-model] the photon is one of the \x[elementary-particle]{p}{parent}.

This duality is fully described mathematically by \x[quantum-electrodynamics]{parent}, where the photon is modelled as a quantized excitation of the photon field.

{parent=speed-of-light}
{title2=FTL}
{wiki}

In \x[special-relativity], it is impossible to travel faster than light.

One argument of why, is that if you could travel faster than light, then you could send a message to a point in \x[spacetime] that is \x[spacelike-separated] from the present. But then since the target is spacelike separated, there exists a \x[inertial-frame-of-reference] in which that event happens before the present, which would be hard to make sense of.

Even worse, it would be possible to travel back in time:

Focal length

Each side is a sphere section. They don't have to have the same radius, they are still simple to understand with different radiuses.

The two things you have to have in mind that this does are:
* converges \x[parallel-light] to a point at center at distance $f$ known as the \x[focal-length].

  This is for example why you can use lenses to burn things with \x[sun] rays, which are basically parallel.

  Conversely, if the input is a \x[point-light-source] at the \x[focal-length], it gets converted into \x[parallel-light].
* image formation: it converges all rays coming from a given source point to a single point image. This amplifies the signal, and forms an image at a plane.

  The source image can be far away, and the virtual image can be close to the lens. This is exactly what we need for a camera.

  For each distance on one side, it only works for another distance on the other side. So when we set the distance between the lens and the detector, this sets the distance of the source object, i.e. the focus. The equation is:
  $$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_1} + \frac{1}{S_2}$$
  where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the two distances.

https://spie.org/publications/fg05_p03_maluss_law[]:
\Q[At the beginning of the nineteenth century the only known way to generate polarized light was with a calcite crystal. In 1808, using a calcite crystal, Malus discovered that natural incident light became polarized when it was reflected by a glass surface, and that the light reflected close to an angle of incidence of 57Â° could be extinguished when viewed through the crystal. He then proposed that natural light consisted of the s- and p-polarizations, which were perpendicular to each other.]

Initially there were mathematical reasons why people suspected that all \x[boson] needed to have 0 mass as is the case for \x[photon]{p} a \x[gluon]{p}, see \x[goldstone-s-theorem].

However, experiments showed that the \x[w-boson] and the \x[z-boson] both has large non-zero masses.

So people started theorizing some hack that would fix up the equations, and they came up with the \x[higgs-mechanism].

Others however soon proposed arguments why the \x[positron] would need to have the same \x[mass], and this idea had to be discarded.

= Parameters of the Standard Model
{parent=standard-model}

The growing number of parameters of the Standard Model is one big source of worry for early 21st century physics, much like the growing number of particles was a worry in the beginning of the 20th (but that one was solved by 2020).

= Why do symmetries such as SU(3), SU(2) and U(1) matter in particle physics?
{parent=standard-model}

\x[physicist]{c}{p} love to talk about that stuff, but no one ever has the guts to explain it into enough detail to show its beauty!!!

Perhaps the wisest thing is to just focus entirely on the \x[u-1] part to start with, which is the \x[quantum-electrodynamics] one, which is the simplest and most useful and historically first one to come around.

Perhaps the best explanation is that if you assume those \x[internal-symmetry]{p}, then you can systematically make "obvious" educated guesses at the interacting part of the \x[standard-model-lagrangian], which is the fundamental part of the \x[standard-model]. See e.g.:
* \x[derivation-of-the-quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian]
* \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 7 "Interaction Theory" derives all three of \x[quantum-electrodynamics], \x[weak-interaction] and \x[quantum-chromodynamics] Lagrangian from each of the symmetries!

One bit underlying reason is: \x[noether-s-theorem].

Notably, https://axelmaas.blogspot.com/2010/08/global-and-local-symmetries.html gives a good overview:
\Q[
A local symmetry transformation is much more complicated to visualize. Take a rectangular grid of the billiard balls from the last post, say ten times ten. Each ball is spherical symmetric, and thus invariant under a rotation. The system now has a global and a local symmetry. A global symmetry transformation would rotate each ball by the same amount in the same direction, leaving the system unchanged. A local symmetry transformation would rotate each ball about a different amount and around a different axis, still leaving the system to the eye unchanged. The system has also an additional global symmetry. Moving the whole grid to the left or to the right leaves the grid unchanged. However, no such local symmetry exists: Moving only one ball will destroy the grid's structure.

Such global and local symmetries play an important role in physics. The global symmetries are found to be associated with properties of particles, e. g., whether they are matter or antimatter, whether they carry electric charge, and so on. Local symmetries are found to be associated with forces. In fact, all the fundamental forces of nature are associated with very special local symmetries. For example, the weak force is actually associated in a very intricate way with local rotations of a four-dimensional sphere. The reason is that, invisible to the eye, everything charged under the weak force can be characterized by a arrow pointing from the center to the surface of such a four-dimensional sphere. This arrow can be rotated in a certain way and at every individual point, without changing anything which can be measured. It is thus a local symmetry. This will become more clearer over time, as at the moment of first encounter this appears to be very strange indeed.
]{id=quote-axelmaas-local-symmetry}
so it seems that that's why they are so key: \x[local-symmetry]{p} map to the forces themselves!!!

https://axelmaas.blogspot.com/2010/09/symmetries-of-standard-model.html then goes over all symmetries of the \x[standard-model] uber quickly, including the global ones.

= Maxwell's equations
{c}
{parent=particle-physics}
{wiki}

Unified all previous electro-magnetism theories into one equation.

Explains the propagation of light as a wave, and matches the previously known relationship between the \x[speed-of-light] and electromagnetic constants.

The equations are a limit case of the more complete \x[quantum-electrodynamics], and unlike that more general theory account for the quantization of \x[photon].

The equations are a system of \x[partial-differential-equation].

The system consists of 6 unknown functions that map 4 variables: time t and the x, y and z positions in space, to a real number:
* $E_x(t, x,y,z)$, $E_y(t, x,y,z)$, $E_z(t, x,y,z)$: directions of the electric field $\E : \R^4 \to \R^3$
* $B_x(t, x,y,z)$, $B_y(t, x,y,z)$, $B_z(t, x,y,z)$: directions of the magnetic field $\B : \R^4 \to \R^3$
and two known input functions:
* $\rho : \R^3\ to \R$: density of charges in space
* $\J : \R^3 \to \R^3$: current vector in space. This represents the strength of moving charges in space.

Due to the \x[conservation-of-charge] however, those input functions have the following restriction:
$$
\pdv{\rho}{t} + \div{\mathbf{\J}} = 0
$$
{title=Charge conservation}

Also consider the following cases:
* if a spherical charge is moving, then this of course means that $\rho$ is changing with time, and at the same time that a current exists
* in an \x[ideal] infinite cylindrical wire however, we can have constant $\rho$ in the wire, but there can still be a current because those charges are moving

  Such infinite cylindrical wire is of course an ideal case, but one which is a good approximation to the huge number of electrons that travel in a actual wire.

The goal of finding $\E$ and $\B$ is that those fields allow us to determine the force that gets applied to a charge via the \x[equation-lorentz-force], and then to find the force we just need to integrate over the entire body.

Finally, now that we have defined all terms involved in the Maxwell equations, let's see the equations:

$$
div{\E} = \frac{\rho}{\vacuumPermittivity}
$$
{title=Gauss' law}

$$
div{\B} = 0
$$
{title=Gauss's law for magnetism}

$$
\curl{\E} = -\pdv{\B}{t}
$$
{title=Faraday's law}

$$
\curl{\B} = \vacuumPermeability \left(\J + \vacuumPermittivity \pdv{E}{t} \right)
$$

You should also review the intuitive interpretation of \x[divergence] and \x[curl-mathematics].

= Explicit scalar form of the Maxwell's equations
{parent=maxwell-s-equations}

For numerical algorithms and to get a more low level understanding of the equations, we can expand all terms to the simpler and more explicit form:
$$
\pdv{E_x}{x} + \pdv{E_y}{x} +
\pdv{E_z}{x} =
\frac{\rho}{\vacuumPermittivity}
\\

\pdv{B_x}{x} +
\pdv{B_y}{x} +
\pdv{B_z}{x} =
0
\\

\pdv{E_z}{y} - \pdv{E_y}{z} = -\pdv{B_x}{t} \\
\pdv{E_x}{z} - \pdv{E_z}{x} = -\pdv{B_y}{t} \\
\pdv{E_y}{x} - \pdv{E_x}{y} = -\pdv{B_z}{t} \\

\pdv{B_z}{y} - \pdv{B_y}{z} = \vacuumPermeability \left(J_x + \vacuumPermittivity \pdv{E_x}{t} \right) \\
\pdv{B_x}{z} - \pdv{B_z}{x} = \vacuumPermeability \left(J_y + \vacuumPermittivity \pdv{E_y}{t} \right) \\
\pdv{B_y}{x} - \pdv{B_x}{y} = \vacuumPermeability \left(J_z + \vacuumPermittivity \pdv{E_z}{t} \right) \\
$$

= Overdetermination of Maxwell's equations
{parent=explicit-scalar-form-of-the-maxwell-s-equations}
{wiki=Maxwell's_equations#Overdetermination_of_Maxwell's_equations}

As seen from \x[explicit-scalar-form-of-the-maxwell-s-equations], this expands to 8 equations, so the question arises if the system is over-determined because it only has 6 functions to be determined.

As explained on the Wikipedia page  however, this is not the case, because if the first two equations hold for the initial condition, then the othe six equations imply that they also hold for all time, so they can be essentially omitted.

It is also worth noting that the first two equations don't involve time derivatives. Therefore, they can be seen as spacial constraints.

TODO: the \x[electric-field] and \x[magnetic-field] can be expressed in terms of the \x[electric-potential] and \x[magnetic-vector-potential]. So then we only need 4 variables?

Explains how it is possible \x[invariance-of-the-speed-of-light][that everyone observes the same speed of light, even if they are moving towards or opposite to the light]!!!

This was first best observed by the \x[michelson-morley-experiment], which uses the movement of the Earth at different times of the year to try and detect differences in the speed of light.

This leads leads to the following conclusions:
* to \x[length-contraction] and time dilation
* the speed of light is the maximum speed anything can reach

All of this goes of course completely against our daily Physics intuition.

The "special" in the name refers to the fact that it is a superset of \x[general-relativity], which also explains gravity in a single framework.

Since time and space get all messed up together, you have to be very careful to understand what it means to say "I observed this to happen over there at that time", otherwise you will go crazy. A good way to think about is this:
* use \x[einstein-synchronization] to setup a bunch of clocks for every position in your \x[frame-of-reference]
* on every point of space, you put a little detector which records events and the time of the event
* each detector can only detect events locally, i.e. events that happen very close to the detector
* then, after the event, the detectors can send a signal to you, who is sitting at the origin, telling you what they detected

The equation that allows us to calculate stuff in \x[special-relativity]!

Take two observers with identical rules and stopwatch, and aligned axes, but one is on a car moving at towards the $+x$ direction at speed $v$.

TODO image.

When both observe an event, if we denote:
* $(t, x, y, z)$ the observation of the standing observer
* $(t', x', y', z')$ the observation of the ending observer on a car
It is of course arbitrary who is standing and who is moving, we will just use the term "standing" for the one without primes.

Then the coordinates of the event observed by the observer on the car are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t' & = \gamma \left( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right) \\
x' & = \gamma \left( x - v t \right) \\
y' & = y \\
z' & = z
\end{aligned}
$$
where:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}
$$

Note that if $\frac{v}{c}$ tends towards zero, then this reduces to the usual \x[galilean-transformation]{p} which our intuition expects:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t' & = t
x' & = x - v t \\
y' & = y \\
z' & = z
\end{aligned}
$$

This explains why we don't observe special relativity in our daily lives: macroscopic objects move too slowly compared to light, and $\frac{v}{c}$ is almost zero.

= Lorentz covariance
{c}
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

= Lorentz covariant
{c}
{synonym}

Same motivation as \x[galilean-invariance], but \x[relativistic] version of that: we want the laws of physics to have the same form on all inertial frames, so we really want to write them in a way that is Lorentz covariant.

This is just the relativistic version of that which takes the \x[lorentz-transformation] into account instead of just the old \x[galilean-transformation].

{synonym}

Basically a synonym of \x[lorentz-covariance]?

= Lorentz transform consequence: everyone sees the same speed of light
{c}
{parent=lorentz-transformation}

OK, so let's verify the main desired consequence of the \x[lorentz-transformation]: that everyone observes the same \x[speed-of-light].

Observers will measure the speed of light by calculating how long it takes the light going towards $+x$ cross a rod of length $L = x_2 - x_1$ laid in the x axis at position $X1$.

TODO image.

Each observer will observe two events:
* $(t_1, x_1, y_1, z_1)$: the light touches the left side of the rod
* $(t_2, x_2, y_2, z_2)$: the light touches the right side of the rod

Supposing that the standing observer measures the speed of light as $c$ and that light hits the left side of the rod at time $T1$, then he observes the coordinates:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t_1 & = T1 \\
x_1 & = X1 \\
t_2 & = \frac{L}{c} \\
x_2 & = X1 + L \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, if we transform for the moving observer:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t_1' & = \gamma \left( t_1 - \frac{v x_1}{c^2} \right) \\
x_1' & = \gamma \left( x_1 - v t_1             \right) \\
t_2' & = \gamma \left( t_2 - \frac{v x_2}{c^2} \right) \\
x_2' & = \gamma \left( x_2 - v t_2             \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
and so the moving observer measures the speed of light as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
c' & = \frac{x_2' - x_1'}{t_2' - t_1'} \\
   & = \frac{(x_2 - v t_2) - (x_1 - v t_1)}{(t_2 - \frac{v x_2}{c^2}) - (t_1 - \frac{v x_1}{c^2})} \\
   & = \frac{(x_2 - x_1) - v (t_2 - t_1)}{(t_2 - t_1) - \frac{v}{c^2} (x_2 - x_1)} \\
   & = \frac{\frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1} - v}{1 - \frac{v}{c^2} \frac{x_2 -x_1}{t_2 - t_1}} \\
   & = \frac{c - v}{1 - \frac{v}{c^2} c} \\
   & = \frac{c - v}{\frac{c - v}{c}} \\
   & = c \\
\end{aligned}
$$

= Length contraction
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

Suppose that a rod has is length $L$ measured on a rest frame $S$ (or maybe even better: two identical rulers were manufactured, and one is taken on a spaceship, a bit like the \x[twin-paradox]).

Question: what is the length $L'$ than an observer in frame $S'$ moving relative to $S$ as speed $v$ observe the rod to be?

The key idea is that there are two events to consider in each frame, which we call 1 and 2:
* the left end of the rod is an observation event at a given position at a given time: $x_1$ and $t_1$ for $S$ or $x'_1$ and $t'_1$ for $S'$
* the right end of the rod is an observation event at a given position at a given time : $x_2$ and $t_2$ for $S$ or $x'_2$ and $t'_2$ for $S'$
Note that what you visually observe on a photograph is a different measurement to the more precise/easy to calculate two event measurement. On a photograph, it seems you might not even see the contraction in some cases as mentioned at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotation

Measuring a length means to measure the $x_2 - x_1$ difference for a single point in time in your frame ($t2 = t1$).

So what we want to obtain is $x'_2 - x'_1$ for any given time $t'2 = t'1$.

In summary, we have:
$$
\begin{aligned}
L  &= x_2  &- x_1 \\
L' &= x'_2 &- x'_1
t'_2 = t'_1
\end{aligned}
$$

By plugging those values into the \x[lorentz-transformation], we can eliminate $t_2 and t_1$, and conclude that for any $t'_2 = t'_1$, the length contraction relation holds:
$$
L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}
$$

The key question that needs intuitive clarification then is: but how can this be symmetric? How can both observers see each other's rulers shrink?

And the key answer is: because to the second observer, the measurements made by the first observer are not simultaneous. Notably, the two measurement events are obviously \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p} by looking at the \x[light-cone], and therefore can be measured even in different orders by different observers.

What you would see the moving rod look like on a photo of a \x[length-contraction] experiment, as opposed as using two locally measured separate spacetime events to measure its length.

= Time dilation
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

One of the best ways to think about it is the \x[transversal-time-dilation] thought experiment.

= Transversal time dilation
{parent=time-dilation}
{wiki=Time_dilation#Simple_inference_of_velocity_time_dilation}

Light watch transverse to direction of motion. This case is interesting because it separates \x[length-contraction] from \x[time-dilation] completely.

Of course, as usual in \x[special-relativity], calling something "time dilation" leads us to \x[mind-boggling] ideas of "symmetry breaking": if both frames have a light watch, how can both possibly observe the other to be time dilated?

And the answer to this, is the usual: in special relativity time and space are interwoven in a \x[fucked] up way, everything is just a spacetime event.

In this case, there are three spacetime events of interest: both clocks start at same position, your beam hits up at x=0, moving frame hits up at x>0.

Those two mentioned events are \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p}, and therefore even though they seem simultaneous to you, they are not going to be simultaneous to the moving observer!

If \x[einstein-synchronization][little clock one meter away from you] tells you that at the time of some event (your light beam hit up) the moving light watch was only 50% up, this is just a number given by your one meter away watch!

= Transverse Doppler effect
{parent=time-dilation}
{wiki=Relativistic_Doppler_effect#Transverse_Doppler_effect}

= Twin paradox
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

The key question is: why is this not symmetrical?

One answer is: because one of the twin accelerates, and therefore changes inertial frames.

But the better answer is: understand what happens when the stationary twin sends light signals at constant time intervals to each other. When does the travelling twin receives them?

By doing that, we see that "all the extra aging happens immediately when the twin turns around":
* on the out trip, both twins receive signals at constant intervals
* when the moving twin turns around and starts to accelerate through different inertial frames, shit happens:
  * the moving twin suddenly notices that the rate of signals from the stationary twin increased. They are getting older faster than us!
  * the stationary twin suddenly notices that the rate of signals from the moving twin decreased. They are getting older slower than us!
* then when the moving twin reaches the return velocity, both see constant signal rates once again

\Image[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/TwinParadoxProperAcceleration.svg]
{title=\x[twin-paradox]{c} illustration with twins sending light signals at regular intervals.}
{height=600}

Another way of understanding it is: you have to make all calculations on a \i[single] inertial frame for the entire trip.

Supposing the sibling quickly accelerates out (or magically starts moving at constant speed), travels at constant speed, and quickly accelerates back, and travels at constant speed setup, there are three frames that seem reasonable:
* the frame of the non-accelerating sibling
* the outgoing trip of the accelerating sibling
* the return trip of the accelerating sibling

If you do that, all three calculations give the exact same result, which is reassuring.

Another way to understand it is to do explicit integrations of the acceleration: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/242043/what-is-the-proper-way-to-explain-the-twin-paradox/242044#242044 This is the least insightful however :-)

The following aspects of \x[maxwell-s-equations] make no sense without \x[special-relativity]:

* \x[maxwell-s-equations-imply-that-the-speed-of-light-is-the-same-for-all-inertial-reference-frames]

When charged particle though experiment are seen from the point of view of special relativity, it becomes clear that magnetism is just a direct side effect of charges being viewed in special relativity.

= Charged particle moving at the same speed of electrons thought experiment
{synonym}
{title2}

This is a well known though experiment, which \x[richard-feynman] used to emphasize
* infinite wire with balanced positive and negative charges, so no net charge, but a net magnetic field
* a single charge moves parallel to wire at the same speed as the electrons

In the above experiment:
* from the wire frame, the charge feels electromagnetic force, because it is moving and there is a magnetic field
* from the single charge frame, there is still magnetic field (positive charges are moving), but the body itself is not moving, so there is no force!

The solution to this problem is \x[length-contraction]: the positive charges are length contracted and the moving electrons aren't, and therefore they are denser and therefore there is an effective charge from that frame.

Why should I care when I can calculate new x and new time with \x[lorentz-transformation]?

Answer: it can give some qualitative intuition on what is larger/smaller happens before/after based only on arguably more intuitive geometric considerations, without requiring you to do any calculations, see e.g. \x[image-spacetime-diagram-illustrating-how-faster-than-light-travel-implies-time-travel].

= Light cone
{parent=spacetime-diagram}
{wiki}

A subset of \x[spacetime-diagram].

The key insights that it gives are:
* future and past are well defined: every reference frame sees your future in your future cone, and your past in your past cone

  Otherwise causality could be violated, and then things would go really bad, you could tell your past self to tell your past self to tell your past self to do something.

  You can only affect the outcome of events in your future cone, and you can only be affected by events in your past cone. You can't travel fast enough to affect.

  Two spacetime events with such fixed causality are called \x[timelike-separated-event]{p}.
* every other event (to right and left, known as \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p}) can be measured to happen before or after your current spacetime event by different observers.

  But that does not violate causality, because you just can't reach those spacetime points anyways to affect them.

However, in \x[special-relativity], neither of those are invariant separately, since space and time are mixed up together.

Instead, there is a new unified invariant: the spacetime-interval, given by:

Wiki mentions that alpha decay is well modelled as a \x[quantum-tunnelling] event, see also \x[geiger-nuttall-law].

As a result of that law, alpha particles have relatively little energy variation around 5 MeV or a speed of about 5% of the \x[speed-of-light] for any element, because the energy is inversely exponentially proportional to \x[half-life]. This is because:
* if the energy is much larger, decay is very fast and we don't have time to study the \x[isotope]
* if the energy is much smaller, decay is very rare and we don't have enough events to observe at all

\x[uranium]{c} emits them, you can see their mass to charge ratio under magnetic field and so deduce that they are \x[electron]{p}.

Caused by \x[weak-interaction] TODO why/how.

The emitted electron kinetic energy is random from zero to a maximum value. The rest goes into a \x[neutrino]. This is how the neutrino was first discovered/observed indirectly. This is well illustrated in a \x[decay-scheme] such as \x[image-caesium-137-decay-scheme].

= Gamma ray
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

Most commonly known as a byproduct \x[radioactive-decay].

A \x[decay-scheme] such as \x[image-caesium-137-decay-scheme] illustrates well how gamma radiation happens as a byproduct of \x[radioactive-decay] due to the existence of \x[nuclear-isomer].

Gamma rays are pretty cool as they give us insight into the energy levels/different configurations of the nucleus.

They have also been used as early sources of high energy particles for \x[particle-physics] experiments before the development of \x[particle-accelerator]{p}, serving a similar purpose to \x[cosmic-ray]{p} in those early days.

But \x[gamma-ray]{p} they were more convenient in some cases because you could more easily manage them inside a \x[laboratory] rather than have to go climb some bloody mountain or a \x[balloon].

The \x[positron] for example was first observed on \x[cosmic-ray]{p}, but better confirmed in \x[gamma-ray] experiments by \x[carl-david-anderson].

= Half-life
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

The \x[half-life] of \x[radioactive-decay], which as discovered a few years before \x[quantum-mechanics] was discovered and matured, was a major mystery. Why do some nuclei fission in apparently random fashion, while others don't? How is the state of different nuclei different from one another? This is mentioned in \x[inward-bound-by-abraham-pais-1988] Chapter 6.e Why a half-life?

The term also sees use in other areas, notably \x[biology], where e.g. \x[rna]{p} spontaneously decay as part of the \x[cell]'s \x[control-system], see e.g. mentions in \x[e-coli-whole-cell-model-by-covert-lab].

This is a good book, it gives a summary of biographies, and a reasonable description of the main ideas, with many illustrations. Each subject is not presented in incredible detail, but it is a good overview of events.

The book unfortunately does not cover the history of \x[quantum-mechanics] very, the author specifically says that this will not be covered, the focus is more on particles/forces. But there are still some mentions.

Unfortunately the channel is too obsessed with mathematical detail (which it does amazingly), and does not give enough examples/application/intuition, which is what would be useful to most people, thus falling too much on the hardcore side of \x[the-missing-link-between-basic-and-advanced].

This channel does have on merit however: compared to other university courses, it is much more direct, which might mean that you get to something interesting before you got bored to death, \x[you-can-learn-more-from-older-students-than-from-faculty]{full} comes to mind.

Videos generally involves short talks + a detailed read-through of a pre-prepared \x[pdf]. Dietterich has refused however giving the PDF or \x[latex] source as of 2020 on comments unfortunately... what a \x[open-educational-resources][wasted opportunity] for society. TODO find the comment.

These videos can give some geometric insight and do have their value.

But they are sometimes too slow, \x[how-to-teach-and-learn-physics][there are never any mention of experiments, just "the truth"].

And when things get "\x[mathy]", it sticks to a more qualitative view which may not be enough.

Very over the top with \x[sexy] demons and angels making appearances, and has some classic aesthetic artistic value :-)
