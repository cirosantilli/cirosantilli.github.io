= Radioactive
{synonym}

\x[ciro-santilli] finds it interesting that radioactive decay basically kickstarted the domain of \x[nuclear-physics] by essentially providing a natural \x[particle-accelerator] from a chunk of radioactive element.

The discovery process was particularly interesting, including \x[henri-becquerel]'s luck while observing \x[phosphorescence], and \x[marie-curie]'s observation that the \x[uranium] \x[ore] were more radioactive than pure uranium, and must therefore contain other even more radioactive substances, which lead to the discovery of \x[polonium] (\x[half-life] 138 days) and \x[radium] (half-life 1600 years).

= Alpha decay
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

Most of the \x[helium] in the Earth's atmosphere comes from alpha decay, since helium is lighter than air and naturally escapes out out of the atmosphere.

Wiki mentions that alpha decay is well modelled as a \x[quantum-tunnelling] event, see also \x[geiger-nuttall-law].

As a result of that law, alpha particles have relatively little energy variation around 5 MeV or a speed of about 5% of the \x[speed-of-light] for any element, because the energy is inversely exponentially proportional to \x[half-life]. This is because:
* if the energy is much larger, decay is very fast and we don't have time to study the \x[isotope]
* if the energy is much smaller, decay is very rare and we don't have enough events to observe at all

{wiki}

\x[uranium]{c} emits them, you can see their mass to charge ratio under magnetic field and so deduce that they are \x[electron]{p}.

Caused by \x[weak-interaction] TODO why/how.

The emitted electron kinetic energy is random from zero to a maximum value. The rest goes into a \x[neutrino]. This is how the neutrino was first discovered/observed indirectly. This is well illustrated in a \x[decay-scheme] such as \x[image-caesium-137-decay-scheme].

= Gamma ray
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

Most commonly known as a byproduct \x[radioactive-decay].

A \x[decay-scheme] such as \x[image-caesium-137-decay-scheme] illustrates well how gamma radiation happens as a byproduct of \x[radioactive-decay] due to the existence of \x[nuclear-isomer].

Gamma rays are pretty cool as they give us insight into the energy levels/different configurations of the nucleus.

They have also been used as early sources of high energy particles for \x[particle-physics] experiments before the development of \x[particle-accelerator]{p}, serving a similar purpose to \x[cosmic-ray]{p} in those early days.

But \x[gamma-ray]{p} they were more convenient in some cases because you could more easily manage them inside a \x[laboratory] rather than have to go climb some bloody mountain or a \x[balloon].

The \x[positron] for example was first observed on \x[cosmic-ray]{p}, but better confirmed in \x[gamma-ray] experiments by \x[carl-david-anderson].

= Half-life
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

The \x[half-life] of \x[radioactive-decay], which as discovered a few years before \x[quantum-mechanics] was discovered and matured, was a major mystery. Why do some nuclei fission in apparently random fashion, while others don't? How is the state of different nuclei different from one another? This is mentioned in \x[inward-bound-by-abraham-pais-1988] Chapter 6.e Why a half-life?

The term also sees use in other areas, notably \x[biology], where e.g. \x[rna]{p} spontaneously decay as part of the \x[cell]'s \x[control-system], see e.g. mentions in \x[e-coli-whole-cell-model-by-covert-lab].

Unfortunately the channel is too obsessed with mathematical detail (which it does amazingly), and does not give enough examples/application/intuition, which is what would be useful to most people, thus falling too much on the hardcore side of \x[the-missing-link-between-basic-and-advanced].

This channel does have on merit however: compared to other university courses, it is much more direct, which might mean that you get to something interesting before you got bored to death, \x[you-can-learn-more-from-older-students-than-from-faculty]{full} comes to mind.

Videos generally involves short talks + a detailed read-through of a pre-prepared \x[pdf]. Dietterich has refused however giving the PDF or \x[latex] source as of 2020 on comments unfortunately... what a \x[open-educational-resources][wasted opportunity] for society. TODO find the comment.

These videos can give some geometric insight and do have their value.

And when things get "\x[mathy]", it sticks to a more qualitative view which may not be enough.

Very over the top with \x[sexy] demons and angels making appearances, and has some classic aesthetic artistic value :-)
