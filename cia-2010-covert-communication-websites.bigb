This article is about <cutout (espionage)>[covert agent communication channel] websites used by the <CIA> in many countries from the late 2000s until the early 2010s, when they were uncovered by <counter intelligence> of the targeted countries circa 2011-2013. This discovery led to the imprisonment and execution of several assets in <Iran> and <China>, and subsequent shutdown of the channel.

{title=How I found a <Star Wars> website made by the <CIA> by <Ciro Santilli>}
{description=Slightly edited VOD of the talk <Aratu Week 2024 Talk by Ciro Santilli>.}
{height=600}

The existence of such websites was first reported in November 2018 by Yahoo News: https://www.yahoo.com/video/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html[].

Previous whispers had been heard in 2017 but without clear mention of websites: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/world/asia/china-cia-spies-espionage.html[]:
> Some were convinced that a mole within the C.I.A. had betrayed the United States. Others believed that the Chinese had hacked the covert system the C.I.A. used to communicate with its foreign sources. Years later, that debate remains unresolved.

  \[...\]

  From the final weeks of 2010 through the end of 2012, \[...\] the Chinese killed at least a dozen of the <CIA>[C.I.A.]’s sources. \[...\] One was shot in front of his colleagues in the courtyard of a government building — a message to others who might have been working for the C.I.A.

Most notably, starting in 2008, CIA contractor John Reidy started raising concerns about the security of the communication systems used, but he was silenced and ignored, leading to catastrophe.https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2022/10/18/the-cias-hypocrisy-on-sources-and-methods/{ref}https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=004be77e-70ef-414e-aac2-c431a2962844{ref}

Then in September 2022 a few specific websites were finally reported by Reuters: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran/[], henceforth known only as "the <Reuters article>" in this article.

<Ciro Santilli> heard about the 2018 article at around 2020 while <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[studying for his China campaign] because the websites had been used to take down the Chinese CIA network in China. He even asked on <Quora>: https://www.quora.com/What-were-some-examples-of-the-websites-that-the-CIA-used-around-2010-as-a-communication-mechanism-for-its-spies-in-China-and-Iran-but-were-later-found-and-used-to-take-down-their-spy-networks[] but there were no publicly known domains at the time to serve as a starting point. https://www.quora.com/profile/Chris-2110[Chris, Electrical Engineer and former Avionics Tech in the US Navy], even replied suggesting that obviously the <CIA> is so competent that it would never ever have its sites leaked like that:
> Seriously a dumb question.

So when <Ciro Santilli> heard about the 2022 article almost a year after publication, and being a <OurBigBook.com>[half-arsed web developer himself], he <Ciro Santilli's naughty projects>[knew he had to try] and find some of the domains himself using the newly available information! It was an irresistible real-life <capture the flag (cybersecurity)>. The thing is, everyone who has ever developed a website knows that its <attack surface> is about the <Size of Texas meme>[size of Texas], and the potential for <fingerprinting (cybersecurity)> is off the charts with so many bits and pieces sticking out. Chris, get fucked.

In particular, it is fun to have such a clear and visible to anyone examples of the <USA spying on its own allies> in the form of <Wayback Machine> archives.

Given that it was reported that there were "more than 350" such websites, it would be really cool if we could uncover more of those websites ourselves beyond the 9 domains reported by Reuters!

This article documents the list of extremely likely candidates Ciro has found so far, mostly using:
* rudimentary IP range search on https://viewdns.info[] starting from the websites reported by Reuters
* heuristic search for keywords in domains of the  <2013 DNS Census> plus <Wayback Machine CDX scanning>
more details on methods also follow. It is still far from the https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/[885 websites reported by citizenlabs], so there must be key techniques missing. But the fact that there are no <Google Search> hits for the domains or IPs (except in bulk e.g. in <expired domain trackers>) indicates that these might not have been previously clearly publicly disclosed.

If anyone can find others, or has better techniques: <contact>{full}. The techniques used so far have been very heuristic, and that added to the limited amount of data makes it almost certain that several <IP range search>[IP ranges] have been missed. There are two types of contributions that would be possible:
* finding new IP ranges: harder more exiting, and potentially requires more intelligence
* better IP to domain name databases to <Find missing hits in IP ranges>[fill in known gaps in existing IP ranges]
Perhaps the current heuristically obtained data can serve as a good starting for a more data-oriented search that will eventually find a valuable fingerprint which brings the entire network out.

Disclaimer: the network fell in 2013, followed by fully public disclosures in 2018 and 2022, so we believe it is now more than safe for the public to know what can still be uncovered about the events that took place. The main author's political bias is <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[strongly pro-democracy and anti-dictatorship].

May this list serve as a tribute to those who spent their days making, using, and uncovering these websites under the shadows.

If you want to go into one of the best <OSINT> <capture the flag (cybersecurity)>[CTFs] of your life, stop reading now and see how many Web Archives you can find starting only from the <Reuters article> as Ciro did. Some guidelines:
* there was no ultra-clean fingerprint found yet. Some intuitive and somewhat guessy data analysis was needed. But when you clean the data correctly and make good guesses, many hits follow, it feels so good
* nothing was paid for data. But using cybercafe <Wifi>'s for a few extra IPs may help.

{description=
The <Star Wars> one. Clearly branded websites like this are rare, which makes finding them all the much more fun. The <Reuters article> had two of them (<Searching for Carson>[Carson] and rastadirect.net), so these were probably manually selected from the full hit dataset, and did not serve specifically as entry points. Most of the websites are quite boring and forgetful as you'd expect.

The subtitle "Beyond The Unknown" may be a reference to the https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_Regions[Unknown Regions], an unexplored area of the galaxy in the Star Wars fictional universe.

{description=
The photo can still be licensed today as of 2025: https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/photo/little-jedi-royalty-free-image/172984439[]. We found it by https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/search/2/image?phrase=jedi%20boy&sort=best&license=rf%2Crm[searching for "jedi boy" on gettyimages.co.uk]. The photo is credited to a `madisonwi`, presumably an alias based on the location <#Madison, Wisconsin>. Here's a random website about adoption that uses it: https://www.adoptionadvocates.net/star-wars-adoption-language/ and where it can be seen without the watermarks.

The droids can be seen e.g. at: https://www.amazon.co.uk/04-Kampf-Droiden-Superheftig-Jedi/dp/B004TINSW6[], a promotional material for a 2008 The Clone Wars television series audio CD and available as transparent PNGs without background in several sources. The Yoda art also seems to come from that show: https://rpggamer.org/page.php?page=4229[]. The contractor's children were likely watching it when they had the idea.

* 2021 https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-security-agency-spied-merkel-other-top-european-officials-through-danish-2021-05-30/ U.S. spied on Merkel and other Europeans through Danish cables

Being <Brazilian>, <Ciro Santilli> is particularly curious about the existence of a Brazilian-focused website one mentioned in the article, as well as in other <democracies>.

WTF the <CIA> was doing in Brazil in the early 2010s! Wasn't helping to install the <Military dictatorship in Brazil> enough!

It is worth noting that democracies represent just a small minority of the websites found. The Middle East, and Spanish language sites (presumably for Venezuela + war on drugs countries?) where the huge majority. But <Americans> have to understand that https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/dictatorships-tend-to-work-together[democracies have to work together and build mutual trust, and not spy on one another]. Even some of the enlightened people from <Hacker News> seem https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36279768[to not grasp this point]. The <USA> cannot single handedly maintain world order as it once could. Collaboration based on trust is the only way.

<Snowden>'s 2013 revelations particularly shocked USA allies with the fact that they were being spied upon, and as of the 2020's, everybody knows this and has "stopped caring", and or moved to <end-to-end encryption> by default. This is beautifully illustrated in the <Snowden (film)> when Snowden talks about his time in <Japan> working for <Dell> as an undercover <NSA> operative:
> <NSA> wanted to impress the <Japanese>. Show them our reach. They loved the live video from drones. This is <Pakistan> right now \[video shows CIA agents demonstrating drone footage to Japanese officials\]. They were not as excited about that we wanted their help to spy on the Japanese population. They said it was against their laws.

  We bugged the country anyway, of course.

  And we did not stop there. Once we had their communications we continued with the physical infrastructure. We sneaked into small programs in their power grids, dams, hospitals. The idea was that if Japan one day was not our allies we could turn off the lights.

  And it was not just Japan. We planted software in <Mexico>, <Germany>, <Brazil>, Austria.

  <China>, I can understand. Or <Russia> or <Iran>. Venezuela, okay.

  But Austria? \[shows footage of <cow> on an idyllic <Alpine> mountain grazing field, suggesting that there is nothing in Austria to spy on\]

Another noteworthy scene from that movie is <video Aptitude test scene from the Snowden 2016 film>, where a bunch of new <CIA> recruits are told that:
> Each of you is going to build a covert communications network in your home city \[i.e. their fictitious foreign target location written on each person's desk, not necessarily where they were actually born\], you're going to deploy it, backup your site, destroy it, and restore it again.

Hit criteria: has <Wayback Machine> archive, and clear indication of a known <communication mechanism>. The mechanism itself doesn't need to be archived however, a link to it is enough given other supporting elements: IP range, site style, date, web archive date pattern. JS commons are always quickly visually inspected, other mechanisms we look only at filename patterns. Commented edge cases that didn't make the cut can be found mostly under <IP range search>{full} and <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup heuristic keyword searches>{full}.

Features Johnny Carson, Charles Chaplin, Rowan Atkins, The Three Stooges and some other <Americans> no one knows about anymore. There must have been a massive Johnny Carson amongst the contractors at that time given `alljohnny.com`! The HTML page is weirdly titled `pg1c`.

= Gathering key points from the articles
{parent=Methodology}

https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/[] did an investigation and found 885 such websites, but decided not to disclose the list or methods:
> Using only a single website, as well as publicly available material such as historical internet scanning results and the <Internet Archive>'s <Wayback Machine>, we identified a network of 885 websites and have high confidence that the United States (US) Central Intelligence Agency (<CIA>) used these sites for covert communication.

  The websites included similar <Java>, <JavaScript>, <Adobe Flash>, and <CGI> artifacts that implemented or apparently loaded covert communications apps. In addition, blocks of sequential IP addresses registered to apparently fictitious US companies were used to host some of the websites. All of these flaws would have facilitated discovery by hostile parties.

  The websites, which purported to be news, weather, sports, healthcare, and other legitimate websites, appeared to be localized to at least 29 languages and geared towards at least 36 countries.
The question is which website. E.g. at https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/ they used data from Censys.
> We searched historical data from Censys
https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/ mentions https://scans.io/[]. https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/running-in-circles-uncovering-the-clients-of-cyberespionage-firm-circles/ mentions: https://www.shodan.io/[], Censys really seems to be their thing.

Another critical excerpt is:
> The bulk of the websites that we discovered were active at various periods between 2004 and 2013. We do not believe that the CIA has recently used this communications infrastructure. Nevertheless, a subset of the websites are linked to individuals who may be former and possibly still active intelligence community employees or assets:
  * Several are currently abroad
  * Another left mainland China in the time frame of the Chinese crackdown
  * Another was subsequently employed by the US State Department
  * Another now works at a foreign intelligence contractor
  Given that we cannot rule out ongoing risks to CIA employees or assets, we are not publishing full technical details regarding our process of mapping out the network at this time. As a first step, we intend to conduct a limited disclosure to <US Government> oversight bodies.
This basically implies that they must have found some communication layer level identifier, e.g. <IP> registration, <domain name> registration, or certificate because it is impossible to believe that real agent names would have been present on the website content itself!

The websites were used from at least as early as August 2008, as per Gholamreza Hosseini's account, and the system was only shutdown in 2013 apparently. https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/ however claims that they were used since as early as 2004.

Notably, so as to be less suspicious the websites are often in the language of the country for which they were intended, so we can often guess which country they were intended for!

The <Reuters article> directly reported only two domains in writing:
* http://iraniangoals.com[]. Iranian language <football> website. As of 2023, the domain had been bought by Reuters and redirects to their website.

But by looking at the URLs of the screenshots they provided from other websites we can easily uncover all others that had screenshots, <Searching for Carson>[except for the Johnny Carson one], which is just generically named. E.g. the image for the Chinese one is https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/usa-spies-iran/screencap-activegaminginfo.com.jpg?v=192516290922 which leads us to domain http://activegaminginfo.com[].

Also none of those extra ones have any <Google> hits except for huge domain dumps such has <Expired domain trackers>, so maybe this counts as little bit of novel public research.

The full list of domains from screenshots is:

= Fingerprints
{parent=Methodology}

= Fingerprint
{synonym}

From <The Reuters websites> and others we've found, we can establish see some clear stylistic trends across the websites which would allow us to find other likely candidates upon inspection:
* natural sounding, sometimes long-ish, <domain names> generally with 2 or 3 full words. Most in English language, but a few in Spanish, and very few in other languages like French.
* shallow websites with a few tabs, many external links, sometimes many images, and few internal pages
* lots of rectangular images make up the top bar banner image. Stock images are often used to make the full image, and then the full image is split. An example
  * http://classicalmusicboxonline.com/images/banner_01.jpg
  * http://classicalmusicboxonline.com/images/banner_02.jpg
  * ...
  * http://classicalmusicboxonline.com/images/banner_19.jpg
  * http://classicalmusicboxonline.com/images/banner_20.jpg
* common themes include:
  * news
  * hobbies, notably sports, travel and <photography>. Golf seems overrepresented. Must be a thing over there in Langley.
* .com and .net <top-level domains>, plus a few other very rare <non .com .net TLDs>, notably .info and .org
* each one has one "communication mechanism file": <communication mechanisms>
* narrow page width like in the days of old, lots of images
* each hit domain is the only domain for its IP, i.e. the websites are all private hosted, no https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service[shared web hosting service] examples have been found so far
* split images images: many of the website banners are composed of several images cut up. Stock images were first assembled into the banner, and then the resulting image was cut. Possibly this was done to make reverse image search to their stock image provider harder. But it somewhat backfired and serves as a good marker that confirms authorship. Maybe it is some kind of outdated web design thing, which they took much further in time than the average website, like the JAR. Their websites do appear to follow common style guidelines form earlier eras, around the early 2000s notably, some legit sites that look a lot like hits:
  * https://web.archive.org/web/20031002010827/http://www.ausiranstudy.com/
* some common pattern they follow in their news lists:
  * `ul.rss-items > li.rss-item`, e.g.: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202092126/http://beamingnews.com/
  * links with class `a.newslink` and `a.newslinkalt` e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20110128181622/http://profile-news.com/
The most notable dissonance from the rest of the web is that there are no commercial looking website of companies, presumably because it was felt that it would be possible to verify the existence of such companies.

It would be fun to actually reverse search into one of their stock image provider's original images. Ones we've found:
* https://web.archive.org/web/20110207201846/http://totallynewsnow.com/
  * https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/news-gm101581053-7410445

  * https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/photo/little-jedi-royalty-free-image/172984439[]

= IP range search
{parent=Methodology}

One promising way to find more of those would be with <IP> searches, since it was stated in the <Reuters article> that the <CIA> made the terrible mistake of using several contiguous IP blocks for those website. What a phenomenal <OPSEC> failure!!!

The easiest way would be if <Wayback Machine> itself had an IP search function, but we couldn't find one: <Search Wayback Machine by IP>.

https://viewdns.info was the first easily accessible website that <Ciro Santilli> could find that contained such information.

Our current results indicate that the typical IP range is about 30 IPs wide.

E.g. searching: https://viewdns.info/iphistory[] and considering only hits from 2011 or earlier we obtain:
* capture-nature.com
  * 65.61.127.163 - Greenacres - United States - TierPoint - 2013-10-19
* activegaminginfo.com
  * 66.175.106.148 - United States - Verizon Business - 2012-03-03
* iraniangoals.com
  * 68.178.232.100 - United States - GoDaddy.com - 2011-11-13
  * 69.65.33.21 - Flushing - United States - GigeNET - 2011-09-08
* rastadirect.net
  * 68.178.232.100 - United States - GoDaddy.com - 2011-05-02
* iraniangoalkicks.com
  * 68.178.232.100 - United States - GoDaddy.com - 2011-04-04
* headlines2day.com
  * 118.139.174.1 - Singapore - Web Hosting Service - 2013-06-30. Source: viewdns.info
  * 184.168.221.91 2013-08-12T06:17:39. Source: <2013 DNS Census> grep
* fightwithoutrules.com
  * 204.11.56.25 - British Virgin Islands - Confluence Networks Inc - 2013-09-26
  * 208.91.197.19 - British Virgin Islands - Confluence Networks Inc - 2013-05-20
  * 212.4.17.38 - Milan - Italy - MCI Worldcom Italy Spa - 2012-03-03
* fitness-dawg.com
  * 219.90.62.243 - Taiwan - Verizon Taiwan Co. Limited - 2012-01-11

Neither of these seem to be in the same ranges, the only common nearby hit amongst these ranges is the exact `68.178.232.100`, and doing reverse IP search at https://viewdns.info/reverseip/?host=68.178.232.100&t=1 states that it has 2.5 million hostnames associated to it, so it must be some kind of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service[Shared web hosting service], see also: https://superuser.com/questions/577070/is-it-possible-for-many-domain-names-to-share-one-ip-address[], which makes search hard.

Ciro then tried some of the other IPs, and soon hit gold.

Initially, Ciro started by doing manual queries to viewdns.info/reversip until his IP was blocked. Then he created an account and used his 250 free queries with the following helper script: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh]. The output of that script can be seen at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh[].

Ciro then found <2013 DNS Census> which contained data highly disjoint form the viewdns-info one!

Summaries of the IP range exploration done so far follows, combined data from all databases above.

= Hits without nearby IP hits
{parent=IP range search}
{tag=TODO}

Here we list domains for which the correct IP was apparently not found since there are no neighbouring hits.

These are suspicious, and suggest either that we didn't obtain the correct reverse IP, or a change in CIA methodology from an older time at which they were not yet using the obscene IP ranges.

For example, in the case of inews-today.com, <2013 DNS Census> gave one IP 193.203.49.212, but then <viewdns.info> gave another one 66.175.106.146 which fit into an existing IP range, and which assumed to be the correct IP of interest.

A similar case happened when we found IP 212.209.74.126 for headlines2day.com with <dnshistory.org>: https://dnshistory.org/historical-dns-records/a/headlines2day.com.

It is interesting to note that Reuters seems to have featured disproportionately many hits from that range, one wonders why that happened. It is possible that they chose these because they actually didn't have any nearby hits to give away less obvious information, though they did pick some from the ranges as wel.

In what follows we list the domains with possible reverse IPs and what was explored so far for each. We consider IPs not in a range to be uncertain, and that instead their domains might have been previously in a range which we

Likely hits possible but whose archives is too broken to be easily certain. If:

* proper reverse engineering of their comms if any, or any other page fingerprints
were to ever be found, these would be considered hits.

  But wrong IP? likely <CGI comms variant> under the signup page: https://web.archive.org/web/20090405045548/http://nouvelles-d-aujourdhuis.com/members.html[].

  Tested <viewdns.info> range: 216.97.231.46 - 216.97.231.66. Not a single reverse IP hit in there.

  <viewdns.info> also assigns it 50.63.202.46, GoDaddy.com, LLC, 2013-11-08 in addition to 216.97.231.56, Canada, IPXO LLC, 2013-09-06. This is very near other iranfootballsource.com flukes, so likely useless.

  <securitytrails.com> also gives it one earlier IP 209.200.240.250 last seen 2008-09-20: https://securitytrails.com/domain/nouvelles-d-aujourdhuis.com/history/a Hydra Communications Ltd before 216.97.231.56 "ASU doctor" first seen 2008-09-20 (15 years)> Tested viewdns.info range: 209.200.240.240 - 209.200.240.260 empty at the time of interest.

  Marked copyright 2006, so mega early.

= TODO
{parent=Methodology}

= Find missing hits in IP ranges
{parent=TODO}

All IP ranges have some holes in them for which we don't have a domain name.

It is because there was nothing there, or just because we don't have a good enough reverse IP database?

= How did Alexa find the domains?
{parent=TODO}

It can't be <HTML> crawl because presumably there wouldn't have been links to those websites? Presumably this is why <Common Crawl> doesn't seem to have any hits.

So they must have had some kind of DNS A record database?

Or would IPv4 sweep have worked, without the `Host` header with the CIA's setup?

The same question also applies to the <2013 DNS Census>. It has less hits, but still has many.

Whatever they did, we are so so glad that they did!

= Non .com .net TLDs
{parent=TODO}

.com and .net are very dominant. Here we list other choices made:
* `.info`: has a few hits:
  * archived <comms>:
    * beyondthefringe.info
  * unarchived <comms>:
    * crickettoday.info
  * unarchived:
    * talkingpointnews.info
    * theventurenews.info
    * worldconcerns.info
  Did a full <Wayback Machine CDX scanning> on .info after:
  ``
  grep -e news -e noticias -e nouvelles -e world -e global
  ``
  That makes about 10k domains, so it's about the right size.
* `.org`: has a least one hit, see: <Are there .org hits?>
* `.biz`:
  * unarchived <comms>:
    * atthemovies.biz

= Are there .org hits?
{parent=Non .com .net TLDs}

= .org hit
{synonym}

Previously it was unclear if there were any .org hits, until we found the first one with clear <comms>: https://web.archive.org/web/20110624203548/http://awfaoi.org/hand.jar

Later on, two more clear ones were found with <expired domain trackers>:
* azerinews.org
* autism-news.org
further settling their existence. Later on newimages.org also came to light.

Others that had been previously found in IP ranges but without clear comms:
* 65.61.127.177: material-science.org
* 212.4.17.61: tech-stop.org

Others in IP ranges by unarchived:
* 74.116.72.244 arborstribune.org

.org is very rare, and has been excluded from some of our search heuristics. That was a shame, but likely not much was missed.

= Data sources
{parent=Methodology}

This is a dark art, and many of the sources are shady as fuck! We often have no idea of their methodology. Also no source is fully complete. We just piece up as best we can.

In order to explore IPs in known IP ranges, what we need are good <DNS databases>.

* https://www.zone-h.org/archive/ip=208.76.80.93/page=11?hz=1 mentions `newsupdatesite.com` and mentions "defacement", the <Mass Deface III pastebin> comes to mind. No other nearby hits on quick inspection.

= Reuters article
{parent=Data sources}
{title2=2022-09-29}

https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran

This is our primary data source, the first article that pointed out <The Reuters websites>[a few specific CIA websites] which then served as the basis for all of our research.

We take the truth of this article as an <axiom>. And then all we claim is that all other websites found were made by the same people due to strong <Fingerprints>[shared design principles] of the such websites.

= Wayback Machine
{parent=Data sources}

D'oh.

But to be serious. The </Wayback Machine> contains a very large proportion of all sites. It is the most complete database we have found so far. Some archives are very broken. But those are rares.

The only problem with the </Wayback Machine> is that there is no known efficient way to query its archives across domains. You have to have a domain in hand for CDX queries: <Wayback Machine CDX scanning>.

The <Common Crawl> project attempts in part to address this lack of querriability, but we haven't managed to extract any hits from it.

CDX + <2013 DNS Census> + heuristics however has been fruitful however.

= Wayback Machine CDX scanning
{parent=Wayback Machine}

The Wayback Machine has an endpoint to query cralwed pages called the CDX server. It is documented at: https://github.com/internetarchive/wayback/blob/master/wayback-cdx-server/README.md[].

This allows to filter down 10 thousands of possible domains in a few hours. But 100s of thousands would be too much. This is because you have to query exactly one URL at a time, and they possibly rate limit IPs. But no IP blacklisting so far after several hours, so it's not that bad.

Once you have a heuristic to narrow down some domains, you can use this helper: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/cdx.sh] to drill them down from 10s of thousands down to hundreds or thousands.

We then post process the results of cdx.sh with \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/cdx-post.sh] to drill them down from from thousands to dozens, and manually inspect everything.

From then on, you can just manually inspect for hist on your browser.

= Wayback Machine CDX scanning with Tor parallelization
{parent=Wayback Machine CDX scanning}

Dire times require dire methods: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/cdx-tor.sh].

First we must start the tor servers with the `tor-army` command from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14321214/how-to-run-multiple-tor-processes-at-once-with-different-exit-ips/76749983#76749983
``
tor-army 100
``
and then use it on a newline separated domain name list to check;
``
./cdx-tor.sh infile.txt
``
This creates a directory `infile.txt.cdx/` containing:
* `infile.txt.cdx/out00`, `out01`, etc.: the suspected CDX lines from domains from each tor instance based on the simple criteria that the CDX can handle directly. We split the input domains into 100 piles, and give one selected pile per tor instance.
* `infile.txt.cdx/out`: the final combined CDX output of `out00`, `out01`, ...
* `infile.txt.cdx/out.post`: the final output containing only domain names that match further CLI criteria that cannot be easily encoded on the CDX query. This is the cleanest domain name list you should look into at the end basically.

Since archive is so abysmal in its data access, e.g. a <Google BigQuery> would solve our issues in seconds, we have to come up with creative ways of getting around their IP throttling.

The <CIA> doesn't play fair. They're actually the exact opposite of fair. So neither shall we.

Distilled into an answer at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14321214/how-to-run-multiple-tor-processes-at-once-with-different-exit-ips/76749983#76749983

This should allow a full sweep of the 4.5M records in <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup> in a reasonable amount of time. After JAR/SWF/CGI filtering we obtained 5.8k domains, so a reduction factor of about 1 million with likely very few losses. Not bad.

5.8k is still a bit annoying to fully go over however, so we can also try to count CDX hits to the domains and remove anything with too many hits, since the CIA websites basically have very few archives:
``
cd 2013-dns-census-a-novirt-domains.txt.cdx
./cdx-tor.sh -d out.post domain-list.txt
cd out.post.cdx
cut -d' ' -f1 out | uniq -c | sort -k1 -n | awk 'match($2, /([^,]+),([^)]+)/, a) {printf("%s.%s %d\n", a[2], a[1], $1)}' > out.count
``
This gives us something like:
``
12654montana.com 1
aeronet-news.com 1
atohms.com 1
av3net.com 1
beechstreetas400.com 1
``
sorted by increasing hit counts, so we can go down as far as patience allows for!

New results from a full CDX scan of 2013-dns-census-a-novirt.csv:
* 219.90.61.123 journeystravelled.com

= JS CDX scanning
{parent=Wayback Machine CDX scanning}

JAR, SWF and CGI-bin scanning by path only is fine, since there are relatively few of those. But .js scanning by path only is too broad.

One option would be to filter out by size, an information that is contained on the CDX. Let's check typical ones:
``
grep -f <(jq -r '.[]|select(select(.comms)|.comms|test("\\.js"))|.host' ../media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.json) out | out.jshits.cdx
sort -n -k7 out.jshits.cdx
``
Ignoring some obvious unrelated non-comms files visually we get a range of about 2732 to 3632:
``
net,hollywoodscreen)/current.js 20110106082232 http://hollywoodscreen.net/current.js text/javascript 200 XY5NHVW7UMFS3WSKPXLOQ5DJA34POXMV 2732

``
This ignores the obviously atypical <JavaScript with SHAs> from iranfootballsource, and the particularly small old menu.js from cutabovenews.com, which we embed into \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/cdx-post-js.sh].

The size helps a bit, but it's not insanely good unfortunately, only about 3x, these are some common JS sizes right there!

= Wayback Machine crawl date search
{parent=Wayback Machine}

Many hits appear to happen on the same days, and per-day data does exist: https://archive.org/details/widecrawl but apparently cannot be publicly downloaded unfortunately. But maybe there's another way? TODO select candidates.

= viewdns.info
{parent=Data sources}
{tag=Data as a service}
{title2=2010-}

Accounts used so far: 6 (1500 reverse IP checks).

Their historic DNS and reverse DNS info was very valuable, and served as Ciro's the initial entry point to finding hits in the IP ranges given by Reuters.

Generic information about the website not specific on this project will be stored at: </viewdns.info>{full}.

Since this source is so scarce and valuable, we have been quite careful to note down all the domain and IP ranges that have been explored.

At https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38496244[], the creator of the viewdns.info, "Hughesey", also stated that he'd able to give some free credits for public research projects such as this one. This would have saved up going to quite a few Cafes to get those sweet extra IPs! But it was more fun in hardmode, no doubt.

We do API access to IP ranges with this simple helper: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh], usage:
``
./viewdns-info.sh <apikey> <start-ipv-address> <end-ipv-address>
``
e.g.:
``
./viewdns-info.sh 8b890b00b17ed2d66bbed878d51200b58d43d014 66.45.179.187 66.45.179.210
``

For domain to IP queries from the API you should use "iphistory" https://viewdns.info/api/docs/ip-history.php[]:
``
curl 'https://api.viewdns.info/iphistory/?domain=todaysengineering.com&apikey=$APIKEY&output=json'
``

Just beware of the <viewdns.info reverse IP bug>, that really sucks and led to us missing a ton of domains.

= DNS Census 2013
{parent=Data sources}

= 2013 DNS Census
{synonym}

Main article: </DNS Census 2013>.

This data source was very valuable, and led to many hits, and to finding the first non Reuters ranges with <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census>{full}.

Hit overlap:
``
jq -r '.[].host' ../media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.json ) | xargs -I{} sqlite3 aiddcu.sqlite "select * from t where d = '{}'"
``
Domain hit count when we were at 279 hits: 142 hits, so about half of the hits were present.

The timing of the database is perfect for this project, it is as if the CIA had planted it themselves!

= 2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup
{parent=DNS Census 2013}

We've noticed that often when there is a hit range:
* there is only one IP for each domain
* there is a range of about 20-30 of those
and that this does not seem to be that common. Let's see if that is a reasonable fingerprint or not.

Note that although this is the most common case, we have found multiple hits that <viewdns.info> maps to the same IP.

First we create a table `u` (`unique`) that only have domains which are the only domain for an IP, let's see by how much that lowers the 191 M total unique domains:
``
time sqlite3 u.sqlite 'create table t (d text, i text)'
time sqlite3 av.sqlite -cmd "attach 'u.sqlite' as u" "insert into u.t select min(d) as d, min(i) as i from t where d not like '%.%.%' group by i having count(distinct d) = 1"
``
The `not like '%.%.%'` removes subdomains from the counts so that <CGI comms> are still included, and `distinct` in `count(distinct` is because we have multiple entries at different timestamps for some of the hits.

Let's start with the 208 subset to see how it goes:
``
time sqlite3 av.sqlite -cmd "attach 'u.sqlite' as u" "insert into u.t select min(d) as d, min(i) as i from t where i glob '208.*' and d not like '%.%.%' and (d like '%.com' or d like '%.net') group by i having count(distinct d) = 1"
``
OK, after we fixed bugs with the above we are down to 4 million lines with unique domain/IP pairs and which contains all of the original hits! Almost certainly more are to be found!

This data is so valuable that we've decided to upload it to: https://archive.org/details/2013-dns-census-a-novirt.csv Format:
``
8,chrisjmcgregor.com
11,80end.com
28,fine5.net
38,bestarabictv.com
49,xy005.com
50,cmsasoccer.com
80,museemontpellier.net
100,newtiger.com
108,lps-promptservice.com
111,bridesmaiddressesshow.com
``
The numbers of the first column are the IPs as a 32-bit integer representation, which is more useful to search for ranges in.

To make a <histogram> with the distribution of the single hostname IPs:
``
#!/usr/bin/env bash
bin=$((2**24))
sqlite3 2013-dns-census-a-novirt.sqlite -cmd '.mode csv' >2013-dns-census-a-novirt-hist.csv <<EOF
select i, sum(cnt) from (
  select floor(i/${bin}) as i,
         count(*) as cnt
    from t
    group by 1
  union
  select *, 0 as cnt from generate_series(0, 255)
)
group by i
EOF
gnuplot \
  -e 'set terminal svg size 1200, 800' \
  -e 'set output "2013-dns-census-a-novirt-hist.svg"' \

  -e 'set ylabel "count"' \
  -e 'plot "2013-dns-census-a-novirt-hist.csv" using 1:2:1 with labels' \
;
``
Which gives the following useless noise, there is basically no pattern:

There are two keywords that are killers: "news" and "world" and their translations or closely related words. Everything else is hard. So a good start is:

``

``

iran + football:

3 easy hits with "noticias" (news in Portuguese or Spanish"), uncovering two brand new ip ranges:

* 66.237.236.247 comunidaddenoticias.com

= 2013 DNS census MX records
{parent=DNS Census 2013}

Let' see if there's anything in records/mx.xz.

mx.csv is 21GB.

They do have `"` in the files to escape commas so:

mx.py
``
import csv
import sys
writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
with open('mx.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        writer.writerow([row[0], row[3]])
``
Would have been better with csvkit: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36287982/bash-parse-csv-with-quotes-commas-and-newlines

then:

``
# uniq not amazing as there are often two or three slightly different records repeated on multiple timestamps, but down to 11 GB
python3 mx.py | uniq > mx-uniq.csv
sqlite3 mx.sqlite 'create table t(d text, m text)'
# 13 GB
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite ".import --csv --skip 1 'mx-uniq.csv' t"

# 41 GB
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite 'create index td on t(d)'
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite 'create index tm on t(m)'

# Remove dupes.

delete from t
where rowid not in (
  select min(rowid)
  from t
  group by d, m
)
EOF

# 15 GB
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite vacuum
``

Let's see what the hits use:
``
awk -F, 'NR>1{ print $2 }' ../media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.csv | xargs -I{} sqlite3 mx.sqlite "select distinct * from t where d = '{}'"
``

At around 267 total hits, only 84 have MX records, and from those that do, almost all of them have exactly:
``
smtp.secureserver.net
mailstore1.secureserver.net
``
with only three exceptions:
``
dailynewsandsports.com|dailynewsandsports.com
inews-today.com|mail.inews-today.com
just-kidding-news.com|just-kidding-news.com
``
We need to count out of the totals!
``
sqlite3 mx.sqlite "select count(*) from t where m = 'mailstore1.secureserver.net'"
``
which gives, ~18M, so nope, it is too much by itself...

Let's try to use that to reduce `av.sqlite` from <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup> a bit further:
``
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite '.mode csv' "attach 'aiddcu.sqlite' as 'av'" '.load ./ip' "select ipi2s(av.t.i), av.t.d from av.t inner join t as mx on av.t.d = mx.d and mx.m = 'mailstore1.secureserver.net' order by av.t.i asc" > avm.csv
``
where `avm` stands for `av` with `mx` pruning. This leaves us with only ~500k entries left. With one more figerprint we could do a <Wayback Machine CDX scanning> scan.

Let's check that we still have most our hits in there:
``
grep -f <(awk -F, 'NR>1{print $2}' /home/ciro/bak/git/media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.csv) avm.csv
``
At 267 hits we got 81, so all are still present.

We intersect <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup> with <2013 DNS census MX records> and that leaves 460k hits. We did lose a third on the the MX records as of 260 hits since secureserver.net is only used in 1/3 of sites, but we also concentrate 9x, so it may be worth it.

ns.csv is 57 GB. This file is too massive, working with it is a pain.

We can also cut down the data a lot with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1915636/is-there-a-way-to-uniq-by-column/76605540#76605540[] and <Non .com .net TLDs>[tld filtering]:

``
This brings us down to a much more manageable 3.0 GB, 83 M rows.

Let's just scan it once real quick to start with, since likely nothing will come of this venue:
``

Doubt anything will come out of this.

Let's do a bit of counting out of the total:
``
grep domaincontrol.com ns.csv | awk -F, '{print $1}' | uniq | wc
``
gives ~20M domain using `domaincontrol`. Let's see how many domains are in the first place:
``
awk -F, '{print $1}' ns.csv | uniq | wc
``
so it accounts for 1/4 of the total.

= 2013 DNS census SOA records
{parent=DNS Census 2013}

Same as <2013 DNS census NS records> basically, nothing came out.

= dnshistory.org
{parent=Data sources}

dnshistory.org contains historical domain -> mappings.

We have not managed to extract much from this source, they don't have as much data on the range of interest.

But they do have some unique data at least, perhaps we should try them a bit more often, e.g. they were the only source we've seen so far that made the association: headlines2day.com -> 212.209.74.126 which places it in the more plausible globalbaseballnews.com IP range.

TODO can it do IP to domain? Or just domain to IP? Asked on their Discord: https://discord.com/channels/698151879166918727/968586102493552731/1124254204257632377[]. Their banner suggests that yes:
> With our new look website you can now find other domains hosted on the same IP address, your website neighbours and more even quicker than before.

Owner replied, you can't:
> At the moment you can only do this for current not historical records

This is a shame, reverse IP here could be quite valuable.

In principle, we could obtain this data from search engines, but Google doesn't track that entire website well, e.g. no hits for `site:dnshistory.org "62.22.60.48"` presumably due to heavy IP throttling.

Homepage https://dnshistory.org/ gives date starting in 2009:
> Here at DNS History we have been crawling DNS records since 2009, our database currently contains over 1 billion domains and over 12 billion DNS records.
and it is true that they do have some hits from that useful era.

Any data that we have the patience of extracting from this we will dump under https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.json[].

= securitytrails.com
{parent=Data sources}

They appear to piece together data from various sources. This is the most complete historical domain -> IP database we have so far. They don't have hugely more data than <viewdns.info>, but many times do offer something new. It feels like the key difference is that their data goes further back in the critical time period a bit.

TODO do they have historical reverse IP? The fact that they don't seem to have it suggests that they are just making historical reverse IP requests to a third party via some API?

E.g. searching `thefilmcentre.com` under historical data at https://securitytrails.com/domain/thefilmcentre.com/history/al gives the correct IP 62.22.60.55.

But searching the IP 62.22.60.55 is empty and there's no historical data option?

Account creation blacklists common email providers such as gmail to force users to use a "corporate" email address. But using random domains like `ciro@cirosantilli.com` works fine.

Their data seems to date back to 2008 for our searches.

= Common Crawl
{parent=Data sources}

So far, no new domains have been found with <Common Crawl>, nor have any existing known domains been found to be present in Common Crawl. Our working theory is that Common Crawl never reached the domains <How did Alexa find the domains?>

Let's try and do something with <Common Crawl>.

Unfortunately there's no <IP> data apparently: https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-index-table/issues/30[], so let's focus on the URLs.

Using their <Common Crawl Athena> method: https://commoncrawl.org/2018/03/index-to-warc-files-and-urls-in-columnar-format/

So `url_host_3rd_last_part` might be a winner for <CGI comms> fingerprinting!

Naive one for one index:

Let's see if they have any of the domain hits. Let's also restrict by date to try and reduce the data scanned:
``

   'topbillingsite.com',
   'worldwildlifeadventure.com'
 )
``
Humm, data scanned: 60.59 GB and no hits... weird.

Sanity check:
``
select * from "ccindex"."ccindex" WHERE
  crawl = 'CC-MAIN-2013-20' AND
  subset = 'warc' AND
  url_host_registered_domain IN (
   'google.com',
   'amazon.com'
 )
``
has a bunch of hits of course. Also Data scanned: 212.88 MB, `WHERE` `crawl` and `subset` are a must! Should have read the article first.

Let's widen a bit more:
``
select * from "ccindex"."ccindex" WHERE
  crawl IN (
    'CC-MAIN-2013-20',
    'CC-MAIN-2013-48',

Does not appear to have any reverse IP hits unfortunately: https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/1951/dataset-of-domain-names/21077#21077[]. Likely only has domains that were explicitly advertised.

We could not find anything useful in it so far, but there is great potential to use this tool to find new IP ranges based on properties of existing IP ranges. Part of the problem is that the dataset is huge, and is split by top 256 bytes. But it would be reasonable to at least explore ranges with pre-existing known hits...

We have started looking for patterns on `66.*` and `208.*`, both selected as two relatively far away ranges that have a number of pre-existing hits. 208 should likely have been 212 considering later finds that put several ranges in 212.

Suggests exactly 223 - 192 + 1 = 31 IPs.

Let's have a look at the file `68`: outcome: no clear hits like on 208. One wonders why.

It does appears that long sequences of ranges are a sort of fingerprint. The question is how unique it would be.

First:
``
n=208
time awk '$3=="up"{ print $1 }' $n | uniq -c | sed -r 's/^ +//;s/ /,/' | tee $n-up-uniq
t=$n-up-uniq.sqlite
rm -f $t
time sqlite3 $t 'create table tmp(cnt text, i text)'
time sqlite3 $t ".import --csv $n-up-uniq tmp"
time sqlite3 $t 'create table t (i integer)'
time sqlite3 $t '.load ./ip' 'insert into t select str2ipv4(i) from tmp'
time sqlite3 $t 'drop table tmp'
time sqlite3 $t 'create index ti on t(i)'
``
This reduces us to 2 million IP rows from the total possible 16 million IPs.

OK now just counting hits on fixed windows has way too many results:
``
sqlite3 208-up-uniq.sqlite "\
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT min(i), COUNT(*) OVER (
    ORDER BY i RANGE BETWEEN 15 PRECEDING AND 15 FOLLOWING
  ) as c FROM t
) WHERE c > 20 and c < 30
"
``

Let's try instead consecutive ranges of length exactly 31 instead then:
``
sqlite3 208-up-uniq.sqlite <<EOF
SELECT f, t - f as c FROM (
  SELECT min(i) as f, max(i) as t
  FROM (SELECT i, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY i) - i as grp FROM t)
  GROUP BY grp
  ORDER BY i
) where c = 31
EOF
``
271. Hmm. A bit more than we'd like...

Another route is to also count the ups:
``
n=208
time awk '$3=="up"{ print $1 }' $n | uniq -c | sed -r 's/^ +//;s/ /,/' | tee $n-up-uniq-cnt
t=$n-up-uniq-cnt.sqlite
rm -f $t
time sqlite3 $t 'create table tmp(cnt text, i text)'
time sqlite3 $t ".import --csv $n-up-uniq-cnt tmp"
time sqlite3 $t 'create table t (cnt integer, i integer)'
time sqlite3 $t '.load ./ip' 'insert into t select cnt as integer, str2ipv4(i) from tmp'
time sqlite3 $t 'drop table tmp'
time sqlite3 $t 'create index ti on t(i)'
``

Let's see how many consecutives with counts:
``
sqlite3 208-up-uniq-cnt.sqlite <<EOF
SELECT f, t - f as c FROM (
  SELECT min(i) as f, max(i) as t
  FROM (SELECT i, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY i) - i as grp FROM t WHERE cnt >= 3)
  GROUP BY grp
  ORDER BY i
) where c > 28 and c < 32
EOF
``

Let's check on 66:
``
grep -e '66.45.179' -e '66.45.179' 66
``
not representative at all... e.g. several convfirmed hits are down:

Domain list only, no IPs and no dates. We haven't been able to extract anything of interest from this source so far.

Domain hit count when we were at 69 hits: only 9, some of which had been since reused. Likely their data collection did not cover the dates of interest.

= Expired domain trackers
{parent=Data sources}

When you <Google> most of the hit domains, many of them show up on "expired domain trackers", and above all Chinese expired domain trackers for some reason, notably e.g.:
* https://hupo.com[]: e.g. http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2012-03-06（国际域名）.txt[]. Heavily IP throttled. Tor hindered more than helped.

  First known working day: `2011-07-29`.

  Scraping script: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hupo.sh]. Scraping does about 1 day every 5 minutes relatively reliably, so about 36 hours / year. Not bad.

  Results are stored under `tmp/humo/<day>`.

  Check for hit overlap:
  ``
  grep -Fx -f <( jq -r '.[].host' ../media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.json ) cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/tmp/hupo/*
  ``
  The hits are very well distributed amongst days and months, at least they did a good job hiding these potential timing fingerprints. This feels very deliberately designed.

  There are lots of hits. The data set is very inclusive. Also we understand that it must have been obtains through means other than <Web crawling>, since it contains so many of the hits.

  Nice output format for scraping as the HTML is very minimal

  They randomly changed their URL format to remove the space before the .com after 2012-02-03:
  * http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2012-01-01（国际域名）%20.txt
  * http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2013-01-01（国际域名）.txt

  Some of their files are simply missing however unfortunately, e.g. neither of the following exist:
  * http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2012-07-01（国际域名）%20.txt
  * http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2012-07-01（国际域名）.txt
  webmasterhome.cn did contain that one however: http://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2012-07-01.asp[]. Hmm. we might have better luck over there then?

  2018-11-19 is corrupt in a new and wonderful way, with a bunch of trailing zeros:
  ``
  wget -O hupo-2018-11-19 'http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2018-11-19%EF%BC%88%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85%E5%9F%9F%E5%90%8D%EF%BC%89.txt

  More generally, several files contain invalid domain names with non-ASCII characters, e.g. 2013-01-02 contains `365<D3>л<FA><C2><CC>.com`. Domain names can only contain ASCII charters: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1133424/what-are-the-valid-characters-that-can-show-up-in-a-url-host Maybe we should get rid of any such lines as noise.

  Some files around 2011-09-06 start with an empty line. 2014-01-15 starts with about twenty empty lines. Oh and that last one also has some trash bytes the end  `<B7><B5><BB><D8>`. Beauty.
* https://webmasterhome.cn[]: e.g. http://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2012-03-06.asp[]. Appears to contain the exact same data as "static.hupo.com"

  First known working day: `2011-08-18`.

  Also heavily IP throttled, and a bit more than hupo apparently.

  Scraper \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/webmastercn.sh].

  Also has some randomly missing dates like hupo.com, though different missing ones from hupo, so they complement each other nicely.

  Some of the URLs are broken and don't inform that with HTTP status code, they just replace the results with some Chinese text 无法找到该页 (The requested page could not be found):
  * https://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2012-02-06.asp
  * https://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2012-02-14.asp
  * https://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2013-04-30.asp

  Several URLs just return length 0 content, e.g.:
  ``
  curl -vvv http://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2015-10-31.asp
  *   Trying 125.90.93.11:80...
  * Connected to domain.webmasterhome.cn (125.90.93.11) port 80 (#0)

  ``
  It is not fully clear if this is a throttling mechanism, or if the data is just missing entirely.

  Starting around 2018, the IP limiting became very intense, 30 mins / 1 hour per URL, so we just gave up. Therefore, data from 2018 onwards does not contain webmasterhome.cn data.

  Starting from `2013-05-10` the format changes randomly. This also shows us that they just have all the HTML pages as static files on their server. E.g. with:
  ``
  grep -a '<pre' * | s
  ``
  we see:
  ``
  2013-05-09:<pre style='font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; '><strong>2013<C4><EA>05<D4><C2>09<C8>յ<BD><C6>ڹ<FA><BC><CA><D3><F2><C3><FB></strong><br>0-3y.com

* https://justdropped.com[]: e.g. https://www.justdropped.com/drops/010112com.html[]. First known working day: `2006-01-01`. Unthrottled.
* http://yoid.com[]: e.g.: http://yoid.com/bydate.php?d=2016-06-03&a=a[]. First known workding day: `2016-06-01`.
This suggests that scraping these lists might be a good starting point to obtaining "all expired domains ever".

Data comparison:
* 2012-01-01
  * http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2012-01-01%EF%BC%88%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85%E5%9F%9F%E5%90%8D%EF%BC%89%20.txt
  * http://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2012-01-01.asp
  * https://www.justdropped.com/drops/010112com.html
  Looking only at the `.com`:
  * webmastercn has just about ten extra ones than justdropped, the rest is exactly the same
  * justdropped has some extra and some missing from hupo
  The lists are quite similar however.

  Considering toplevels:
  * hupo has several toplevels that webmastercn does not have, e.g. .org and many others
  * justdropped only covers exactly 6 tlds: `.us`, `.org`, `.net`, `.info`, `.com` and `.biz`. The `.com` lists are very similar to hupo + webmastercn. But it has a lot more non-`.com` domains apparently.

We've made the following pipelines for hupo.com + webmasterhome.cn merging:
``
./hupo.sh &
./webmastercn.sh &
./justdropped.sh &
wait
./justdropped-post.sh

TODO what does this Chinese forum track? New registrations? Their focus seems to be <domain name speculation>

Some of the threads contain domain dumps. We haven't yet seen a scrapable URL pattern, but their data goes way back and did have various hits. The forum seems to have started in 2006: https://club.domain.cn/forum.php?mod=forumdisplay&fid=41&page=10127

https://club.domain.cn/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=241704 "【国际域名拟删除列表】2007年06月16日" is the earliest list we could find. It is an expired domain list.

Some hits:
* https://club.domain.cn/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=709388 contains `alljohnny.com` The thread title is "2009.5.04". The post date 2009-04-30

= "Mass Deface III" pastebin
{parent=Data sources}

https://pastebin.com/CTXnhjeS dated mega early on Sep 30th, 2012 by CYBERTAZIEX.

This source was <found by Oleg Shakirov>.

Holy fuck the type of data source that we get in this area of work!

This pastebin contained a few new hits, in addition to some pre-existing ones. Most of the hits them seem to be linked to the IP 72.34.53.174, which presumably is a major part of the fingerprint found by CYBERTAZIEX, though unsurprisingly methodology is unclear. As documented, the domains appear to be linked to a "Condor hosting" provider, but it is hard to find any information about it online.

<Ciro Santilli> checked every single non-subdomain domain in the list.

Other files under the same account: https://pastebin.com/u/cybertaziex did not seem of interest.

The author's real name appears to be Deni Suwandi: https://twitter.com/denz_999 from <#Indonesia>, but all accounts appear to be inactive, otherwise we'd ping him to ask for more info about the list.

= ipinf.ru
{parent=Data sources}

https://ipinf.ru

OK, <Oleg Shakirov's findings> inspired <Ciro Santilli> to try <Yandexing> a bit more...

`alljohnny.com` had a hit: https://ipinf.ru/domains/alljohnny.com/[], and so Ciro started looking around... and a good number of other things have hits.

Not all of them, definitely less data than <viewdns.info>.

But they do reverse IP, and they show which nearby reverse IPs have hits on the same page, for free, which is great!

Shame their ordering is purely alphabetical, doesn't properly order the IPs so it is a bit of a pain, but we can handle it.

OMG, <Russians>!!!

The data here had a little bit of non-overlap from other sources. 4 new confirmed hits were found, plus 4 possible others that were left as candidates.

= Reverse engineering
{parent=Methodology}

In this section we document the outcomes of more detailed inspection of both the communication mechanisms (<JavaScript>, <JAR (file format)>, swf) and <HTML> that might help to better fingerprint the websites.

= Communication mechanism
{parent=Reverse engineering}

= Comms
{synonym}
{title2}

There are four main types of communication mechanisms found:
* <Java> <JAR (file format)>

  There is also one known instance where a .zip extension was used! https://web.archive.org/web/20131101104829*/http://plugged-into-news.net/weatherbug.zip as:
  ``
  <applet codebase="/web/20101229222144oe_/http://plugged-into-news.net/" archive="/web/20101229222144oe_/http://plugged-into-news.net/weatherbug.zip"
  ``

  JAR is the most common comms, and one of the most distinctive, making it a great <fingerprint>.

  Several of the JAR files are named something like either:
  * meter.jar
  * bandwidth.jar
  * speed.jar
  as if to pose as Internet speed testing tools? The wonderful subtleties of the late 2000s Internet are a bit over our heads.

  All JARs are directly under root, not in subdirectories, and the basename usually consist of one word, though sometimes two camel cased.
* <JavaScript> file. There are two subtypes:
  * <JavaScript with SHAs>. Rare. Likely older. Way more fingerprintable.
  * JavaScript without SHAs. They have all been obfuscated slightly different and compressed. But the file sizes are all very similar from 8kB to 10kB, and they all look similar, so visually it is very easy to detect a match with good likelyhood.
* <Adobe Flash> swf file. In all instances found so far, the name of the SWF matches the name of the second level domain exactly, e.g.:
  ``
  http://tee-shot.net/tee-shot.swf
  ``
  While this is somewhat of a fingerprint, it is worth noting that is was a relatively commonly used pattern. But it is also the rarest of the mechanisms. This is a at a dissonance with the rest of the web, which circa 2010 already had way more SWF than JAR apparently.
* <CGI comms>
These have short single word names with some meaning linked to their website.

Because the communication mechanisms are so crucial, they tend to be less varied, and serve as very good fingerprints. It is not ludicrous, e.g. identical files, but one look at a few and you will know the others.

= CGI comms
{parent=Communication mechanism}

= CGI
{synonym}

We've come across a few shallow and stylistically similar websites on suspicious ranges with this pattern.

No JS/JAR/SWF comms, but rather a subdomain, and an HTTPS page with .cgi extension that leads to a login page. Some names seen for this subdomain:
* `secure.`: most common
* `ssl.`: also common
* various other more creative ones linked to the website theme itself, e.g.:
  * musical-fortune.net has a backstage.musical-fortune.net

The question is, is this part of some legitimate tooling that created such patterns? And if so which? Or are they actual hits with a new comms mechanism not previously seen?

The fact that:
* hits of this type are so dense in the suspicious ranges
* they are so stylistically similar between on another
* citizenlabs specifically mentioned a "CGI" comms method
suggests to Ciro that they are an actual hit.

In particular, the `secure` and `ssl` ones are overused, and together with some heuristics allowed us to find our first two non Reuters ranges! <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census>{full}

Some currently known URLs
* https://backstage.musical-fortune.net/cgi-bin/backstage.cgi

If we could do a crawl search for `secure.*com/cgi-bin/*.cgi` that might be a good enough fingerprint, maybe even `*.*com/cgi-bin/*.cgi`. Edit: it is not perfect, but we kind of did it: <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census>{full}.

Since these are so rare, it is still a bit hard to classify them for sure, but they are of great interest no doubt, as as we start to notice these patterns more tend to come if it is a thing.

{parent=JavaScript reverse engineering}

The <JavaScript> of each website appears to be quite small and similarly sized. They are all minimized, but have reordered things around a bit.

For example consider: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202190932/http://feedsdemexicoyelmundo.com/mundo.js

First we have to know that the <Wayback Machine> adds some stuff before and after the original code. The actual code there starts at:
``
ap={fg:['MSXML2.XMLHTTP
``
and ends in:
``
ck++;};return fu;};
``

We can use a <JavaScript> beautifier such as https://beautifier.io/ to be abe to better read the code.

It is worth noting that there's a lot of `<script>` tags inline as well, which seem to matter.

Further analysis would be needed.

= Google searches for known domains and IPs
{c}
{parent=Methodology}

Googling most domains gives only very few results, and most of them are just useless lists of expired domains. Skipping those for now.

Googling `"dedrickonline.com"` has a git at https://www.webwiki.de/dedrickonline.com# Furthermore, it also contains the IP address "65.61.127.174" under the "Technik" tab!

Unfortunately that website appears to be split by language? E.g. the English version does not contain it: https://www.webwiki.com/dedrickonline.com[], which would make searching a bit harder, but still doable.

But if we can Google search those IPs there, we might just hit gold.

IP search did work! https://www.webwiki.de/65.61.127.174

But doesn't often/ever work unfortunately for others.

Googling "activegaminginfo.com" has a git at: http://cqcounter.com/whois/site/activegaminginfo.com.html which actually contains the IP 66.175.106.148! But I can't find a reverse IP search method. And perhaps due to having lots of <CAPTCHAs>, Google doesn't seem to index that website very well... it even has a tiny screenshot! And it also shows some more metadata beyond IP, e.g. HTTP response headers, which notably contain stuff like `Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1`.

Forward search of expired domains appears to often work however, and contains correct IPs and the screenshots. Note that direct access as follows does not work for some reason, you have to type them into the search bar manually:

{parent=Methodology}

Some less-trivial breakthroughs:
* finding <2013 DNS Census>
* <CGI comms> characterization
* <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census> let to a few hits
* <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup heuristic keyword searches> was massive and led to many new ranges

= Non Reuters ranges
{parent=Breakthroughs}

= secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census
{parent=Non Reuters ranges}

Grepping the <2013 DNS Census> first by overused <CGI comms> subdomains `secure.` and `ssl.` leaves 200k lines. Grepping for the overused "news" led to hits:
* secure.worldnewsandent.com,2012-02-13T21:28:15,208.254.40.117
* ssl.beyondnetworknews.com,2012-02-13T20:10:13,66.104.175.40

Also tried but failed:
* `sports`:
  * secure.motorsportdealers.com,2012-04-10T20:19:09,64.73.117.38 https://web.archive.org/web/20110501000000*/motorsportdealers.com[]

OK, after the initial successes in `secure.`, we went a bit more data intensive:
* took all `secure.*` `ssl.*` URLs in the <2013 DNS Census>, 70k entries
* cleaned up a bit, e.g. only `.com` or `.net`. this left only, 30k entries only
* lopped over all of them in archive CDX: <Wayback Machine CDX scanning>, searching for those that also end in `.cgi` https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=$domain&matchType=domain&filter=urlkey:.*.cgi&to=20140101000000[]. Took an afternoon, but no rate limit block.
* this leaves about 1000, so we loop over all of them manually on web archive with a script, and opened any that had the pattern of very vew hits between 2010 and 2013 only, and on those check for visual/thematic style match. Careful not to make more than 15 requests per minute or else 5 min blacklist!
New results: only one...
* 208.254.42.205 secure.driversinternationalgolf.com,2012-02-13T10:42:20,

After <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup heuristic keyword searches> we later understood why there were so few hits here: the <2013 DNS Census> didn't capture the `secure.` subdomains of many domains it had for some reason. Shame, because if it had, this method would have yielded many more results.

He then proceeded to <Searching for Carson>[give Carson] and 5 other domains in private communication. His name is given here with his consent. His advances besides not being blind were <Yandexing> for some of the known hits which led to pages that contained other hits:
* moyistochnikonlaynovykhigr.com contains a copy of myonlinegamesource.com, and both are present at https://www.seomastering.com/audit/pefl.ru/[], an SEO tracker, because both have backlinks to `pefl.ru`, which is apparently a niche fantasy football website
* 4 previously unknown hits from: <"Mass Deface III" pastebin>. He missed one which Ciro then found after inspecting all URLs on <Wayback Machine>, so leading to a total of 5 new hits from that source.

Unfortunately, these methods are not very generalizable, and didn't lead to a large number of other hits. But every domain counts!

The fact that the <Reuters article> has a screenshot of it, and therefore a <Wayback Machine> link, plus the specificity of the website topic, will likely keep Ciro awake at night for a while until someone finds that domain.

Some text visible on the Reuters screenshot:
* > Johnny Carson and The Tonight Show
* > Your Favorite Host and Comedic Genius
* > Submit Your Favorite Carson Moment
* > Heeere's Johnny!

  Holy crap, the "Here's Johnny" line from The Shining (1980) is a reference to Johnny Carson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDpipB4yehk[], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYnyPAkgyvc[], Ciro never knew that... but every American would have understood it at the time.
It is unclear however if this text is plaintext or part of a an image.

Searching the <Wayback Machine> proved fruitless. There is no full text search: <Wayback Machine full text search>, and a heuristic https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/Johnny%20Carson search has relevant hits but not the one we want.

Another attempt was to search for "carson" on webmasterhome.cn which lists expired domains in bulk by expiration day, and it search engine friendly. It contains most of the domains we've found so far. <Google> either doesn't support partial word search or requires you to be a <God> to find it

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28220652/google-custom-search-engine-and-partial-matching
so we settle for DuckDuckGo which supports it: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Awebmasterhome.cn+%22carson%22&t=h_&ia=web Adding years also helps: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Awebmasterhome.cn+%22carson%22+2011&ia=web with this we might be getting all possible results. Ciro went through all in 2011, 2012 and 2013 but no luck. Also fuck https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_City,_Nevada[] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California[] :-)

Let's search https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search for "carson" contained in any historic domain name. 10,001 lines. Grepping those, no good Wayback machine hits for those that also contain "johnny" or "show". Data at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/media/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/tools.whoisxmlapi.com_reverse-whois-search_carson.csv in case anyone want to try and dig...

Let's also search the fortuitously timed <2013 DNS Census>.

= Wakatime redirects
{c}
{parent=Work log}

Summary: this is just a red herring. Wakatime owner likely registered the domains just after this article was published as a <publicity stunt>. Fair play though.

As raised at: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36280666[], many, but not all, of the domains currently redirect to https://wakatime.com/[] as of 2023, and apparently they were taken up in 2013 (TODO how to confirm that). TODO what is the explanation for that? Some examples that do:
* http://dedrickonline.com
* http://tee-shot.net
But some failed resolution examples:
* http://pangawana.com/
* http://kessingerssportsnews.com/
Even more suspiciously, according to his LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanhamlett/[], the owner of Wakatime, Alan Hamlett, worked at WhiteHat Security, Inc from Aug 2011 - Sep 2013. The company was then acquired by Synopsys in 2022. Holy crap!!! As shown at: https://web.archive.org/web/20131013193406/https://www.whitehatsec.com/ that company made website security tools. Did that dude use the tools to find the vulnerabilty and then just gobble up all the domains??? What a fucking legend if he did!!!

Let's try:
* https://host.io/redirects/wakatime.com[]: failure
* https://www.whatsmydns.net/redirect-checker?q=wakatime.com[]: failure
* https://app.neilpatel.com/en/seo_analyzer/backlinks?domain=wakatime.com&mode=domain[]: failure

Running e.g.
``
curl -vvv dedrickonline.com
``
gives:
``
*   Trying 162.255.119.197:80...
* Connected to dedrickonline.com (162.255.119.197) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1

``
so we see that he must have setup redirection with Namecheap as mentioned at: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/385/2237/how-to-redirect-a-url-for-a-domain/

Let's also try <DNS> history

So these suggest Alan might have just come along in 2023 way after the 2022 Reuters article and did the same basic IP range search that Ciro is doing now, so possibly no new tech. Let's ask... https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1668369786865164289

The domain name history presented is however of interest, and could lead to patterns being found.

Searching https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search with term "Corral, Elizabeth" gave no results unfortunately.

Announcements by self:
* 2023-06-10: initial announcements
  * https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1667532991315230720[]. Follow up when more domains were found: https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1717445686214504830
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/OSINT/comments/146185r/i_found_16_new_cia_covert_communication_websites/[]. Marked as SPAM 5 by mods days later. After reaching 92 votes, a very positive reply for that niche sub, and being obviously on topic. Weird. Anyways, did its job and likely kicked off hackernews.

* 2023-10-26 https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1717445686214504830[]: announcement by self after finding 75 more sites
  * Shared by others soo after:
  * https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36279375#36280220[] (212 points). Shame that this was published when we only had about 20 websites. As of writing we had 240. Might have been a greater hit then.

  * https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14705gp/cia_2010_covert_communication_websites/ failed attempt with bad link unfortunately
* 2024-01-15: https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1747742453778559165[] <Oleg Shakirov's findings>

Reactions by others:
* 2023-06-19: https://www.reddit.com/r/numberstations/comments/14dexiu/after_numbers_stations_vanished/ (30 points) off topic on that sub, but thankfully was not deleted, interesting sub topic
* 2023-10-26: <Google Analytics> backlink from https://lms.fh-wedel.de/[] path unknown. Some shitty German university: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fachhochschule_Wedel_University_of_Applied_Sciences LMS stands for <Learning management system>, apparently a <Moodle> instance. Maybe they have some <Open educational resources>, but all in <German (language)> so pointless
* Second wave:
  * 2023-12-01: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38492304[] (65 points). Second submission but pointing to <OurBigBook.com> rather than cirosantilli.com: https://ourbigbook.com/cirosantilli/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites We take those. Reached only 65 points as of January 2024.
  * 2023-12-02: https://buttondown.email/grugq/archive/december-2-2023/[]. "grugq" is the handle of a zero day dealer whose received some scrutiny in 2012 after a Forbes protile was written about him: https://archive.ph/7mUG5[]. He comments:
    > I don’t think anyone anticipated that databases leaked by hackers would enable OSINT researchers to conduct counterintelligence investigations that rival the state security services.
  presumably referring to <DNS Census 2013>.
