= CIA 2010 covert communication websites
{c}
{tag=Ciro Santilli's naughty projects}
{tag=Open-source intelligence}
{scope}

This article is about <cutout (espionage)>[covert agent communication channel] websites used by the <CIA> in the late 2000s to early 2010s until they were uncovered by target countries. This discovery led to the imprisonment and execution of several assets in <Iran> and <China>.

The existence of such websites was first reported in November 2018 by Yahoo News: https://www.yahoo.com/video/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html[].

Then in September 2022 a few specific websites were reported by Reuters in September 2022: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran/[].

<Ciro Santilli> was already curious about those websites after hearing about the 2018 news, and even asked on <Quora>: https://www.quora.com/What-were-some-examples-of-the-websites-that-the-CIA-used-around-2010-as-a-communication-mechanism-for-its-spies-in-China-and-Iran-but-were-later-found-and-used-to-take-down-their-spy-networks[] but there were no publicly known domains at the time to serve as a starting point.

So <Ciro Santilli> heard about the 2022 article almost a year after publication, he <Ciro Santilli's naughty projects>[knew he had to try] and find some of the domains himself using the newly available information! It was an irresistible real-life <capture the flag (cybersecurity)>... Given that it was reported that there were "more than 350" such websites, it would be really cool if we could uncover more of those websites ourselves beyond the 9 domains reported by Reuters! Notably, being <Brazilian>, <Ciro Santilli> is particularly curious about the existence of a Brazilian-focused website one mentioned in the article, as well as in other <democracies>. WTF the <CIA> was doing in Brazil in the early 2010s! Wasn't the <Military dictatorship in Brazil> enough!

Here's the list of probable candidates Ciro has found so far using only rudimentary IP range search on https://viewdns.info[] starting from the websites reported by Reuters, more details on methods below. It is nothing compared to the hundreds of websites reported, so there must be key techniques missing. But the fact that there are no <Google Search> hits for the domains or IPs indicates that these might not have been previously clearly publicly disclosed. Ciro's initial investigation added 15 new websites to the original 8 published by Reuters.

If anyone can find others, or has better techniques, or wants to dump a bit of money on viewdns.info: <contact>{full}. viewdns.info only supports 250 free queries per IP which is very limiting. One option would be to <sponsor>[donate: \$39.95 to Ciro so he can make 2500 queries with the cheapest paid plan].

Disclaimer: the network fell in 2013, followed by fully public disclosures in 2018 and 2022, so I believe it is now more than safe for the public to know what can still be uncovered about the events that took place. My political bias is <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[strongly pro-democracy and anti-dictatorship]. But https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/dictatorships-tend-to-work-together[democracies have to work together and build mutual trust, and not spy on one another].

= Methodology
{parent=CIA 2010 covert communication websites}

https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/[] did an investigation and found 885 such websites, but decided not to disclose the list or methods:
\Q[
Using only a single website, as well as publicly available material such as historical internet scanning results and the <Internet Archive>'s <Wayback Machine>, we identified a network of 885 websites and have high confidence that the United States (US) Central Intelligence Agency (<CIA>) used these sites for covert communication.

The websites included similar <Java>, <JavaScript>, <Adobe Flash>, and CGI artifacts that implemented or apparently loaded covert communications apps. In addition, blocks of sequential IP addresses registered to apparently fictitious US companies were used to host some of the websites. All of these flaws would have facilitated discovery by hostile parties.

The websites, which purported to be news, weather, sports, healthcare, and other legitimate websites, appeared to be localized to at least 29 languages and geared towards at least 36 countries.

The bulk of the websites that we discovered were active at various periods between 2004 and 2013. We do not believe that the CIA has recently used this communications infrastructure. Nevertheless, a subset of the websites are linked to individuals who may be former and possibly still active intelligence community employees or assets:

* Several are currently abroad
* Another left mainland China in the time frame of the Chinese crackdown
* Another was subsequently employed by the US State Department
* Another now works at a foreign intelligence contractor

Given that we cannot rule out ongoing risks to CIA employees or assets, we are not publishing full technical details regarding our process of mapping out the network at this time. As a first step, we intend to conduct a limited disclosure to US government oversight bodies.
]

The websites were used from at least as early as August 2008, as per Gholamreza Hosseini's account, and the system was only shutdown in 2013 apparently.

Notably, so as to be less suspicious the websites are often in the language of the country for which they were intended, so we can often guess which country they were intended for!

Highlights:
* IP 65.61.127.174: dedrickonline.com.2010 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20101211095158/http://www.dedrickonline.com/[]. <German (language)> (!) sports website. Possible hit. The CIA has had a few Germany espionage scandals in the 2010s:
  * 2014 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28243933[]: a German Intelligence Agency agent was arrested for spying for the CIA
  * 2021 https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-security-agency-spied-merkel-other-top-european-officials-through-danish-2021-05-30/ U.S. spied on Merkel and other Europeans through Danish cables
  * 2020 https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-uss-cia-and-germanys-bnd-spied-on-world-leaders/a-52358527 it was revealed that Germany and the USA had an agreement to spy on world leaders, notably via compromised Swiss company Crypto AG

Reuters directly reported only two domains in writing:
* http://iraniangoals.com[]. Iranian language <football> website. As of 2023, the domain had been bought by Reuters and redirects to their website.

  2009 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20090411072857/http://iraniangoals.com/

  <JavaScript> file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091909/http://iraniangoals.com/journal.js[] <Reverse engineering> information: <iraniangoals.com JavaScript reverse engineering>.
* http://iraniangoalkicks.com[]. Iranian language <football> website. Available in GoDaddy as of 2023.

  2008 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20080211111124/http://iraniangoalkicks.com/

  <Java> <JAR (file format)> file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091917/http://iraniangoalkicks.com/clamping.jar

But by looking at the URLs of the screenshots they provided from other websites we can easily uncover all others that had screenshots, <Searching for Carson>[except for the Johnny Carson one], which is just generically named. E.g. the image for the Chinese one is https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/usa-spies-iran/screencap-activegaminginfo.com.jpg?v=192516290922 which leads us to domain http://activegaminginfo.com[].

Also none of those extra ones have any <Google> hits except for huge domain dumps, so maybe this counts as little bit of novel public research.

The full lits of domains from screenshots is:
* http://activegaminginfo.com[]: <Chinese (language)> gaming information website.

  2011 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20110208113503/http://activegaminginfo.com/[]. Contains mentions of 2010.

  The website is entitled:
  \Q[活跃游戏]
  which means "Lively games", or "active games" as in the domain name itself.

  Available in GoDaddy as of 2023.

  <Java> JAR file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202130304/http://activegaminginfo.com/gaming.jar
* http://capture-nature.com[]: <English (language)> photography website.

  2011 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20110201104659/http://capture-nature.com/[].

  As of 2023, it seemed to be an actual legit photography website by German (amateur?) photographer Klaus Wägele. Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20230323102504/https://www.capture-nature.com/

  <Ciro Santilli> actually sent him a message to let him know about the <CIA> thing in case he didn't, and he replied that he wasn't aware of it.

  <Java> JAR file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110201104851/http://capture-nature.com/Scenes.jar[].
* https://www.headlines2day.com/[]: Iranian language news website.

  2011 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20110201164741/https://www.headlines2day.com/[]. Dated "Copyright 2009".

  As of 2023, this was a completly broken-looking news website but in English entitled:
  \Q[Today's Headlines]
  2023 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20230121191348/https://www.headlines2day.com/[]. It makes one wonder if the <CIA> still operates it!

  <Java> JAR file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110203021403/http://fightwithoutrules.com/boxing.jar[].

This brings up to 8 known <domain names> with <Wayback Machine> archives, plus the yet unidentified Johnny Carlson one, see also: <Searching for Carson>{full}, which is also almost certainly is on Wayback Machine somewhere given that they have a screenshot of it.

From this we can establish see some clear stylistic trends across the websites which would allow us to find other likely candidates upon inspection:
* natural sounding, sometimes long-ish, English language <domain names> with 2 or 3 full words
* shallow websites with a few tabs, many external links, sometimes many images, and few internal pages
* common themes include:
  * news
  * hobbies, notably sports, travel and photography
* .com and .net <top-level domains>
* each one has one "communication mechanism file" which is either a:
  * <Java> <JAR (file format)>
  * <JavaScript> file
  * <Adobe Flash> swf file
  These have short single word names with some meaning linked to their website.
* narrow page width like in the days of old, lots of images

= IP range search
{parent=Methodology}

One promising way to find more of those would be with <IP> searches, since it was stated in the Reuter article that the <CIA> made the terrible mistake of using several contiguous IP blocks for those website. What a a phenomenal <OPSEC> failure!!!

The easiest way would be if <Wayback Machine> itself had an IP search function, but we couldn't find one: <Search Wayback Machine by IP>.

https://viewdns.info is the only website that <Ciro Santilli> could find that contained such information.

E.g. searching: https://viewdns.info/iphistory[] and considering only hits from 2011 or earlier we obtain:
* capture-nature.com
  * 65.61.127.163 - Greenacres - United States - TierPoint - 2013-10-19
* activegaminginfo.com
  * 66.175.106.148 - United States - Verizon Business - 2012-03-03
* iraniangoals.com
  * 68.178.232.100 - United States - GoDaddy.com - 2011-11-13
  * 69.65.33.21 - Flushing - United States - GigeNET - 2011-09-08
* rastadirect.net
  * 68.178.232.100 - United States - GoDaddy.com - 2011-05-02
* iraniangoalkicks.com
  * 68.178.232.100 - United States - GoDaddy.com - 2011-04-04
* headlines2day.com
  * 118.139.174.1 - Singapore - Web Hosting Service - 2013-06-30
* fightwithoutrules.com
  * 204.11.56.25 - British Virgin Islands - Confluence Networks Inc - 2013-09-26
  * 208.91.197.19 - British Virgin Islands - Confluence Networks Inc - 2013-05-20
  * 212.4.17.38 - Milan - Italy - MCI Worldcom Italy Spa - 2012-03-03
* fitness-dawg.com
  * 219.90.62.243 - Taiwan - Verizon Taiwan Co. Limited - 2012-01-11

Neither of these seem to be in the same ranges, the only common nearby hit amongst these ranges is the exact `68.178.232.100`, and doing reverse IP search at https://viewdns.info/reverseip/?host=68.178.232.100&t=1 states that it has 2.5 million hostnames associated to it, so it must be some kind of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service[Shared web hosting service], see also: https://superuser.com/questions/577070/is-it-possible-for-many-domain-names-to-share-one-ip-address[], which makes search hard.

Ciro then tried some of the other IPs, and soon hit gold.

Initially, Ciro started by doing manual queries to viewdns.info/reversip until his IP was blocked. Then he cread an account and used his 250 free queries with the following helper script: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh]. The output of that script can be seen at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh[].

Ciro then found <2013 DNS Census> which contained data highly disjoint form the viewdns-info one!

Summaries of the IP range exploration done so far follows, comabined data from all databases above.

* +2 65.61.127.165: travelconnectionsonline.com. Ciro initially though this might be a hit. But upon Googling it, there's now a mirror at: https://travelconn.tripod.com/[]. Combined with the lack of a standard communications mechanism and the 2001 copyright, maybe it isn't a hit after all

= Searching for Carson
{parent=Methodology}

The fact that Reuters has a screenshot of it, and therefore a <Wayback Machine> link, plus the specificity of the website topic, will likely keep Ciro awake at night for a while until someone finds that domain.

Some text visible on the Reuters screenshot:
* \Q[Johnny Carson and The Tonight Show]
* \Q[Your Favorite Host and Comedic Genius]
* \Q[Submit Your Favorite Carson Moment]
* \Q[Heeere's Johnny!]. Holy crap, the "Here's Johnny" line from The Shining (1980) is a reference to Johnny Carson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDpipB4yehk[], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYnyPAkgyvc[], Ciro never knew that... but every American would have understood it at the time.
It is unclear however if this text is plaintext or part of a an image.

Some failed attempts, either dry guesses or from DNS dataset searches:

* http://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/carsonified.com

Searching the <Wayback Machine> proved fruitless. There is no full text search: <Wayback Machine full text search>, and a heuristic https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/Johnny%20Carson search has relevant hits but not the one we want.

Another attempt was to search for "carson" on webmasterhome.cn which lists expired domains in bulk by expiration day, and it search engine friendly. It contains most of the domains we've found so far. <Google> either doesn't support partial word search or requires you to be a <God> to find it
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73371842/how-to-run-partial-word-search-on-google-com-and-find-all-words-containing-joh
* https://booleanstrings.com/2021/03/07/how-to-google-for-partial-words-in-urls-osint/
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28220652/google-custom-search-engine-and-partial-matching
so we settle for DuckDuckGo which supports it: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Awebmasterhome.cn+%22carson%22&t=h_&ia=web Adding years also helps: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Awebmasterhome.cn+%22carson%22+2011&ia=web with this we might be getting all possible results. Ciro went through all in 2011, 2012 and 2013 but no luck. Also fuck https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_City,_Nevada[] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California[] :-)

Let's search https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search for "carson" contained in any historic domain name. 10,001 lines. Grepping those, no good Wayback machine hits for those that also contain "johnny" or "show". Data at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/media/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/tools.whoisxmlapi.com_reverse-whois-search_carson.csv in case anyone want to try and dig...

Let's also search the fortuitously timed <2013 DNS Census>.

= 2013 DNS Census
{parent=Methodology}

https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/1951/dataset-of-domain-names/21077#21077

Only the following IP-range domain hits were present in the census for some reason:
``
com.txt:capture-nature.com
com.txt:dedrickonline.com
com.txt:fightwithoutrules.com
com.txt:headlines2day.com
com.txt:pangawana.com
``
However, the IP ranges are extremely valuable, and provided perfectly correct data.

The timing of the database is perfect for this project, it is as if the CIA had planted it themselves.

= Reverse engineering
{parent=Methodology}

In this section we document the outcomes of more detailed inspection of both the communication mechanisms (<JavaScript>, <JAR (file format)>, swf) and HTML that might help to better fingerprint the websites.

= CGI comms
{parent=Reverse engineering}

We've come across a few shallow and stylistically similar websites on suspicious ranges with this pattern.

No JS/JAR/SWF comms, but rather a subdomain, and an HTTPS CGI login link to it. Some names seen for this subdomain:
* `secure.`: most common
* `ssl.`: also common
* various other more creative ones linked to the website theme itself, e.g.:
  * musical-fortune.net has a backstage.musical-fortune.net

The question is, is this part of some legitimate tooling that created such patterns? And if so which? Or are they actual hits with a new comms mechanism not previously seen?

The fact that:
* hits of this type are so dense in the suspicious ranges
* they are so stylistically similar between on another
* citizenlabs specifically mentioned a "CGI" comms method
suggests to Ciro that they are an actual hit.

Also, this is the only occurrence of HTTPS, so it might open up the door for a certificate fingerprint as proposed by user joelcollinsdc at: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36280801[]!

https://crt.sh/?q=globalnewsbulletin.com has a hit to: https://crt.sh/?id=774803[]. With login we can see: https://search.censys.io/certificates/5078bce356a8f8590205ae45350b27f58f4ac04478ed47a389a55b539065cee8[]. Issued by https://www.thawte.com/repository/index.html[]. No hits for certificates with same public key: https://search.censys.io/search?resource=certificates&q=parsed.subject_key_info.fingerprint_sha256%3A+714b4a3e8b2f555d230a92c943ced4f34b709b39ed590a6a230e520c273705af[] or any other "same" queries though.

Let's try another one for secure.altworldnews.com: https://search.censys.io/certificates/e88f8db87414401fd00728db39a7698d874dbe1ae9d88b01c675105fabf69b94[]. Nope, no direct mega hits here either.

= JavaScript reverse engineering
{parent=Reverse engineering}

= iraniangoals.com JavaScript reverse engineering
{parent=JavaScript reverse engineering}

<JavaScript> file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091909/http://iraniangoals.com/journal.js

Some <reverse engineering> was done at: https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/1575505438111571969?lang=en[].

Notably, the password is hardcoded and its <hash> is stored in the JavaScript itself. The result is then submitted back via a POST request to `/cgi-bin/goal.cgi`.

= feedsdemexicoyelmundo.com JavaScript reverse engineering
{parent=JavaScript reverse engineering}

The <JavaScript> of each website appears to be quite small and similarly sized. They are all minimized, but have reordered things around a bit.

For example consider: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202190932/http://feedsdemexicoyelmundo.com/mundo.js

First we have to know that the <Wayback Machine> adds some stuff before and after the original code. The actual code there starts at:
``
ap={fg:['MSXML2.XMLHTTP
``
and ends in:
``
ck++;};return fu;};
``

We can use a <JavaScript> beautifier such as https://beautifier.io/ to be abe to better read the code.

It is worth noting that there's a lot of `<script>` tags inline as well, which seem to matter.

Further analysis would be needed.

= Google searches for known domains and IPs
{c}
{parent=Methodology}

Googling most domains gives only very few results, and most of them are just useless lists of expired domains. Skipping those for now.

Googling `"dedrickonline.com"` has a git at https://www.webwiki.de/dedrickonline.com# Furthermore, it also contains the IP address "65.61.127.174" under the "Technik" tab!

Unfortunately that website appears to be split by language? E.g. the English version does not contain it: https://www.webwiki.com/dedrickonline.com[], which would make searching a bit harder, but still doable.

But if we can Google search those IPs there, we might just hit gold.

IP search did work! https://www.webwiki.de/65.61.127.174

But doesn't often/ever work unfortunately for others.

Googling "activegaminginfo.com" has a git at: http://cqcounter.com/whois/site/activegaminginfo.com.html which actually contains the IP 66.175.106.148! But I can't find a reverse IP search method. And perhaps due to having lots of <CAPTCHAs>, Google doesn't seem to index that website very well... it even has a tiny screenshot! And it also shows some more metadata beyond IP, e.g. HTTP response headers, which notably contain stuff like `Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1`.

Forward search of expired domains appears to often work however, and contains correct IPs and the screenshots. Note that direct access as follows does not work for some reason, you have to type them into the search bar manually:
* https://cqcounter.com/siteinfo/?activegaminginfo.com/

OMG so close. If only Google would index that website we'd be done!!!

Searching on github.com: https://github.com/DrWhax/cia-website-comms from September 2022 contains some of the links to some of the ones reported by Reuters.

= Breakthroughs
{parent=CIA 2010 covert communication websites}

Some less-trivial breakthroughs:
* <2013 DNS Census>
* <CGI comms> characterization
* <The first non Reuters ranges>
* TODO confirm: https://commoncrawl.org/[]. This could be THE one.

= The first non Reuters ranges
{parent=Breakthroughs}

Grepping the <2013 DNS Census> first by overused <CGI comms> subdomains `secure.` and `ssl.` leaves 200k lines. Grepping for the overused "news" led to hits:
* secure.worldnewsandent.com,2012-02-13T21:28:15,208.254.40.117
* ssl.beyondnetworknews.com,2012-02-13T20:10:13,66.104.175.40

Also tried `sports`: http://web.archive.org/web/20110501000000*/motorsportdealers.com[] but no luck:
* secure.motorsportdealers.com,2012-04-10T20:19:09,64.73.117.38

= Wakatime redirects
{c}
{parent=CIA 2010 covert communication websites}

As raised at: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36280666[], many, but not all, of the domains currently redirect to https://wakatime.com/[] as of 2023, and apparently they were taken up in 2013 (TODO how to confirm that). TODO what is the explanation for that? Some examples that do:
* http://dedrickonline.com
* http://tee-shot.net
But some failed resolution examples:
* http://pangawana.com/
* http://kessingerssportsnews.com/
Even more suspiciously, according to his LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanhamlett/[], the owner of Wakatime, Alan Hamlett, worked at WhiteHat Security, Inc from Aug 2011 - Sep 2013. The company was then acquired by Synopsys in 2022. Holy crap!!! As shown at: https://web.archive.org/web/20131013193406/https://www.whitehatsec.com/ that company made website security tools. Did that dude use the tools to find the vulnerabilty and then just gobble up all the domains??? What a fucking legend if he did!!!

Let's try:
* https://host.io/redirects/wakatime.com[]: failure
* https://www.whatsmydns.net/redirect-checker?q=wakatime.com[]: failure
* https://app.neilpatel.com/en/seo_analyzer/backlinks?domain=wakatime.com&mode=domain[]: failure

Running e.g.
``
curl -vvv dedrickonline.com
``
gives:
``
*   Trying 162.255.119.197:80...

So these suggest Alan might have just come along in 2023 way after the 2022 Reuters article and did the same basic IP range search that Ciro is doing now, so possibly no new tech. Let's ask... https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1668369786865164289

The domain name history presented is however of interest, and could lead to patterns being found.

Searching https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search with term "Corral, Elizabeth" gave no results unfortunately.

Basic search under https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search for "Corral" also empty. They can't see their own data? Ah, need advanced. Marked "Historic" and selected "Corral, Elizabeth", ony one hit, activegaminginfo.com.
