This article is about <cutout (espionage)>[covert agent communication channel] websites used by the <CIA> in many countries from the late 2000s until the early 2010s, when they were uncovered by <counter intelligence> of the targeted countries circa 2010-2013.

This article uses publicly available information to publicly disclose for the first time a few hundred of what we feel are extremely likely candidate sites of the network. The starting point for this research was the <Reuters article>[September 2022 Reuters article "America’s Throwaway Spies"] which for the first time gave <The Reuters websites>[nine example websites], and their https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/[analyst from Citizenlabs claims to have found 885 websites] in total, but did not publicly disclose them. Starting from only the nine disclosed websites, we were then able to find a few hundred websites that share so many similarities with them, i.e. a common <fingerprint>, that we believe makes them beyond reasonable doubt part of the same network.

The discovery of these websites by <Iranian> and <Chinese> counterintelligence led to the imprisonment and execution of several assets in those countries, and subsequent shutdown of the channel by the CIA when they noticed that things had gone wrong. This is likely a Wikipedia page that talks about the disastrous outcome of the websites being found out: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%932012_killing_of_CIA_sources_in_China[2010–2012 killing of CIA sources in China], although it contained no mention of websites before <Ciro Santilli> edited it in.

Of particular interest is that based on their language and content, certain of the websites seem to have <USA spying on its own allies>[targeted other democracies such as Germany, France, Spain and Brazil].

If anyone can find others websites, or has better techniques feel free to contact <Ciro Santilli> at: <contact>{full}. Contributions will be clearly attributed if desired. Some of the techniques used so far have been very heuristic, and that added to the limited amount of data makes it almost certain that some websites have been missed. Broadly speaking, there are two types of contributions that would be possible:
* finding new IP ranges: harder and more exiting, and potentially requires more intelligence
* better IP to domain name databases to <Find missing hits in IP ranges>[fill in known gaps in existing IP ranges]
The fact that https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/[citizenlabs reported exactly 885 websites being found] makes it feel like they might have found find a better fingerprint which we have not managed to find yet. We have not yet had to pay for our data.

Disclaimers:
* the network fell in 2013, followed by fully public disclosures in 2018 and 2022, so we believe it is now more than safe for the public to know what can still be uncovered about the events that took place
* <Ciro Santilli>'s political bias is <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[strongly pro-democracy and anti-dictatorship], but with a good pinch of skepticism about the morality US foreign policy in the last century

May this article serve as a tribute to those who spent their days making, using, and uncovering these websites under the shadows.

The existence of the websites emerged in various stages, some of which may refer to this network or to other closely related communications failure since the published information is sometimes not clear enough.

\b[May 21, 2011]: various Iranian news outlets reported that:
> 30 individual suspected of spying for the US were arrested and 42 CIA operatives were identified in connection with the network.

  The network, which was set up by a considerable number of seasoned CIA operatives in several countries, attempted to trick citizens into spying for them under the guise of issuing visa, helping with permanent residency, and making job and study offers.
Iranian sources include:
* https://web.archive.org/web/20110729150642/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/180976.html "Iran dismantles US-linked spy network by Press TV (English, quoted above)
* https://web.archive.org/web/20110527084527/https://www.mehrnews.ir/NewsPrint.aspx?NewsID=1316973 "CIA spy network dismantled/30 American spies arrested" by Mehr news (Farsi)
* https://shiatv.net/video/dd6ee2d708a4a6cb2429 "Iran dismantles US-linked spy network" broadcast by IRIB, the main Iranian public broadcaster
The news were picked up and repeated by Western outlets on the same day e.g.:
* https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/babylon-beyond/story/2011-05-21/iran-intelligence-ministry-claims-to-arrest-30-alleged-cia-spies "Intelligence Ministry claims to arrest 30 alleged CIA spies" by the Los Angeles Times
At this point there were still no clear indications that the recruitment had been made with websites, however later revelations would later imply that.

Quite prophetically, this was on the same day that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_end_times_prediction[Christian radio broadcaster Harold Camping predicted that the world would come to an end].

Even heavily redacted, the few unredacted snippets of the appeal are pure gold and give a little bit of insight into the internal workings of the CIA. Some selections:

\b[May 2017]: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/world/asia/china-cia-spies-espionage.html[the New York Times reported at "Killing C.I.A. Informants, China Crippled U.S. Spying Operations" that]:

\b[January 2018]: Pete Williams reported for NCB News on https://www.nbcnews.com/news/china/cia-china-turncoat-lee-may-have-compromised-u-s-spies-n839316[Alleged CIA China turncoat Lee may have compromised U.S. spies in Russia too] that it was China that told Russia about the communications system:
> It was a shocking blow to an American spy agency that prides itself on its field operations. There was also a devastating human cost: Some 20 CIA sources were executed by the Chinese government, two former officials said — a higher number of dead than initially reported by NBC News and the New York Times. Then an unknown number of Russian assets also disappeared, sources say.
> Soon after the task force concluded the Chinese had penetrated covcom, it got an even more troubling report: That after a joint training session between Chinese and Russian intelligence officers, the Russians "came back saying we got good info on covcom," as the former official put it
and that some theorize that former CIA agent Jerry Chun Shing Lee had betrayed Chinese spies, which some theorize may have been how China became aware of the communication network:
> FBI agents began to suspect Lee after they received a tip that he had passed information to Chinese intelligence officers while working for a Japanese tobacco company in Hong Kong, sources said, a detail first reported Thursday by the New York Times. They also found it suspicious when Lee took a job at an auction house in Hong Kong that was co-owned by a senior Communist Party official, sources said. He eventually ended up working for Christie's, the international auction house.

  When agents searched Lee's hotel rooms in 2012, they found notebooks with the names of covert CIA sources, according to court documents.

  But not all of the agent arrests and deaths could be linked to information possessed by Lee, who left the CIA in 2007, the former officials said.
According to https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/politics/jerry-lee-china-spying.html[Ex-C.I.A. Officer Sentenced to 19 Years in Chinese Espionage Conspiracy] from November 2019 Lee was sentenced to 19 years in prison:
> The former officer, Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 55, pleaded guilty in May to conspiring with Chinese intelligence agents starting in 2010, after he left the agency. Prosecutors detailed a long financial paper trail that they said showed that Mr. Lee received more than \$840,000 for his work.

  Mr. Lee, an Army veteran, worked for the C.I.A. from 1994 to 2007, including in China. 
> But F.B.I. agents who investigated whether he was the culprit passed on an opportunity to arrest him in the United States in 2013, allowing him to travel back to Hong Kong even after finding classified information in his luggage. F.B.I. agents had also covertly entered a hotel room Mr. Lee occupied in 2012, finding handwritten notes detailing the names and numbers of at least eight C.I.A. sources that he had handled in his capacity as a case officer.

\b[August 2018]: Zach Dorfman reported for Foreign Policy at https://web.archive.org/web/20180902002821/https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/15/botched-cia-communications-system-helped-blow-cover-chinese-agents-intelligence/["Botched CIA Communications System Helped Blow Cover of Chinese Agents" that]:
> It was considered one of the CIA’s worst failures in decades: Over a two-year period starting in late 2010, Chinese authorities systematically dismantled the agency’s network of agents across the country, executing dozens of suspected U.S. spies. But since then, a question has loomed over the entire debacle. How were the Chinese able to roll up the network?
and:
> U.S. intelligence officers were also able to identify digital links between the covert communications system and the U.S. government itself, according to one former official—links the Chinese agencies almost certainly found as well. These digital links would have made it relatively easy for China to deduce that the covert communications system was being used by the CIA. In fact, some of these links pointed back to parts of the CIA’s own website, according to the former official.
Although no clear mention of websites is made in that article, the fact that there were "links" back to the CIA website strongly suggests that the communication was done through websites.

The report also reveals that there was a temporary "interim system" that new sources would use while they were being vetted, but that it used the same style of system as the main system. It would be cool if we managed to identify which sites are interim or not somehow:
> When CIA officers begin working with a new source, they often use an interim covert communications system—in case the person turns out to be a double agent.
  
  The communications system used in China during this period was internet-based and accessible from laptop or desktop computers, two of the former officials said.
  
  This interim, or “throwaway,” system, an encrypted digital program, allows for remote communication between an intelligence officer and a source, but it is also separated from the main communications system used with vetted sources, reducing the risk if an asset goes bad.
  
  Although they used some of the same coding, the interim system and the main covert communication platform used in China at this time were supposed to be clearly separated.

{source=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/15/botched-cia-communications-system-helped-blow-cover-chinese-agents-intelligence}

\b[November 2018]: Zach Dorfman and Jenna McLaughlin reported for Yahoo News the first clear report that the communication system was made up of websites at: https://www.yahoo.com/video/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html["The CIA's communications suffered a catastrophic compromise. It started in Iran."]:
> In 2013, hundreds of CIA officers — many working nonstop for weeks — scrambled to contain a disaster of global proportions: a compromise of the agency’s internet-based covert communications system used to interact with its informants in dark corners around the world. Teams of CIA experts worked feverishly to take down and reconfigure the websites secretly used for these communications

The usage of of Google dorking is then mentioned:
> In fact, the Iranians used Google to identify the website the CIA was using to communicate with agents.
It seems to us that this would have been very difficult on the generically themed websites that we have found so far. This suggests the existence of a separate recruitment website network, perhaps the one reported in 2011 by Iran offering VISAs. It would be plausible that such network could link back to the CIA and other government websites. Recruited agents would only then later use the comms network to send information back. The target countries may have first found the recruitment network, and then injected double agents into it, who later came to know about the comms network. TODO: it would be awesome to find some of those recruitment websites!

Another very interesting mention is the platform had been over extended beyond its original domain application, which is in part why things went so catastrophically bad:
> Former U.S. officials said the internet-based platform, which was first used in war zones in the Middle East, was not built to withstand the sophisticated counterintelligence efforts of a state actor like China or Iran. “It was never meant to be used long term for people to talk to sources,” said one former official. “The issue was that it was working well for too long, with too many people. But it was an elementary system.”

{title=Illustration in the Yahoo article}
{source=https://www.yahoo.com/video/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html}

\b[December 2018]: a followup Yahoo News article "At the CIA, a fix to communications system that left trail of dead agents remains elusive" gives an interesting internal organizational overview of the failed operation:
> As a result, many who are directly responsible for working with sources on the ground within the CIA’s Directorate of Operations are furious
> The fiascos in Iran and China continue to be sticking points between the Directorate of Operations and the CIA’s Directorate of Science and Technology (DS&T) — the technical scientists. “There is a disconnect between the two directorates,” said one former CIA official. “I’m not sure that will be fixed anytime soon.”
> Entire careers in the CIA’s Office of Technical Service — the part of DS&T directly responsible for developing covert communications systems — were built on these internet-based systems, said a former senior official. Raising concerns about them was “like calling someone’s baby ugly,” said this person.
Much as in the case of Reidy, it is partly because of such internal dissatisfaction that so much has come out to the press, as agents feel that they have nowhere else to turn to.

That article also gives a cute insight into the <OPSEC> guidelines for the assets that used the websites:
> CIA agents using the system were supposed to conduct “electronic surveillance detection routes” — that is, to bounce around on various sites on the internet before accessing the system, in order to cover their tracks — but often failed to do so, creating potentially suspicious patterns of internet usage, said this person.

Finally the article also gives us a cute terminology: COVCOM:
> “And the agency would produce its own COVCOM \[covert communications\] systems in-house. We’d test it there. In denied areas, we had special systems.”

\b[29 September 2022]: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran/[Reuters reported nine specific websites of the network at "America's Throwaway Spies"], henceforth known only as "the <Reuters article>" in this article.

The most important thing that this article gave were screenshots of nine websites, including the domain names of two of them: iraniangoals.com and iraniangoalkicks.com:
> In addition, some sites bore strikingly similar names. For example, while Hosseini was communicating with the CIA through Iraniangoals.com, a site named Iraniangoalkicks.com was built for another informant. At least two dozen of the 350-plus sites produced by the CIA appeared to be messaging platforms for Iranian operatives, the analysts found.
The "350-plus" number is a bit random, given that their own analysts stated a much higher 885 in their report.

The article also reveals the critical flaw of the system; the usage of sequential IPs:
> Online records they analyzed reveal the hosting space for these front websites was often purchased in bulk by the dozen, often from the same internet providers, on the same server space. The result was that numerical identifiers, or IP addresses, for many of these websites were sequential, much like houses on the same street.

It also mentions that other countries besides Iran and Chine were also likely targeted:
> This vulnerability went far beyond Iran. Written in various languages, the websites appeared to be a conduit for CIA communications with operatives in at least 20 countries, among them China, Brazil, Russia, Thailand and Ghana, the analysts found.

\b[29 September 2022]: on the same day that Reuters published their report, Citizenlab, which Reuters used as analysts for the article, https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/[also simultaneously published their more technical account of things at "Statement on the fatal flaws found in a defunct CIA covert communications system"].

One of the most important information given in that report is the large number of sites found, 885, and the fact that they are available on <Wayback Machine>:
> Using only a single website, as well as publicly available material such as historical internet scanning results and the <Internet Archive>'s <Wayback Machine>, we identified a network of 885 websites and have high confidence that the United States (US) Central Intelligence Agency (<CIA>) used these sites for covert communication.
The million dollar question is "which website did they use" and "how much does it cost if anything" since our investigation has so far had to piece together a few different hacky sources but didn't spend any money. And a lot of money could be poured into this, e.g. <DomainTools> which might contain one of the largest historical databases seems to start at 15k USD / 1000 queries. One way to try and deduce which website they used is to look through their other research, e.g.:
* https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/ uses Censys, and it notably has historical data:
  > We searched historical data from Censys
* https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/ mentions https://scans.io/[]
* https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/running-in-circles-uncovering-the-clients-of-cyberespionage-firm-circles/ mentions: https://www.shodan.io/[]

The article mentioned the different types of <communication mechanisms> found:
> The websites included similar <Java>, <JavaScript>, <Adobe Flash>, and <CGI> artifacts that implemented or apparently loaded covert communications apps. In addition, blocks of sequential IP addresses registered to apparently fictitious US companies were used to host some of the websites. All of these flaws would have facilitated discovery by hostile parties.

They describe the most common subject matters and language of the websites:
> The websites, which purported to be news, weather, sports, healthcare, and other legitimate websites, appeared to be localized to at least 29 languages and geared towards at least 36 countries.

They also give the dates range in which the system was active, which is very helpful for better targeting our searches:
> The bulk of the websites that we discovered were active at various periods between 2004 and 2013.

And then a bomb, they claim to have found information regarding specific officers:
> Nevertheless, a subset of the websites are linked to individuals who may be former and possibly still active intelligence community employees or assets:
  * Several are currently abroad
  * Another left mainland China in the time frame of the Chinese crackdown
  * Another was subsequently employed by the US State Department
  * Another now works at a foreign intelligence contractor
  Given that we cannot rule out ongoing risks to CIA employees or assets, we are not publishing full technical details regarding our process of mapping out the network at this time. As a first step, we intend to conduct a limited disclosure to <US Government> oversight bodies.
This basically implies that they must have either
* <= IP and DNS metadata>[found some communication layer] level identifier, e.g. <domain name> registration HTTPS certificate certificate because it is impossible to believe that real agent names would have been present on the website content itself!
* or they may be instead talking about a separate recruitment network which offered the VISAs which we conjecture might have existed but currently have no examples of, and which might conceivably contain real embassy contacts
We have so for not yet found any such clear references to real individuals.

\b[October 2022] Zach Dorfman, author of the 2018 Yahoo News article, gave some good personal notes after the Reuters expose in his personal blog post https://thebrushpass.projectbrazen.com/covcom-iran-china-cia/[On Agent Compromise in the Field]:
> Now, an important caveat: I have known dedicated former CIA officials who have spoken of the care, respect, and obligation they felt toward their sources, and the lengths they would go to assist them. For many case officers — that is, the CIA's primary corps of spy handlers — this is a core part of their professional identity.  

  During the roll-up in China, for instance, a former U.S. official told me about a CIA officer who, aware that something was going terribly wrong there, organized final, assuredly dangerous, in-person meetings with agency sources. This distraught CIA officer essentially shoved wads of cash into sources' hands. This CIA officer warned them of the unfolding disaster and begged them to leave the country as fast as they could. Another source told me a story about a CIA official who, while being debriefed in Langley about the asset roll-up — and the slapdash COVCOM system — broke down in tears upon hearing that sources’ lives had been destroyed because of such obvious dereliction, of which they were previously unaware.
> But I don’t want to oversell this point, either. By its nature, the world of espionage is steeped in the sordid aspects of human experience, exploiting people’s vulnerabilities for narrow informational gain. \[...\]

  Indeed, many former CIA officials have a decidedly pragmatic and amoral conception of their profession. Bad things happen when you spy, or recruit others to do so. \[...\] I had a conversation once with a former senior CIA official with experience in Iran issues who had an almost naturalistic view of recurring asset losses there over the years: for him, it was a built-in, cyclical feature of the work and environment, like the denuding of deciduous forests every fall.

In 2023, one year after the Reuters article had been published, <Ciro Santilli> was killing some time on <YouTube> when he saw a curious video: <video Compromised Comms by Darknet Diaries (2023)>. As soon as he understood what it was about and that it was likely related to the previously undisclosed websites that he was interested in, he went on to read the <Reuters article> that the podcast pointed him to.

Being a <OurBigBook.com>[half-arsed web developer himself], Ciro knows that the <attack surface> of a website is about the <Size of Texas meme>[size of Texas], and the potential for <fingerprinting (cybersecurity)> is off the charts with so many bits and pieces sticking out. And given that there were at least 885 of them, surely we should be able to find a few more than nine, right?

In particular, it is fun how these websites provide to anyone "live" examples of the <USA spying on its own allies> in the form of <Wayback Machine> archives.

Given all of this, <Ciro Santilli's naughty projects>[Ciro knew he had to try] and find some of the domains himself using the newly available information! It was an irresistible real-life <capture the flag (cybersecurity)>. 

Chris, get fucked.

{title=Compromised Comms by Darknet Diaries (2023)}
{description=
It was the <YouTube> suggestion for this video that made <Ciro Santilli> aware of the <Reuters article> almost one year after its publication, which kickstarted his research on the topic.

Full podcast transcript: https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/75/

https://x.com/cirosantilli/status/1900278353065894324[Ciro Santilli pinged the Podcast's host Jack Rhysider on Twitter] and he ACK'ed which is cool, though he was skeptical about the strength of the fingerprints found, and didn't reply when clarification was offered. Perhaps the material is just not impactful enough for him to produce any new content based on it. Or also perhaps it comes too close to <sources and methods> for his own good as a presumably American citizen.
}

The first step was to try and obtain the domain names of <the Reuters websites>[all nine websites that Reuters had highlighted] as they had only given two domains explicitly.

Thankfully however, either by carelessness or intentionally, this was easy to do by inspecting the address of the screenshots provided. For example, one of the URLs was:
``
https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/usa-spies-iran/screencap-activegaminginfo.com.jpg?v=192516290922
``
which corresponds to `activegaminginfo.com`.

{title=Inspecting the <Reuters article> HTML source code}
{description=The <Reuters article> only gave one URL explicitly: <iraniangoals.com>. But most others could be found by inspecting the HTML of the screenshots provided, except for <Searching for Carson>[the Carson website].}
{height=600}
{source=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran/}

Once we had this, we were then able to inspect the websites on the <Wayback Machine> to better understand possible <fingerprints> such as their <communication mechanism>.

The next step was to use our knowledge of the sequential IP flaw to look for more neighbor websites to the nine we knew of.

This was not so easy to do because the websites are down and so it requires historical data. But for our luck we found <viewdns.info> which allowed for 200 free historical queries (and they seem to have since removed this hard limit and moved to only throttling), leading to the discovery or some or our own new domains!

This gave us a larger website sample size in the order of the tens, which allowed us to better grasp more of the possible different styles of website and have a much better idea of what a good <fingerprint> would look like.

\Image[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/media/master/viewdns.info_activegameinfo.com_domain_to_IP_arrow.png]
{title=<viewdns.info> `activegameinfo.com` domain to IP}

{source=https://viewdns.info/iphistory/?domain=activegaminginfo.com}

{title=<viewdns.info> `aroundthemiddleeast.com` IP to domain}
{height=550}
{source=https://viewdns.info/reverseip/?host=66.175.106.140&t=1}

The next major and difficult step would be to find new IP ranges.

This was and still is a hacky heuristic process for us, but we've had the most success with the following methods:
* step 1) get huge lists of historic domain names. The two most valuable sources so far have been:
  * <2013 DNS Census>
  * scraping <expired domain trackers>
* step 2) filter the domain lists down somehow to a more manageable number of domains. The most successful heuristics have been:
  * for <2013 DNS Census> which has IPs, check that they are the only domain in a given IP, which was the case for the majority of CIA websites, but was already not so common for legitimate websites
  * they have the word `news` on the domain name, given that so many of the websites were fake news aggregators
* step 3) search on Wayback machine if any of those filtered domains contain URL's that could be those of a <communication mechanism>. In particular, we've used <Wayback Machine CDX scanning with Tor parallelization>[a small army of Tor bots] to overcome the Wayback Machine's IP throttling and greatly increase our checking capacity

The <Star Wars> one. Clearly branded websites like this are rare, which makes finding them all the much more fun. The <Reuters article> had two of them (<Searching for Carson>[Carson] and rastadirect.net), so these were probably manually selected from the full hit dataset, and did not serve specifically as entry points. Most of the websites are quite boring and forgetful as you'd expect.

The subtitle "Beyond The Unknown" may be a reference to the https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_Regions[Unknown Regions], an unexplored area of the galaxy in the Star Wars fictional universe.

Marked as Uploaded 10 October, 2008.

The photo can still be licensed today as of 2025: https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/photo/little-jedi-royalty-free-image/172984439[]. We found it by https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/search/2/image?phrase=jedi%20boy&sort=best&license=rf%2Crm[searching for "jedi boy" on gettyimages.co.uk]. The photo is credited to a `madisonwi`, presumably an alias based on the location <#Madison, Wisconsin>. Here's a random website about adoption that uses it: https://www.adoptionadvocates.net/star-wars-adoption-language/ and where it can be seen without the watermarks.

The droids can be seen e.g. at: https://www.amazon.co.uk/04-Kampf-Droiden-Superheftig-Jedi/dp/B004TINSW6[], a promotional material for a 2008 The Clone Wars television series audio CD and available as transparent PNGs without background in several sources. The Yoda art also seems to come from that show: https://rpggamer.org/page.php?page=4229[]. One can picture the contractor's children watching that show when a lightbulb popped over their heads.

It later ocurred to <Ciro Santilli> that perhaps Reuters did not showcase this website because it features a minor. But Ciro is sure that that minor is now a handsome young man in his 20's and would find the entire story very amusing if he ever finds out about it!

Ciro couldn't help but feel as if looking through the Eyes of <Sauron> himself!

It is worth noting that democracies represent just a small minority of the websites found. The Middle East, and Spanish language sites (presumably for Venezuela + war on drugs countries?) where the huge majority. But <Americans> have to understand that https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/dictatorships-tend-to-work-together[democracies have to work together and build mutual trust, and not spy on one another]. Even some of the enlightened people from <Hacker News> seem https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36279768[to not grasp this point]. The <USA> cannot single handedly maintain world order as it once could. Collaboration based on trust is the only way.

<Snowden>'s 2013 revelations particularly shocked USA "allies" with the fact that they were being spied upon, and as of the 2020's, everybody knows this and has "stopped caring", and or moved to <end-to-end encryption> by default. This is beautifully illustrated in the <Snowden (film)> when Snowden talks about his time in <Japan> working for <Dell> as an undercover <NSA> operative:
> <NSA> wanted to impress the <Japanese>. Show them our reach. They loved the live video from drones. This is <Pakistan> right now \[video shows CIA agents demonstrating drone footage to Japanese officials\]. They were not as excited about that we wanted their help to spy on the Japanese population. They said it was against their laws.

  We bugged the country anyway, of course.

  And we did not stop there. Once we had their communications we continued with the physical infrastructure. We sneaked into small programs in their power grids, dams, hospitals. The idea was that if Japan one day was not our allies we could turn off the lights.

  And it was not just Japan. We planted software in <Mexico>, <Germany>, <Brazil>, Austria.

  <China>, I can understand. Or <Russia> or <Iran>. Venezuela, okay.

  But Austria? \[shows footage of <cow> on an idyllic <Alpine> mountain grazing field, suggesting that there is nothing in Austria to spy on\]

Another noteworthy scene from that movie is <video Aptitude test on communication networks scene from the 2016 Snowden film>, where a bunch of new <CIA> recruits are told that:
> Each of you is going to build a covert communications network in your home city \[i.e. their fictitious foreign target location written on each person's desk such as Berlin, Istanbul and Bangkok, not necessarily where they were actually born\], you're going to deploy it, backup your site, destroy it, and restore it again.

= List of websites
{parent=Results}

This section contains a list of all the websites that we consider belong to the network beyond reasonable doubt.

The list is also available in <JSON> format at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.json[]. When there are new additions we keep the JSON up to date with the help of the following <OurBigBook Markup> to <JSON> conversion helper \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/bigb-to-json]:
``
cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/bigb-to-json cia-2010-covert-communication-websites.bigb
``
and new results that have been added to the list below can automatically be merged with \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/bigb-to-json-merge]:
``
cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/bigb-to-json-merge > tmp.json
mv tmp.json ../media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.json
``

The main criteria to consider a website as a hit is for it to have a <Wayback Machine> archive with an archived <communication mechanism>. <JS comms> are always quickly visually inspected, other mechanisms we look only at filename patterns for now. We also consider as hits websites that don't have archived comms (often the case for <CGI comms> but which have two ore more of the following supporting evidence:
* shares an IP range with other website
* a Wayback Machine archive or <cqcounter> screenshot strongly confirming visual style
* an archived broken link to the possible comms
Commented edge cases that didn't make the cut can be found mostly under <IP range search>{full} and <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup heuristic keyword searches>{full}.

The split headers have a weird style however `<li><a id="banner1">&nbsp;</a></li>` and then filled with a CSS background image. This is a weird one, there is some chance that it is a legit website in the CIA style. Notably, https://web.archive.org/web/20120829122604/http://globaltourist.net/[at least as of August 2012 it had become a wordpress site] marked "Just another Media Network Online Sites site", which is a bit early. Likely they just watch for good domain drops and take over quickly. The last in-style archive is https://web.archive.org/web/20120301030918/http://www.globaltourist.net:80/[from March 2012], which is first followed by a Godaddy parked domain on https://web.archive.org/web/20120418194608/http://www.globaltourist.net:80/[April 2012]. This domain also has a https://web.archive.org/web/20031221163711/http://globaltourist.net/[2003 archive] which is almost certainly from the same authors as it also has a link to http://globaltourist.net/speed.jar[] and the upper left image is the same. Its history does however remember us of alljohnny.com, which had its 2004 version and then a 2010 rehash. Both of these versions contain `ImageReady Slices` mentions in them, characteristic of the <split header images> fingerprint.

| Split images with `<li><a id="banner1">&nbsp;</a></li>` style. Nice swimsuit ad. The bottom bar "Copyright © 2008 My Nepal News, LLC. All Rights Reserved." is also kind of typical, see e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20110208042144/http://helpinghandssite.com/[], both have `<!-- begin #footer -->` and `<div id="footer">`. https://web.archive.org/web/20110201170354/http://ingenuitytrendz.com/[ingenuitytrendz.com] is another closely related template. One ridiculously mind blowing thing about this website is the presence of Webalizer reports https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://mynepalnews.com/stats/*[under /stats] e.g.: https://web.archive.org/web/20110204095803/http://mynepalnews.com:80/stats/[/stats]. This fact is so mind blowing that it makes us question if this an actual hit or just style coincidence. Particularly ridiculous is the presence of `inurl:cgi server_software` at https://web.archive.org/web/20110204095809/http://mynepalnews.com:80/stats/usage_200805.html which is almost certainly a Google dork search, which we know is something that the Iranians used to find the websites. Also of interest are link backs from at https://web.archive.org/web/20110204095815/http://mynepalnews.com:80/stats/usage_200806.html from http://whois.domaintools.com/mynepalnews.com and http://www.whois.sc/mynepalnews.com That search hits under https://web.archive.org/web/20110204095351/http://mynepalnews.com:80/cgi-bin/check.cgi[/cgi-bin/check.cgi]. That page is itself os some interest containing `SERVER_ADMIN = mmadev@mmadev.com`. https://web.archive.org/web/20110204095815/http://mynepalnews.com:80/stats/usage_200806.html also reveals several request IPs. Even if this is not a CIA website, there's a chance we could find the IP of the Iranian counter-intelligence in these IP list, it's mind blowing. And if legit, we could also find IPs used by CIA handlers to see if the website is working. Lot's of referrer spam too as well.

Same authors given content similarities e.g. "Submit Your Favorite Carson Moment". Reusing the domain after all these years, the lack of OPSEC is just mind blowing! New website marked Copyright 2003.

| No <Wayback Machine> archives. Broken Chinese site as usual for their archives. The headline: "你最好的身体.最好的健康和健身信息" translates as "Your Best Body The best health and fitness information", so we understand that the domain name is a super broken "your best body". Visible is a link to "论坛" (forum), so likely CGI

Features Johnny Carson, Charles Chaplin, Rowan Atkins, The Three Stooges and some other <Americans> no one knows about anymore. There must have been a massive Johnny Carson amongst the CIA contractors at that time given <Searching for Carson>[`alljohnny.com`]! The HTML page is weirdly titled `pg1c`.

= Possible HTML information leaks
{parent=Results}

This section is about possible real-world information leaks found in the HTML of the pages. Domain <IP and DNS metadata>[DNS metadata] may of course expose more, and is more likely to do so, this section is only about in-page findings, notably in the HTML.

We haven found much so far, but the ones we have are curious.

The HTML `<title>` of https://web.archive.org/web/20110207150839/http://webofcheer.com/[webofcheer.com] is cryptically set as:
``
pg1c
``
rather than a more natural title like "Web of cheer" as is the case for the other website. This feels like a forgotten placeholder for an internal page identifier, e.g. "page 1C" sounds plausible. At <HTML title element>{full} we riefly inspected the `<title>` of every other hit with a wayback machine archive, and unfortunately none other seemed to have any such interesting title.

The https://web.archive.org/web/20100724024623/http://www.europeantravelcafe.com/[2010 archive of europeantravelcafe.com] has a "plan your trip" link links to a different domain: https://secure-cert.net/~etc/transport.html[]. This appears to have been a link to the system used by CIA operators to manage the website. Furthermore, the link then was later https://web.archive.org/web/20110201192245/http://europeantravelcafe.com/[removed from the 2011 version], so it was almost certainly a leak! "secure-cert.net" is obscure, the only other surviving online mention of it is https://www.leewillis.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/#comment-6513[] to 
http://secure-cert.net/~sayitint/products-page/bags-totes/duffel-bag/ We've grepped all the HTML downloaded as <HTML analysis> but no other links to it were found.

\Image[https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/screenshots/www.europeantravelcafe.com-arrow.jpg?raw=true]
{title=2010 <Wayback Machine> archive of https://web.archive.org/web/20100724024623/http://www.europeantravelcafe.com/[www.europeantravelcafe.com] with "plan your trip" highlighted by us}
{height=1024}
{source=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724024623/http://www.europeantravelcafe.com/}

Starting https://web.archive.org/web/20041215182457/http://alljohnny.com/index.html[December 2004] the "Submit your favorid carlson quote" was mind blowingly switched to point to https://web.archive.org/web/20050328224840/https://washington.serversecured.net/~alljohnn/cgi-bin/memlog.cgi[\https://washington.serversecured.net/~alljohnn/cgi-bin/memlog.cgi] thus likely leaking the control site URL. Beauty. It previously pointed to the more sensible: https://web.archive.org/web/20040901162621/https://secure.alljohnny.com/cgi-bin/memlog.cgi[]

A similar thing happened to alljohnny.com

A few separate websites have an archive with the same `pid` parameter:
``
fightwithoutrules.com/20131220205811/?pid=2POQ7BC1G/index.html
half-court.net/20131223165013/?pid=2POQ7BC1G/index.html
health-men-today.com/20131223002237/?pid=2POQ7BC1G/index.html
intlnewsdaily.com/20131221121441/?pid=2POQ7BC1G/index.html
intoworldnews.com/20131217193621/?pid=2POQ7BC1G/index.html
``
It is unclear what it means. All of them contain something like:
``
<html>
<head>
<meta name="robots" content="noarchive" />
<meta name="googlebot" content="nosnippet" />
</head>
<body>
<div align=center>
<h3>Error. Page cannot be displayed. Please contact your service provider for more details.  (11)</h3>
</div>
</body>
</html>
``
so looks like an archival artifact only.

The following two websites have a `feeds.php` system for their RSS:
``
./mydailynewsreport.com/20110211111053/myrss/feeds.php?src=http:/www.refahemelli.com/pashto/news/rss.php&chan=y&desc=1&targ=y&utf=y

``

The <Reuters article> directly reported only two domains in writing:
* http://iraniangoals.com[]. Iranian language <football> website. As of 2023, the domain had been bought by Reuters and redirects to their website.

  2009 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20090411072857/http://iraniangoals.com/

  <Java> <JAR (file format)> file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091917/http://iraniangoalkicks.com/clamping.jar

But by looking at the URLs of the screenshots they provided from other websites we can easily uncover all others that had screenshots, <Searching for Carson>[except for the Johnny Carson one], which is just generically named. E.g. the image for the Chinese one is https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/usa-spies-iran/screencap-activegaminginfo.com.jpg?v=192516290922 which leads us to domain http://activegaminginfo.com[].

<Oleg Shakirov> later discovered that the Carson one had its domain written right on the screenshot, as part of a watermark present on the original website itself. Therefore the URLs of all the websites were in one way or another essentially given on the article.

The full list of domains from screenshots is:
* `activegaminginfo.com`: <Chinese (language)> gaming information website.

  2011 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20110208113503/http://activegaminginfo.com/[]. Contains mentions of 2010.

  2011 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20110201104659/http://capture-nature.com/[].

  As of 2023, it seemed to be an actual legit <photography> website by German (amateur?) photographer Klaus Wägele. Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20230323102504/https://www.capture-nature.com/

  <Ciro Santilli> actually sent him a message to let him know about the <CIA> thing in case he didn't, and he replied that he wasn't aware of it.

= Fingerprints
{parent=Methodology}

= Fingerprint
{synonym}

From <The Reuters websites> and others we've found, we can establish see some clear stylistic trends across the websites which would allow us to find other likely candidates upon inspection:
* natural sounding, sometimes long-ish, <domain names> generally with 2 or 3 full words. Most in English language, but a few in Spanish, and very few in other languages like French.
* shallow websites with a few tabs, many external links, sometimes many images, and few internal pages
* common themes include:
  * news
  * hobbies, notably sports, travel and <photography>. Golf seems overrepresented. Must be a thing over there in Langley.
* .com and .net <top-level domains>, plus a few other very rare <non .com .net TLDs>, notably .info and .org
* each one has one "communication mechanism file": <communication mechanisms>
* narrow page width like in the days of old, lots of images
* <split header images>
* some common pattern they follow in their news lists:
  * `ul.rss-items > li.rss-item`, e.g.: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202092126/http://beamingnews.com/
  * links with class `a.newslink` and `a.newslinkalt` e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20110128181622/http://profile-news.com/
The most notable dissonance from the rest of the web is that there are no commercial looking website of companies, presumably because it was felt that it would be possible to verify the existence of such companies.

Most domains are the only domain for its IP, i.e. the websites are mostly private hosted. However we have later found many exceptions to this general indicator, so it should not be used as a strong exclusion rule.

It would be fun to actually reverse search into one of their stock image provider's original images. Ones we've found:
* https://web.archive.org/web/20110207201846/http://totallynewsnow.com/
  * https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/news-gm101581053-7410445
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/media/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/screenshots/starwarsweb.net.jpg
  * https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/photo/little-jedi-royalty-free-image/172984439[]

= Split header images
{parent=Fingerprints}

Many of the website banners are composed of several images cut up.

Often stock images were first assembled into the banner, and then the resulting image was cut.

Possibly this was done to make reverse image search to their stock image provider harder.

But it somewhat backfired and serves as a good marker that confirms authorship.

Maybe it is some kind of outdated web design thing, which they took much further in time than the average website, like the JAR.

Their websites do appear to follow common style guidelines form earlier eras, around the early 2000s notably, some legit sites that look a lot like hits:

An example:
* http://classicalmusicboxonline.com/images/banner_01.jpg
* http://classicalmusicboxonline.com/images/banner_02.jpg
* ...
* http://classicalmusicboxonline.com/images/banner_19.jpg
* http://classicalmusicboxonline.com/images/banner_20.jpg

* https://web.archive.org/web/20031002010827/http://www.ausiranstudy.com/

Looking at the source code of: https://web.archive.org/web/20130828122833/http://euronewsonline.net/euro_bus.php we noticed an interesting comment:
``
<!-- ImageReady Slices (enewsweather.psd) -->
``
which presumably refers to Adobe ImageReady:
> Adobe ImageReady was a bitmap graphics editor that was shipped with Adobe Photoshop for six years. It was available for Windows, Classic Mac OS and Mac OS X from 1998 to 2007. ImageReady was designed for web development and closely interacted with Photoshop
A sample tutorial: https://people.goshen.edu/~paulmr/physix/326/imageready/slicendice.php

Some of the websites use CSS background images to populate the images, e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20110201170354/http://ingenuitytrendz.com/[ingenuitytrendz.com] has HTML:

ingenuitytrendz.com/20110201170354/index.html:                  <li><a id="banner1">&nbsp;</a></li>
ingenuitytrendz.com/20110201170354/index.html:                  <li><a id="banner2">&nbsp;</a></li>
ingenuitytrendz.com/20110201170354/index.html:                  <li><a id="banner3">&nbsp;</a></li>
``
and then the CSS https://web.archive.org/web/20110201170405cs_/http://ingenuitytrendz.com/engineering.css[engineering.css] does:
``
#banner1 { background: url(/web/20110201170405im_/http://ingenuitytrendz.com/images/banner_01.jpg) no-repeat center; }
#banner2 { background: url(/web/20110201170405im_/http://ingenuitytrendz.com/images/banner_02.jpg) no-repeat center; }
#banner3 { background: url(/web/20110201170405im_/http://ingenuitytrendz.com/images/banner_03.jpg) no-repeat center; }

= HTML analysis
{parent=Fingerprints}

The HTML from the index page of Wayback Machine were:
* dumped at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/tree/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/html[]
* downloaded with: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/tree/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/download-html.sh[]. Note that there were many supurious errors notably:
  > OpenSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection to web.archive.org:443
  we just ran it multiple times until all errors were gone.

The best way to analyse the HTML is to grap our dumps from: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cia-2010-websites-dump[].

Some possibly interesting searches include:
* list all HTML comments, maybe something spicy was left over:
  ``
  git grep '<!--'
  ``
* search for weird file extensions:
  ``
  git ls-files | grep -Ev '\.(jpg|gif|html|txt|png|css|php|js|jar|cgi|htm|swf|ico|JPG|class|zip|sf)'
  ``
* have a look at the largest folers:
  ``
  ncdeu
  ``

Some of the HTML files contain <#conditional comments> e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20091023041107/http://aquaswimming.com/ contains:
``
<!--[if IE 6]> <link href="swimstyleie6.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> <![endif]-->
``

Varios of the non-English websites seem to have comments translating the content e.g.:
``
./noticiasmusica.net/20101230165001/index.html:<h2>Alguns dos Melhores Sites Nacionais</h2><!--some of the best national sites (in music)-->
``
This feels like it could be the translation helping the technical webdev team know what is what.

Many of the RSS frame pages use:
``
<base target="_blank" />
``
which is a weird HTML tag that would lead all links to open on new tabs, e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20110202124411/http://thecricketfan.com/home.html[].

Various websites have pages with .php extension. It feels likely that all websites were written in <PHP>.

Some sites use a `feeds.php` for the feeds, e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20101231174008/http://www.absolutebearing.net//absolutebearing_feeds/feeds.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds2.feedburner.com%2FOceanyachtsinfo&desc=1[\http://www.absolutebearing.net//absolutebearing_feeds/feeds.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds2.feedburner.com%2FOceanyachtsinfo&desc=1]

Some URLs existed both in HTML and .php extension, or were converted at some point:
``
allworldstatistics.com/20110207151941/comprehensivesources.html
allworldstatistics.com/20130818155225/comprehensivesources.php
``

A few of the PHP urls have weird IDs in them like `omktf`, `juqwt` and `qlaqft`:
``
./middle-east-newstoday.com/20100829004127/omktf/uirl.php?ok=461128
./newsandsportscentral.com/20100327130237/juqwt/eubcek.php?pe=747155
./pondernews.net/20100826031745/lldwg/qlaqft.php?fc=281298
``
we wonder what they mean.

= Binary files
{parent=HTML analysis}

As per:
``
grep . */index.html | grep 'binary file matches'
``
a few of the HTMLs are interpreted by grep as being binary:
``
grep: china-destinations.org/index.html: binary file matches
grep: classicalmusicboxonline.com/index.html: binary file matches
grep: driversinternationalgolf.com/index.html: binary file matches

= HTML title element
{parent=HTML analysis}

The discoverty of a <possible HTML information leaks> on HTML `<title>` of https://web.archive.org/web/20110207150839/http://webofcheer.com/[webofcheer.com] which is cryptically set as:
``
pg1c
``
motivated us to download all HTML and have a grep.

We started grepping with:
``
grep -ai '<title>' */index.html
``
and to just get the titles alone for visual inspection:
``
grep -ahi '<title>' */index.html | sed -r 's/^\s*<title>//;s/<\/title>.*//'
``

Some mildly interesting facts include:
* opensourcenewstoday.com is titled just as "Title"
  ``
  opensourcenewstoday.com/index.html:<title>Title</title>
  ``
* a few sites are titled "Untitled Document" e.g.:
  ``
  media-coverage-now.com/index.html:<title>Untitled Document</title>
  newsandsportscentral.com/index.html:  <title>Untitled Document</title>
  newsincirculation.com/index.html:<title>Untitled Document</title>

  primetimemovies.net/index.html:<title>Untitled Document</title>
  unganadormundial.com/index.html:<title>Untitled Document</title>

It is impossible to tell if these were oversights, or intentional to simulate common web development quircks. But they are cute in any case.

= IP range search
{parent=Methodology}

One promising way to find more of those would be with <IP> searches, since it was stated in the <Reuters article> that the <CIA> made the terrible mistake of using several contiguous IP blocks for those website. What a phenomenal <OPSEC> failure!!!

The easiest way would be if <Wayback Machine> itself had an IP search function, but we couldn't find one: <Search Wayback Machine by IP>.

https://viewdns.info was the first easily accessible website that <Ciro Santilli> could find that contained such information.

Our current results indicate that the typical IP range is about 30 IPs wide.

E.g. searching: https://viewdns.info/iphistory[] and considering only hits from 2011 or earlier we obtain:
* capture-nature.com
  * 65.61.127.163 - Greenacres - United States - TierPoint - 2013-10-19
* activegaminginfo.com
  * 66.175.106.148 - United States - Verizon Business - 2012-03-03
* iraniangoals.com
  * 68.178.232.100 - United States - GoDaddy.com - 2011-11-13
  * 69.65.33.21 - Flushing - United States - GigeNET - 2011-09-08
* rastadirect.net
  * 68.178.232.100 - United States - GoDaddy.com - 2011-05-02
* iraniangoalkicks.com
  * 68.178.232.100 - United States - GoDaddy.com - 2011-04-04
* headlines2day.com
  * 118.139.174.1 - Singapore - Web Hosting Service - 2013-06-30. Source: viewdns.info
  * 184.168.221.91 2013-08-12T06:17:39. Source: <2013 DNS Census> grep
* fightwithoutrules.com
  * 204.11.56.25 - British Virgin Islands - Confluence Networks Inc - 2013-09-26
  * 208.91.197.19 - British Virgin Islands - Confluence Networks Inc - 2013-05-20
  * 212.4.17.38 - Milan - Italy - MCI Worldcom Italy Spa - 2012-03-03
* fitness-dawg.com
  * 219.90.62.243 - Taiwan - Verizon Taiwan Co. Limited - 2012-01-11

Neither of these seem to be in the same ranges, the only common nearby hit amongst these ranges is the exact `68.178.232.100`, and doing reverse IP search at https://viewdns.info/reverseip/?host=68.178.232.100&t=1 states that it has 2.5 million hostnames associated to it, so it must be some kind of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service[Shared web hosting service], see also: https://superuser.com/questions/577070/is-it-possible-for-many-domain-names-to-share-one-ip-address[], which makes search hard.

Ciro then tried some of the other IPs, and soon hit gold.

Initially, Ciro started by doing manual queries to viewdns.info/reversip until his IP was blocked. Then he created an account and used his 250 free queries with the following helper script: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh]. The output of that script can be seen at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh[].

Ciro then found <2013 DNS Census> which contained data highly disjoint form the viewdns-info one!

Summaries of the IP range exploration done so far follows, combined data from all databases above.

= Hits without nearby IP hits
{parent=IP range search}
{tag=TODO}

Here we list of suspected domains for which the correct IP was apparently not found since there are no neighbouring hits.

These are suspicious, and suggest either that we didn't obtain the correct reverse IP, or a change in CIA methodology from an older time at which they were not yet using the obscene IP ranges.

For example, in the case of inews-today.com, <2013 DNS Census> gave one IP 193.203.49.212, but then <viewdns.info> gave another one 66.175.106.146 which fit into an existing IP range, and which assumed to be the correct IP of interest.

A similar case happened when we found IP 212.209.74.126 for headlines2day.com with <dnshistory.org>: https://dnshistory.org/historical-dns-records/a/headlines2day.com.

It is also possible that some of them are simply false positives so they should be taken with a grain of salt. Further reverse engineering e.g. of <comms> or <HTML analysis> might be able to exclude some of them.

It is interesting to note that Reuters seems to have featured disproportionately many hits from that range, one wonders why that happened. It is possible that they chose these because they actually didn't have any nearby hits to give away less obvious information, though they did pick some from the ranges as wel.

In what follows we list the domains with possible reverse IPs and what was explored so far for each. We consider IPs not in a range to be uncertain, and that instead their domains might have been previously in a range which we

= Possible hits

= Possible hits that are too broken to be sure
{synonym}

Likely hits possible but whose archives is too broken to be easily certain. If:
* <Hits without nearby IP hits>[nearby IP hits]
* proper reverse engineering of their comms if any, or any other page fingerprints
were to ever be found, these would be considered hits.

* 216.97.231.56 nouvelles-d-aujourdhuis.com. https://web.archive.org/web/20110128173431/http://nouvelles-d-aujourdhuis.com/[2011]. Stylistically perfect, but no nearby IP hits. <domainsbyproxy.com>. Maybe looking into HTML would help confirm:
  * `rss-items`
  But wrong IP? likely <CGI comms variant> under the signup page: https://web.archive.org/web/20090405045548/http://nouvelles-d-aujourdhuis.com/members.html[].

  Tested <viewdns.info> range: 216.97.231.46 - 216.97.231.66. Not a single reverse IP hit in there.

  <viewdns.info> also assigns it 50.63.202.46, GoDaddy.com, LLC, 2013-11-08 in addition to 216.97.231.56, Canada, IPXO LLC, 2013-09-06. This is very near other iranfootballsource.com flukes, so likely useless.

  <securitytrails.com> also gives it one earlier IP 209.200.240.250 last seen 2008-09-20: https://securitytrails.com/domain/nouvelles-d-aujourdhuis.com/history/a Hydra Communications Ltd before 216.97.231.56 "ASU doctor" first seen 2008-09-20 (15 years)> Tested viewdns.info range: 209.200.240.240 - 209.200.240.260 empty at the time of interest.

{parent=Methodology}

= Find missing hits in IP ranges
{parent=TODO}

All IP ranges have some holes in them for which we don't have a domain name.

It is because there was nothing there, or just because we don't have a good enough reverse IP database?

It is possible that <DomainTools> could help with a more complete database, but its access is <DomainTools pricing>[extremely expensive and out of reach at the moment].

<Censys> is another option that would be good to try.

Putting 140 USD into <WhoisXMLAPI> to get all whois histories of interest for possible reverse searches would also be of interest.

= How did Alexa find the domains?
{parent=TODO}

It can't be <HTML> crawl because presumably there wouldn't have been links to those websites? Presumably this is why <Common Crawl> doesn't seem to have any hits.

So they must have had some kind of DNS A record database?

Or would IPv4 sweep have worked, without the `Host` header with the CIA's setup?

The same question also applies to the <2013 DNS Census>. It has less hits, but still has many.

Whatever they did, we are so so glad that they did!

= Non .com .net TLDs
{parent=TODO}

.com and .net are very dominant. Here we list other choices made:
* `.info`: has a few hits:
  * archived <comms>:
    * beyondthefringe.info
  * unarchived <comms>:
    * crickettoday.info
  * unarchived:
    * talkingpointnews.info
    * theventurenews.info
    * worldconcerns.info
  Did a full <Wayback Machine CDX scanning> on .info after:
  ``
  grep -e news -e noticias -e nouvelles -e world -e global
  ``
  That makes about 10k domains, so it's about the right size.
* `.org`: has a least one hit, see: <Are there .org hits?>
* `.biz`:
  * unarchived <comms>:
    * atthemovies.biz

= Are there .org hits?
{parent=Non .com .net TLDs}

= .org hit
{synonym}

Previously it was unclear if there were any .org hits, until we found the first one with clear <comms>: https://web.archive.org/web/20110624203548/http://awfaoi.org/hand.jar

Later on, two more clear ones were found with <expired domain trackers>:
* azerinews.org
* autism-news.org
further settling their existence. Later on newimages.org also came to light.

Others that had been previously found in IP ranges but without clear comms:
* 65.61.127.177: material-science.org
* 212.4.17.61: tech-stop.org
* 74.116.72.244 arborstribune.org

.org is very rare, and has been excluded from some of our search heuristics. That was a shame, but likely not much was missed.

= Data sources
{parent=Methodology}

This is a dark art, and many of the sources are shady as fuck! We often have no idea of their methodology. Also no source is fully complete. We just piece up as best we can.

In order to explore IPs in known IP ranges, what we need are good <DNS databases>.

* https://www.zone-h.org/archive/ip=208.76.80.93/page=11?hz=1 mentions `newsupdatesite.com` and mentions "defacement", the <Mass Deface III pastebin> comes to mind. No other nearby hits on quick inspection.

= Reuters article
{parent=Data sources}
{title2=2022-09-29}

https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran

This is our primary data source, the first article that pointed out <The Reuters websites>[a few specific CIA websites] which then served as the basis for all of our research.

We take the truth of this article as an <axiom>. And then all we claim is that all other websites found were made by the same people due to strong <Fingerprints>[shared design principles] of the such websites.

= Wayback Machine
{parent=Data sources}
{tag=/Wayback Machine}

D'oh.

But to be serious. The </Wayback Machine> contains a very large proportion of all sites. It does happen sometime that a Wayback Machine archive is missing or broken and <cqcounter> has the screenshot. But the Wayback Machine is still the most complete database we have found so far. Some archives are very broken. But those are rare.

The only problem with the </Wayback Machine> is that there is no known efficient way to query its archives across domains. You have to have a domain in hand for CDX queries: <Wayback Machine CDX scanning>.

The <Common Crawl> project attempts in part to address this lack of querriability, but we haven't managed to extract any hits from it.

CDX + <2013 DNS Census> + heuristics however has been fruitful however.

We have dumped all Wayback Machine archives of known websites to: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cia-2010-websites-dump using \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/download-websites.sh]. This allows for better grepping and serves as a backup in case they ever go down.

= Wayback Machine CDX scanning
{parent=Wayback Machine}

The Wayback Machine has an endpoint to query cralwed pages called the CDX server. It is documented at: https://github.com/internetarchive/wayback/blob/master/wayback-cdx-server/README.md[].

This allows to filter down 10 thousands of possible domains in a few hours. But 100s of thousands would be too much. This is because you have to query exactly one URL at a time, and they possibly rate limit IPs. But no IP blacklisting so far after several hours, so it's not that bad.

Once you have a heuristic to narrow down some domains, you can use this helper: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/cdx.sh] to drill them down from 10s of thousands down to hundreds or thousands.

We then post process the results of cdx.sh with \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/cdx-post.sh] to drill them down from from thousands to dozens, and manually inspect everything.

From then on, you can just manually inspect for hist on your browser.

= Wayback Machine CDX scanning with Tor parallelization
{parent=Wayback Machine CDX scanning}

Dire times require dire methods: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/cdx-tor.sh].

First we must start the tor servers with the `tor-army` command from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14321214/how-to-run-multiple-tor-processes-at-once-with-different-exit-ips/76749983#76749983
``
tor-army 100
``
and then use it on a newline separated domain name list to check;
``
./cdx-tor.sh infile.txt
``
This creates a directory `infile.txt.cdx/` containing:
* `infile.txt.cdx/out00`, `out01`, etc.: the suspected CDX lines from domains from each tor instance based on the simple criteria that the CDX can handle directly. We split the input domains into 100 piles, and give one selected pile per tor instance.
* `infile.txt.cdx/out`: the final combined CDX output of `out00`, `out01`, ...
* `infile.txt.cdx/out.post`: the final output containing only domain names that match further CLI criteria that cannot be easily encoded on the CDX query. This is the cleanest domain name list you should look into at the end basically.

Since archive is so abysmal in its data access, e.g. a <Google BigQuery> would solve our issues in seconds, we have to come up with creative ways of getting around their IP throttling.

The <CIA> doesn't play fair. They're actually the exact opposite of fair. So neither shall we.

Distilled into an answer at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14321214/how-to-run-multiple-tor-processes-at-once-with-different-exit-ips/76749983#76749983

This should allow a full sweep of the 4.5M records in <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup> in a reasonable amount of time. After JAR/SWF/CGI filtering we obtained 5.8k domains, so a reduction factor of about 1 million with likely very few losses. Not bad.

5.8k is still a bit annoying to fully go over however, so we can also try to count CDX hits to the domains and remove anything with too many hits, since the CIA websites basically have very few archives:
``
cd 2013-dns-census-a-novirt-domains.txt.cdx
./cdx-tor.sh -d out.post domain-list.txt
cd out.post.cdx
cut -d' ' -f1 out | uniq -c | sort -k1 -n | awk 'match($2, /([^,]+),([^)]+)/, a) {printf("%s.%s %d\n", a[2], a[1], $1)}' > out.count
``
This gives us something like:
``
12654montana.com 1
aeronet-news.com 1
atohms.com 1
av3net.com 1
beechstreetas400.com 1
``
sorted by increasing hit counts, so we can go down as far as patience allows for!

New results from a full CDX scan of 2013-dns-census-a-novirt.csv:
* 219.90.61.123 journeystravelled.com

= JS CDX scanning
{parent=Wayback Machine CDX scanning}

JAR, SWF and CGI-bin scanning by path only is fine, since there are relatively few of those. But .js scanning by path only is too broad.

One option would be to filter out by size, an information that is contained on the CDX. Let's check typical ones:
``
grep -f <(jq -r '.[]|select(select(.comms)|.comms|test("\\.js"))|.host' ../media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.json) out | out.jshits.cdx
sort -n -k7 out.jshits.cdx
``
Ignoring some obvious unrelated non-comms files visually we get a range of about 2732 to 3632:
``
net,hollywoodscreen)/current.js 20110106082232 http://hollywoodscreen.net/current.js text/javascript 200 XY5NHVW7UMFS3WSKPXLOQ5DJA34POXMV 2732
com,amishkanews)/amishkanewss.js 20110208032713 http://amishkanews.com/amishkanewss.js text/javascript 200 S5ZWJ53JFSLUSJVXBBA3NBJXNYLNCI4E 3632
``
This ignores the obviously atypical <JavaScript with SHAs> from iranfootballsource, and the particularly small old menu.js from cutabovenews.com, which we embed into \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/cdx-post-js.sh].

The size helps a bit, but it's not insanely good unfortunately, only about 3x, these are some common JS sizes right there!

= Wayback Machine crawl date search
{parent=Wayback Machine}

Many hits appear to happen on the same days, and per-day data does exist: https://archive.org/details/widecrawl but apparently cannot be publicly downloaded unfortunately. But maybe there's another way? TODO select candidates.

= viewdns.info
{parent=Data sources}
{tag=Data as a service}
{title2=2010-}

Accounts used so far: 6 (1500 reverse IP checks).

Their historic DNS and reverse DNS info was very valuable, and served as Ciro's the initial entry point to finding hits in the IP ranges given by Reuters.

Generic information about the website not specific on this project will be stored at: </viewdns.info>{full}.

Since this source is so scarce and valuable, we have been quite careful to note down all the domain and IP ranges that have been explored.

At https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38496244[], the creator of the viewdns.info, "Hughesey", also stated that he'd able to give some free credits for public research projects such as this one. This would have saved up going to quite a few Cafes to get those sweet extra IPs! But it was more fun in hardmode, no doubt.

We do API access to IP ranges with this simple helper: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh], usage:
``
./viewdns-info.sh <apikey> <start-ipv-address> <end-ipv-address>
``
e.g.:
``
./viewdns-info.sh 8b890b00b17ed2d66bbed878d51200b58d43d014 66.45.179.187 66.45.179.210
``

For domain to IP queries from the API you should use "iphistory" https://viewdns.info/api/docs/ip-history.php[]:
``
curl 'https://api.viewdns.info/iphistory/?domain=todaysengineering.com&apikey=$APIKEY&output=json'
``

Just beware of the <viewdns.info reverse IP bug>, that really sucks and led to us missing a ton of domains.

= DNS Census 2013
{parent=Data sources}

= 2013 DNS Census
{synonym}

Main article: </DNS Census 2013>.

This data source was very valuable, and led to many hits, and to finding the first non Reuters ranges with <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census>{full}.

Hit overlap:
``
jq -r '.[].host' ../media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.json ) | xargs -I{} sqlite3 aiddcu.sqlite "select * from t where d = '{}'"
``
Domain hit count when we were at 279 hits: 142 hits, so about half of the hits were present.

The timing of the database is perfect for this project, it is as if the CIA had planted it themselves!

= 2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup
{parent=DNS Census 2013}

We've noticed that often when there is a hit range:
* there is only one IP for each domain
* there is a range of about 20-30 of those
and that this does not seem to be that common. Let's see if that is a reasonable fingerprint or not.

Note that although this is the most common case, we have found multiple hits that <viewdns.info> maps to the same IP.

First we create a table `u` (`unique`) that only have domains which are the only domain for an IP, let's see by how much that lowers the 191 M total unique domains:
``
time sqlite3 u.sqlite 'create table t (d text, i text)'
time sqlite3 av.sqlite -cmd "attach 'u.sqlite' as u" "insert into u.t select min(d) as d, min(i) as i from t where d not like '%.%.%' group by i having count(distinct d) = 1"
``
The `not like '%.%.%'` removes subdomains from the counts so that <CGI comms> are still included, and `distinct` in `count(distinct` is because we have multiple entries at different timestamps for some of the hits.

Let's start with the 208 subset to see how it goes:
``
time sqlite3 av.sqlite -cmd "attach 'u.sqlite' as u" "insert into u.t select min(d) as d, min(i) as i from t where i glob '208.*' and d not like '%.%.%' and (d like '%.com' or d like '%.net') group by i having count(distinct d) = 1"
``
OK, after we fixed bugs with the above we are down to 4 million lines with unique domain/IP pairs and which contains all of the original hits! Almost certainly more are to be found!

This data is so valuable that we've decided to upload it to: https://archive.org/details/2013-dns-census-a-novirt.csv Format:
``
8,chrisjmcgregor.com
11,80end.com
28,fine5.net
38,bestarabictv.com
49,xy005.com
50,cmsasoccer.com
80,museemontpellier.net
100,newtiger.com
108,lps-promptservice.com
111,bridesmaiddressesshow.com
``
The numbers of the first column are the IPs as a 32-bit integer representation, which is more useful to search for ranges in.

To make a <histogram> with the distribution of the single hostname IPs:
``
#!/usr/bin/env bash
bin=$((2**24))
sqlite3 2013-dns-census-a-novirt.sqlite -cmd '.mode csv' >2013-dns-census-a-novirt-hist.csv <<EOF
select i, sum(cnt) from (
  select floor(i/${bin}) as i,
         count(*) as cnt
    from t
    group by 1
  union
  select *, 0 as cnt from generate_series(0, 255)
)
group by i
EOF
gnuplot \
  -e 'set terminal svg size 1200, 800' \
  -e 'set output "2013-dns-census-a-novirt-hist.svg"' \
  -e 'set datafile separator ","' \

  -e 'set ylabel "count"' \
  -e 'plot "2013-dns-census-a-novirt-hist.csv" using 1:2:1 with labels' \
;
``
Which gives the following useless noise, there is basically no pattern:

There are two keywords that are killers: "news" and "world" and their translations or closely related words. Everything else is hard. So a good start is:

``

``

iran + football:

3 easy hits with "noticias" (news in Portuguese or Spanish"), uncovering two brand new ip ranges:

* 66.237.236.247 comunidaddenoticias.com

= 2013 DNS census MX records
{parent=DNS Census 2013}

Let' see if there's anything in records/mx.xz.

mx.csv is 21GB.

They do have `"` in the files to escape commas so:

mx.py
``
import csv
import sys
writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
with open('mx.csv', 'r') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        writer.writerow([row[0], row[3]])
``
Would have been better with csvkit: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36287982/bash-parse-csv-with-quotes-commas-and-newlines

then:

``
# uniq not amazing as there are often two or three slightly different records repeated on multiple timestamps, but down to 11 GB
python3 mx.py | uniq > mx-uniq.csv
sqlite3 mx.sqlite 'create table t(d text, m text)'
# 13 GB
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite ".import --csv --skip 1 'mx-uniq.csv' t"

# 41 GB
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite 'create index td on t(d)'
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite 'create index tm on t(m)'
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite 'create index tdm on t(d, m)'

# Remove dupes.
# Rows: 150m

delete from t
where rowid not in (
  select min(rowid)
  from t
  group by d, m
)
EOF

# 15 GB
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite vacuum
``

Let's see what the hits use:
``
awk -F, 'NR>1{ print $2 }' ../media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.csv | xargs -I{} sqlite3 mx.sqlite "select distinct * from t where d = '{}'"
``

At around 267 total hits, only 84 have MX records, and from those that do, almost all of them have exactly:
``
smtp.secureserver.net
mailstore1.secureserver.net
``
with only three exceptions:
``
dailynewsandsports.com|dailynewsandsports.com
inews-today.com|mail.inews-today.com
just-kidding-news.com|just-kidding-news.com
``
We need to count out of the totals!
``
sqlite3 mx.sqlite "select count(*) from t where m = 'mailstore1.secureserver.net'"
``
which gives, ~18M, so nope, it is too much by itself...

Let's try to use that to reduce `av.sqlite` from <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup> a bit further:
``
time sqlite3 mx.sqlite '.mode csv' "attach 'aiddcu.sqlite' as 'av'" '.load ./ip' "select ipi2s(av.t.i), av.t.d from av.t inner join t as mx on av.t.d = mx.d and mx.m = 'mailstore1.secureserver.net' order by av.t.i asc" > avm.csv
``
where `avm` stands for `av` with `mx` pruning. This leaves us with only ~500k entries left. With one more figerprint we could do a <Wayback Machine CDX scanning> scan.

Let's check that we still have most our hits in there:
``
grep -f <(awk -F, 'NR>1{print $2}' /home/ciro/bak/git/media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.csv) avm.csv
``
At 267 hits we got 81, so all are still present.

We intersect <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup> with <2013 DNS census MX records> and that leaves 460k hits. We did lose a third on the the MX records as of 260 hits since secureserver.net is only used in 1/3 of sites, but we also concentrate 9x, so it may be worth it.

= 2013 DNS census NS records
{parent=DNS Census 2013}

ns.csv is 57 GB. This file is too massive, working with it is a pain.

We can also cut down the data a lot with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1915636/is-there-a-way-to-uniq-by-column/76605540#76605540[] and <Non .com .net TLDs>[tld filtering]:

``
This brings us down to a much more manageable 3.0 GB, 83 M rows.

Let's just scan it once real quick to start with, since likely nothing will come of this venue:
``

Doubt anything will come out of this.

Let's do a bit of counting out of the total:
``
grep domaincontrol.com ns.csv | awk -F, '{print $1}' | uniq | wc
``
gives ~20M domain using `domaincontrol`. Let's see how many domains are in the first place:
``
awk -F, '{print $1}' ns.csv | uniq | wc
``
so it accounts for 1/4 of the total.

= 2013 DNS census SOA records
{parent=DNS Census 2013}

Same as <2013 DNS census NS records> basically, nothing came out.

= dnshistory.org
{parent=Data sources}

dnshistory.org contains historical domain -> mappings.

We have not managed to extract much from this source, they don't have as much data on the range of interest.

But they do have some unique data at least, perhaps we should try them a bit more often, e.g. they were the only source we've seen so far that made the association: headlines2day.com -> 212.209.74.126 which places it in the more plausible globalbaseballnews.com IP range.

TODO can it do IP to domain? Or just domain to IP? Asked on their Discord: https://discord.com/channels/698151879166918727/968586102493552731/1124254204257632377[]. Their banner suggests that yes:
> With our new look website you can now find other domains hosted on the same IP address, your website neighbours and more even quicker than before.

Owner replied, you can't:
> At the moment you can only do this for current not historical records

This is a shame, reverse IP here could be quite valuable.

In principle, we could obtain this data from search engines, but Google doesn't track that entire website well, e.g. no hits for `site:dnshistory.org "62.22.60.48"` presumably due to heavy IP throttling.

Homepage https://dnshistory.org/ gives date starting in 2009:
> Here at DNS History we have been crawling DNS records since 2009, our database currently contains over 1 billion domains and over 12 billion DNS records.
and it is true that they do have some hits from that useful era.

Any data that we have the patience of extracting from this we will dump under https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.json[].

= securitytrails.com
{parent=Data sources}

They appear to piece together data from various sources. This is the most complete historical domain -> IP database we have so far. They don't have hugely more data than <viewdns.info>, but many times do offer something new. It feels like the key difference is that their data goes further back in the critical time period a bit.

TODO do they have historical reverse IP? The fact that they don't seem to have it suggests that they are just making historical reverse IP requests to a third party via some API?

E.g. searching `thefilmcentre.com` under historical data at https://securitytrails.com/domain/thefilmcentre.com/history/al gives the correct IP 62.22.60.55.

But searching the IP 62.22.60.55 is empty and there's no historical data option?

Account creation blacklists common email providers such as gmail to force users to use a "corporate" email address. But using random domains like `ciro@cirosantilli.com` works fine.

Their data seems to date back to 2008 for our searches.

= Common Crawl
{parent=Data sources}

So far, no new domains have been found with <Common Crawl>, nor have any existing known domains been found to be present in Common Crawl. Our working theory is that Common Crawl never reached the domains <How did Alexa find the domains?>

Let's try and do something with <Common Crawl>.

Unfortunately there's no <IP> data apparently: https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-index-table/issues/30[], so let's focus on the URLs.

Using their <Common Crawl Athena> method: https://commoncrawl.org/2018/03/index-to-warc-files-and-urls-in-columnar-format/

So `url_host_3rd_last_part` might be a winner for <CGI comms> fingerprinting!

Naive one for one index:

Let's see if they have any of the domain hits. Let's also restrict by date to try and reduce the data scanned:
``

   'topbillingsite.com',
   'worldwildlifeadventure.com'

``
Humm, data scanned: 60.59 GB and no hits... weird.

Sanity check:
``
select * from "ccindex"."ccindex" WHERE
  crawl = 'CC-MAIN-2013-20' AND
  subset = 'warc' AND
  url_host_registered_domain IN (
   'google.com',
   'amazon.com'
 )
``
has a bunch of hits of course. Data scanned: 212.88 MB, `WHERE` `crawl` and `subset` are a must! Should have read the article first.

Let's widen a bit more:
``
select * from "ccindex"."ccindex" WHERE
  crawl IN (
    'CC-MAIN-2013-20',
    'CC-MAIN-2013-48',

Does not appear to have any reverse IP hits unfortunately: https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/1951/dataset-of-domain-names/21077#21077[]. Likely only has domains that were explicitly advertised.

We could not find anything useful in it so far, but there is great potential to use this tool to find new IP ranges based on properties of existing IP ranges. Part of the problem is that the dataset is huge, and is split by top 256 bytes. But it would be reasonable to at least explore ranges with pre-existing known hits...

We have started looking for patterns on `66.*` and `208.*`, both selected as two relatively far away ranges that have a number of pre-existing hits. 208 should likely have been 212 considering later finds that put several ranges in 212.

Suggests exactly 223 - 192 + 1 = 31 IPs.

Let's have a look at the file `68`: outcome: no clear hits like on 208. One wonders why.

It does appears that long sequences of ranges are a sort of fingerprint. The question is how unique it would be.

First:
``
n=208
time awk '$3=="up"{ print $1 }' $n | uniq -c | sed -r 's/^ +//;s/ /,/' | tee $n-up-uniq
t=$n-up-uniq.sqlite
rm -f $t
time sqlite3 $t 'create table tmp(cnt text, i text)'
time sqlite3 $t ".import --csv $n-up-uniq tmp"
time sqlite3 $t 'create table t (i integer)'
time sqlite3 $t '.load ./ip' 'insert into t select str2ipv4(i) from tmp'
time sqlite3 $t 'drop table tmp'
time sqlite3 $t 'create index ti on t(i)'
``
This reduces us to 2 million IP rows from the total possible 16 million IPs.

OK now just counting hits on fixed windows has way too many results:
``
sqlite3 208-up-uniq.sqlite "\
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT min(i), COUNT(*) OVER (
    ORDER BY i RANGE BETWEEN 15 PRECEDING AND 15 FOLLOWING
  ) as c FROM t
) WHERE c > 20 and c < 30
"
``

Let's try instead consecutive ranges of length exactly 31 instead then:
``
sqlite3 208-up-uniq.sqlite <<EOF
SELECT f, t - f as c FROM (
  SELECT min(i) as f, max(i) as t
  FROM (SELECT i, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY i) - i as grp FROM t)
  GROUP BY grp
  ORDER BY i
) where c = 31
EOF
``
271. Hmm. A bit more than we'd like...

Another route is to also count the ups:
``
n=208
time awk '$3=="up"{ print $1 }' $n | uniq -c | sed -r 's/^ +//;s/ /,/' | tee $n-up-uniq-cnt
t=$n-up-uniq-cnt.sqlite
rm -f $t
time sqlite3 $t 'create table tmp(cnt text, i text)'
time sqlite3 $t ".import --csv $n-up-uniq-cnt tmp"
time sqlite3 $t 'create table t (cnt integer, i integer)'
time sqlite3 $t '.load ./ip' 'insert into t select cnt as integer, str2ipv4(i) from tmp'
time sqlite3 $t 'drop table tmp'
time sqlite3 $t 'create index ti on t(i)'
``

Let's see how many consecutives with counts:
``
sqlite3 208-up-uniq-cnt.sqlite <<EOF
SELECT f, t - f as c FROM (
  SELECT min(i) as f, max(i) as t
  FROM (SELECT i, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY i) - i as grp FROM t WHERE cnt >= 3)
  GROUP BY grp
  ORDER BY i
) where c > 28 and c < 32
EOF
``

Let's check on 66:
``

``

OK down to 45 MB, now we can work.

= tb0hdan/domains
{parent=Data sources}

Domain list only, no IPs and no dates. We haven't been able to extract anything of interest from this source so far.

Domain hit count when we were at 69 hits: only 9, some of which had been since reused. Likely their data collection did not cover the dates of interest.

= Expired domain trackers
{parent=Data sources}
{tag=/Expired domain tracker}

When you <Google> most of the hit domains, many of them show up on "expired domain trackers", and above all Chinese expired domain trackers for some reason, notably e.g.:
* https://hupo.com[]: e.g. http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2012-03-06（国际域名）.txt[]. Heavily IP throttled. Tor hindered more than helped.

  First known working day: `2011-07-29`.

  Scraping script: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hupo.sh]. Scraping does about 1 day every 5 minutes relatively reliably, so about 36 hours / year. Not bad.

  Results are stored under `tmp/humo/<day>`.

  Check for hit overlap:
  ``
  grep -Fx -f <( jq -r '.[].host' ../media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.json ) cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/tmp/hupo/*
  ``
  The hits are very well distributed amongst days and months, at least they did a good job hiding these potential timing fingerprints. This feels very deliberately designed.

  There are lots of hits. The data set is very inclusive. Also we understand that it must have been obtains through means other than <Web crawling>, since it contains so many of the hits.

  Nice output format for scraping as the HTML is very minimal

  They randomly changed their URL format to remove the space before the .com after 2012-02-03:
  * http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2012-01-01（国际域名）%20.txt
  * http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2013-01-01（国际域名）.txt

  Some of their files are simply missing however unfortunately, e.g. neither of the following exist:
  * http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2012-07-01（国际域名）%20.txt
  * http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2012-07-01（国际域名）.txt
  webmasterhome.cn did contain that one however: http://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2012-07-01.asp[]. Hmm. we might have better luck over there then?

  2018-11-19 is corrupt in a new and wonderful way, with a bunch of trailing zeros:
  ``
  wget -O hupo-2018-11-19 'http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2018-11-19%EF%BC%88%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85%E5%9F%9F%E5%90%8D%EF%BC%89.txt
  hd hupo-2018-11-19

  ends in:
  ``

  ``

  More generally, several files contain invalid domain names with non-ASCII characters, e.g. 2013-01-02 contains `365<D3>л<FA><C2><CC>.com`. Domain names can only contain ASCII charters: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1133424/what-are-the-valid-characters-that-can-show-up-in-a-url-host Maybe we should get rid of any such lines as noise.

  Some files around 2011-09-06 start with an empty line. 2014-01-15 starts with about twenty empty lines. Oh and that last one also has some trash bytes the end  `<B7><B5><BB><D8>`. Beauty.
* https://webmasterhome.cn[]: e.g. http://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2012-03-06.asp[]. Appears to contain the exact same data as "static.hupo.com"

  First known working day: `2011-08-18`.

  Also heavily IP throttled, and a bit more than hupo apparently.

  Scraper \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/webmastercn.sh].

  Also has some randomly missing dates like hupo.com, though different missing ones from hupo, so they complement each other nicely.

  Some of the URLs are broken and don't inform that with HTTP status code, they just replace the results with some Chinese text 无法找到该页 (The requested page could not be found):
  * https://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2012-02-06.asp
  * https://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2012-02-14.asp
  * https://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2013-04-30.asp

  Several URLs just return length 0 content, e.g.:
  ``
  curl -vvv http://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2015-10-31.asp
  *   Trying 125.90.93.11:80...
  * Connected to domain.webmasterhome.cn (125.90.93.11) port 80 (#0)

  ``
  It is not fully clear if this is a throttling mechanism, or if the data is just missing entirely.

  Starting around 2018, the IP limiting became very intense, 30 mins / 1 hour per URL, so we just gave up. Therefore, data from 2018 onwards does not contain webmasterhome.cn data.

  Starting from `2013-05-10` the format changes randomly. This also shows us that they just have all the HTML pages as static files on their server. E.g. with:
  ``
  grep -a '<pre' * | s
  ``
  we see:
  ``
  2013-05-09:<pre style='font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; '><strong>2013<C4><EA>05<D4><C2>09<C8>յ<BD><C6>ڹ<FA><BC><CA><D3><F2><C3><FB></strong><br>0-3y.com
  2013-05-10:<pre><strong>2013<C4><EA>05<D4><C2>10<C8>յ<BD><C6>ڹ<FA><BC><CA><D3><F2><C3><FB></strong>
  ``
* <justdropped.com>: e.g. https://www.justdropped.com/drops/010112com.html[]. First known working day: `2006-01-01`. Unthrottled.
* http://yoid.com[]: e.g.: http://yoid.com/bydate.php?d=2016-06-03&a=a[]. First known workding day: `2016-06-01`.
This suggests that scraping these lists might be a good starting point to obtaining "all expired domains ever".

Data comparison:
* 2012-01-01
  * http://static.hupo.com/expdomain_myadmin/2012-01-01%EF%BC%88%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85%E5%9F%9F%E5%90%8D%EF%BC%89%20.txt
  * http://domain.webmasterhome.cn/com/2012-01-01.asp
  * https://www.justdropped.com/drops/010112com.html
  Looking only at the `.com`:
  * webmastercn has just about ten extra ones than justdropped, the rest is exactly the same
  * justdropped has some extra and some missing from hupo
  The lists are quite similar however.

  Considering toplevels:
  * hupo has several toplevels that webmastercn does not have, e.g. .org and many others
  * justdropped only covers exactly 6 tlds: `.us`, `.org`, `.net`, `.info`, `.com` and `.biz`. The `.com` lists are very similar to hupo + webmastercn. But it has a lot more non-`.com` domains apparently.

We've made the following pipelines for hupo.com + webmasterhome.cn merging:
``
./hupo.sh &
./webmastercn.sh &
./justdropped.sh &
wait
./justdropped-post.sh
./hupo-merge.sh
# Export as small Google indexable files in a Git repository.
./hupo-repo.sh
# Export as per year zips for Internet Archive.

# Obtain count statistics:

Next, we can start searching by keyword with <Wayback Machine CDX scanning with Tor parallelization> with out helper \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hupo-cdx-tor.sh], e.g. to check domains that contain the term "news":
``
./hupo-cdx-tor.sh mydir 'news|global' 2011 2019
``
produces per-year results for the regex term `news|global` between the years under:
``

tmp/hupo-cdx-tor/mydir/2012
``
OK lets:
``
./hupo-cdx-tor.sh out 'news|headline|internationali|mondo|mundo|mondi|iran|today'
``

Other searches that are not dense enough for our patience:
``

TODO what does this Chinese forum track? New registrations? Their focus seems to be <domain name speculation>

Some of the threads contain domain dumps. We haven't yet seen a scrapable URL pattern, but their data goes way back and did have various hits. The forum seems to have started in 2006: https://club.domain.cn/forum.php?mod=forumdisplay&fid=41&page=10127

https://club.domain.cn/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=241704 "【国际域名拟删除列表】2007年06月16日" is the earliest list we could find. It is an expired domain list.

Some hits:
* https://club.domain.cn/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=709388 contains `alljohnny.com` The thread title is "2009.5.04". The post date 2009-04-30

= "Mass Deface III" pastebin
{parent=Data sources}
{title2=2012}

https://pastebin.com/CTXnhjeS dated mega early on Sep 30th, 2012 by CYBERTAZIEX.

This source was <found by Oleg Shakirov>.

Holy fuck the type of data source that we get in this area of work!

This pastebin contained a few new hits, in addition to some pre-existing ones. Most of the hits them seem to be linked to the IP 72.34.53.174, which presumably is a major part of the fingerprint found by CYBERTAZIEX, though unsurprisingly methodology is unclear. As documented, the domains appear to be linked to a "Condor hosting" provider, but it is hard to find any information about it online.

From the title, it would seem that someone hacked into Condor and defaced all of its sites, including unknowingly some CIA ones which is LOL.

<Ciro Santilli> checked every single non-subdomain domain in the list.

Other files under the same account: https://pastebin.com/u/cybertaziex did not seem of interest.

The author's real name appears to be Deni Suwandi: https://twitter.com/denz_999 from <#Indonesia>, but all accounts appear to be inactive, otherwise we'd ping him to ask for more info about the list.

https://www.zone-h.com lists some of the domains. They also seem to have intended to have snapshots of the defaces but we can't see them which is sad:
* https://www.zone-h.com/mirror/id/18994983 Inspecting the source we see an image https://zonehmirrors.org/defaced/2013/01/14/vypconsulting.com//tmp/sejeal.jpg "Sejeal" "Memorial of Gaza Martyrs". Sejeal defacements are mentioned e.g. at:

  * https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/two-iranian-nationals-charged-cyber-theft-and-defacement-campaign-against-computer

= ipinf.ru
{parent=Data sources}

https://ipinf.ru

OK, <Oleg Shakirov's findings> inspired <Ciro Santilli> to try <Yandexing> a bit more...

`alljohnny.com` had a hit: https://ipinf.ru/domains/alljohnny.com/[], and so Ciro started looking around... and a good number of other things have hits.

Not all of them, definitely less data than <viewdns.info>.

But they do reverse IP, and they show which nearby reverse IPs have hits on the same page, for free, which is great!

Shame their ordering is purely alphabetical, doesn't properly order the IPs so it is a bit of a pain, but we can handle it.

OMG, <Russians>!!!

The data here had a little bit of non-overlap from other sources. 4 new confirmed hits were found, plus 4 possible others that were left as candidates.

= cqcounter
{parent=Data sources}

http://cqcounter.com has an exceptionally complete database containing:
* domains
* IP of the domain in the past e.g. http://cqcounter.com/whois/site/activegaminginfo.com.html which actually contains the IP 66.175.106.148!
* 727 x 545 screenshots from the past e.g. at: http://cqcounter.com/whois/www/activegaminginfo.com.html[]. These were also presumably meant to show as a thumbnail on the main page: http://cqcounter.com/whois/www/activegaminginfo.com.html[] but don't because it's buggy. It's not as good as the HTML from Wayback machine as we can't confirm comms like that, but still this can d help to verify if known in-range domains that the wayback machine didn't archive well (because it is buggy as hell?) have correct style and if they have anything fun in them. We are storing:
  * a backup of the screenshots at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/tree/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/screenshots/cqcounter
  * a list of their source URLs at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/cqcounter-images.txt This should be merged into hits.json but we are lazy.

Unfortunately I can't find a reverse IP search method.

And perhaps due to having lots of <CAPTCHAs>, Google doesn't seem to index that website very well... it even has a tiny screenshot! And it also shows some more metadata beyond IP, e.g. HTTP response headers, which notably contain stuff like `Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1`.

They seem to have an exceptionally complete database.

Both http://cqcounter.com/whois/www/teclafinance.com.html and http://cqcounter.com/whois/site/activegaminginfo.com.html both are broken, so it appears that their screenshot mechanism at the time did nor support Chinese characters well.

They also have some random localized versions:
* https://dawhois.com/site/activegaminginfo.com.html
* https://www.bgwhois.com/site/activegaminginfo.com.html
These can be useful if your IP gets blacklisted on the main site because you were checking too many sites.

As of 2025 they are marked at http://cqcounter.com/ as "Copyright 2000-2004".

= Reverse engineering
{parent=Methodology}

In this section we document the outcomes of more detailed inspection of both the communication mechanisms (<JavaScript>, <JAR (file format)>, swf) and <HTML> that might help to better fingerprint the websites.

= Communication mechanism
{parent=Reverse engineering}

= Comms
{synonym}
{title2}

There are four main types of communication mechanisms found:
* <Java> <JAR (file format)>

  There is also one known instance where a .zip extension was used! https://web.archive.org/web/20131101104829*/http://plugged-into-news.net/weatherbug.zip as:
  ``
  <applet codebase="/web/20101229222144oe_/http://plugged-into-news.net/" archive="/web/20101229222144oe_/http://plugged-into-news.net/weatherbug.zip"
  ``

  JAR is the most common comms, and one of the most distinctive, making it a great <fingerprint>.

  Several of the JAR files are named something like either:
  * meter.jar
  * bandwidth.jar
  * speed.jar
  as if to pose as Internet speed testing tools? The wonderful subtleties of the late 2000s Internet are a bit over our heads.

  All JARs are directly under root, not in subdirectories, and the basename usually consist of one word, though sometimes two camel cased.
* <JavaScript> file. There are two subtypes:
  * <JavaScript with SHAs>. Rare. Likely older. Way more fingerprintable.
  * JavaScript without SHAs. They have all been obfuscated slightly different and compressed. But the file sizes are all very similar from 8kB to 10kB, and they all look similar, so visually it is very easy to detect a match with good likelyhood.
* <Adobe Flash> swf file. In all instances found so far, the name of the SWF matches the name of the second level domain exactly, e.g.:
  ``
  http://tee-shot.net/tee-shot.swf
  ``
  While this is somewhat of a fingerprint, it is worth noting that is was a relatively commonly used pattern. But it is also the rarest of the mechanisms. This is a at a dissonance with the rest of the web, which circa 2010 already had way more SWF than JAR apparently.

  Some of the SWF websites have archives for empty `/servlet` pages:
  ``
  ./bailsnboots.com/20110201234509/servlet/teammate/index.html
  ./currentcommunique.com/20110130162713/servlet/summer/index.html
  ./mynepalnews.com/20110204095758/servlet/SnoopServlet/index.html
  ./mynepalnews.com/20110204095403/servlet/release/index.html
  ./www.hassannews.net/20101230175421/servlet/jordan/index.html
  ./zerosandonesnews.com/20110209084339/servlet/technews/index.html
  ``
  which makes us think that it is a part of the SWF system.
* <CGI comms>
These have short single word names with some meaning linked to their website.

Because the communication mechanisms are so crucial, they tend to be less varied, and serve as very good fingerprints. It is not ludicrous, e.g. identical files, but one look at a few and you will know the others.

= CGI comms
{parent=Communication mechanism}

= CGI
{synonym}

We've come across a few shallow and stylistically similar websites on suspicious ranges with this pattern.

No JS/JAR/SWF comms, but rather a subdomain, and an HTTPS page with .cgi extension that leads to a login page. Some names seen for this subdomain:
* `secure.`: most common
* `ssl.`: also common
* various other more creative ones linked to the website theme itself, e.g.:
  * musical-fortune.net has a backstage.musical-fortune.net

The question is, is this part of some legitimate tooling that created such patterns? And if so which? Or are they actual hits with a new comms mechanism not previously seen?

The fact that:
* hits of this type are so dense in the suspicious ranges
* they are so stylistically similar between on another
* citizenlabs specifically mentioned a "CGI" comms method
suggests to Ciro that they are an actual hit.

In particular, the `secure` and `ssl` ones are overused, and together with some heuristics allowed us to find our first two non Reuters ranges! <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census>{full}

Some currently known URLs
* https://backstage.musical-fortune.net/cgi-bin/backstage.cgi
* https://clients.smart-travel-consultant.com/cgi-bin/clients.cgi
* https://members.it-proonline.com/cgi-bin/members.cgi

* https://www.businessexchangetoday.com/cgi-bin/business.cgi
* https://heal.conquermstoday.com (path unknown)
If we could do a crawl search for `secure.*com/cgi-bin/*.cgi` that might be a good enough fingerprint, maybe even `*.*com/cgi-bin/*.cgi`. Edit: it is not perfect, but we kind of did it: <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census>{full}.

= CGI comms variant
{parent=CGI comms}

Later on, we've also come across some stylistic hits in IP ranges with apparent slight variations of the CGI comms pattern:
* no .cgi, but also http on subdomain:
  * dead:
    * https://web.archive.org/web/20100507132004/https://secure.developmental-league.com/login.html[]
    * https://web.archive.org/web/20110128182345/https://webmail.energy-bulb.com/login.html[]
    * https://web.archive.org/web/20110226074139/http://www.welcometonyc.net/login.html[]

    * https://web.archive.org/web/20090405045548/http://nouvelles-d-aujourdhuis.com/members.html[]
  * dead

    * https://web.archive.org/web/20110207150839/http://webofcheer.com/member.html[]
Since these are so rare, it is still a bit hard to classify them for sure, but they are of great interest no doubt, as as we start to notice these patterns more tend to come if it is a thing.

= JAR reverse engineering
{parent=Communication mechanism}

TODO it would be cool to have a look at the JARs and see if they have anything in common that makes for a good fringerprint. Would not help find new ones, but would help to confirm possible hits.

The most advanced reverse engineering effort so far has been by quat1024 on GitHub:
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/issues/203
* https://notes.highlysuspect.agency/cia-jars.html
He managed to deobfuscate the strings present inthe JARs using Enigma, possibly https://github.com/FabricMC/Enigma[], a Java reverse engineering tool. Cool findings on https://web.archive.org/web/20110208072027/http://newsupdatesite.com/update.jar include:
* `applet.configs1` deobfuscated contains a date:
  ``
   Fri Feb 05 12:04:29 EST 2010
  ``
  Also cool is the present of a timeszone, "EST" unsurprisingly.
* The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil

Some <reverse engineering> was done at: https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/1575505438111571969?lang=en[].

Notably, the password is hardcoded and its <hash> is stored in the JavaScript itself. The result is then submitted back via a POST request to `/cgi-bin/goal.cgi`.

TODO: how is the SHA calculated? Appears to be manual.

= feedsdemexicoyelmundo.com JavaScript reverse engineering
{parent=JavaScript reverse engineering}

The <JavaScript> of each website appears to be quite small and similarly sized. They are all minimized, but have reordered things around a bit.

For example consider: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202190932/http://feedsdemexicoyelmundo.com/mundo.js

First we have to know that the <Wayback Machine> adds some stuff before and after the original code. The actual code there starts at:
``
ap={fg:['MSXML2.XMLHTTP
``
and ends in:
``
ck++;};return fu;};
``

We can use a <JavaScript> beautifier such as https://beautifier.io/ to be abe to better read the code.

It is worth noting that there's a lot of `<script>` tags inline as well, which seem to matter.

Further analysis would be needed.

= Google searches for known domains and IPs
{c}
{parent=Methodology}

Googling most domains gives only very few results, and most of them are just useless lists of expired domains. Skipping those for now.

Googling `"dedrickonline.com"` has a git at https://www.webwiki.de/dedrickonline.com# Furthermore, it also contains the IP address "65.61.127.174" under the "Technik" tab!

Unfortunately that website appears to be split by language? E.g. the English version does not contain it: https://www.webwiki.com/dedrickonline.com[], which would make searching a bit harder, but still doable.

But if we can Google search those IPs there, we might just hit gold.

IP search did work! https://www.webwiki.de/65.61.127.174

But doesn't often/ever work unfortunately for others.

Searching on github.com: https://github.com/DrWhax/cia-website-comms by Jurre van Bergen from September 2022 contains some of the links to some of the ones reported by Reuters including some of their JARs, presumably for reversing purposees.

= Breakthroughs
{parent=Methodology}

Some less-trivial breakthroughs:
* finding <2013 DNS Census>
* <CGI comms> characterization
* <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census> let to a few hits
* <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup heuristic keyword searches> was massive and led to many new ranges

= Non Reuters ranges
{parent=Breakthroughs}

= secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census
{parent=Non Reuters ranges}

Grepping the <2013 DNS Census> first by overused <CGI comms> subdomains `secure.` and `ssl.` leaves 200k lines. Grepping for the overused "news" led to hits:
* secure.worldnewsandent.com,2012-02-13T21:28:15,208.254.40.117
* ssl.beyondnetworknews.com,2012-02-13T20:10:13,66.104.175.40

Also tried but failed:
* `sports`:
  * secure.motorsportdealers.com,2012-04-10T20:19:09,64.73.117.38 https://web.archive.org/web/20110501000000*/motorsportdealers.com[]

OK, after the initial successes in `secure.`, we went a bit more data intensive:
* took all `secure.*` `ssl.*` URLs in the <2013 DNS Census>, 70k entries
* cleaned up a bit, e.g. only `.com` or `.net`. this left only, 30k entries only
* lopped over all of them in archive CDX: <Wayback Machine CDX scanning>, searching for those that also end in `.cgi` https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=$domain&matchType=domain&filter=urlkey:.*.cgi&to=20140101000000[]. Took an afternoon, but no rate limit block.
* this leaves about 1000, so we loop over all of them manually on web archive with a script, and opened any that had the pattern of very vew hits between 2010 and 2013 only, and on those check for visual/thematic style match. Careful not to make more than 15 requests per minute or else 5 min blacklist!
New results: only one...

After <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup heuristic keyword searches> we later understood why there were so few hits here: the <2013 DNS Census> didn't capture the `secure.` subdomains of many domains it had for some reason. Shame, because if it had, this method would have yielded many more results.

Starting at https://twitter.com/shakirov2036/status/1746729471778988499[], <Russian> expat https://www.linkedin.com/in/shakirov/[Oleg Shakirov] comments "Let me know if you are still looking for the Carson website".

He then proceeded to <Searching for Carson>[give Carson] and 5 other domains in private communication. His name is given here with his consent. His advances besides not being blind were <Yandexing> for some of the known hits which led to pages that contained other hits:
* moyistochnikonlaynovykhigr.com contains a copy of myonlinegamesource.com, and both are present at https://www.seomastering.com/audit/pefl.ru/[], an SEO tracker, because both have backlinks to `pefl.ru`, which is apparently a niche fantasy football website
* 4 previously unknown hits from: <"Mass Deface III" pastebin>. He missed one which Ciro then found after inspecting all URLs on <Wayback Machine>, so leading to a total of 5 new hits from that source.

Unfortunately, these methods are not very generalizable, and didn't lead to a large number of other hits. But every domain counts!

{parent=Oleg Shakirov's findings}

Edit: Carson was found <Oleg Shakirov's findings>by https://www.linkedin.com/in/shakirov/[Oleg Shakirov]: `alljohnny.com`, communicated at: https://twitter.com/shakirov2036/status/1746729471778988499[], earliest archive from 2004 (!): https://web.archive.org/web/20040113025122/http://alljohnny.com/[], The domain was hidden in plain sight, it was present in a not very visible watermark visible in the <Reuters article> screenshot! The watermark was added to the <CIA> to the background image, it is actually present on the website. In retrospect, it was actually present at on the <expired domain trackers> dataset, but the mega discrete `all` second word made <Ciro Santilli> miss it: https://github.com/cirosantilli/expired-domain-names-by-day-2015/blob/9d504f3b85364a64f7db93311e70011344cff788/07/05/02#L1572

{title=2004 <Wayback Machine> archive of https://web.archive.org/web/20040113025122/http://alljohnny.com/[alljohnny.com]}
{height=717}

What follows is the previous

The fact that the <Reuters article> has a screenshot of it, and therefore a <Wayback Machine> link, plus the specificity of the website topic, will likely keep Ciro awake at night for a while until someone finds that domain.

Some text visible on the Reuters screenshot:
* > Johnny Carson and The Tonight Show
* > Your Favorite Host and Comedic Genius
* > Submit Your Favorite Carson Moment
* > Heeere's Johnny!

  Holy crap, the "Here's Johnny" line from The Shining (1980) is a reference to Johnny Carson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDpipB4yehk[], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYnyPAkgyvc[], Ciro never knew that... but every American would have understood it at the time.
It is unclear however if this text is plaintext or part of a an image.

Searching the <Wayback Machine> proved fruitless. There is no full text search: <Wayback Machine full text search>, and a heuristic https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/Johnny%20Carson search has relevant hits but not the one we want.

Another attempt was to search for "carson" on webmasterhome.cn which lists expired domains in bulk by expiration day, and it search engine friendly. It contains most of the domains we've found so far. <Google> either doesn't support partial word search or requires you to be a <God> to find it

so we settle for DuckDuckGo which supports it: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Awebmasterhome.cn+%22carson%22&t=h_&ia=web Adding years also helps: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Awebmasterhome.cn+%22carson%22+2011&ia=web with this we might be getting all possible results. Ciro went through all in 2011, 2012 and 2013 but no luck. Also fuck https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_City,_Nevada[] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California[] :-)

Let's search https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search for "carson" contained in any historic domain name. 10,001 lines. Grepping those, no good Wayback machine hits for those that also contain "johnny" or "show". Data at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/media/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/tools.whoisxmlapi.com_reverse-whois-search_carson.csv in case anyone want to try and dig...

Let's also search the fortuitously timed <2013 DNS Census>.

= Wakatime redirects
{c}
{parent=Work log}

Summary: this is just a red herring. Wakatime owner likely registered the domains just after this article was published as a <publicity stunt>. Fair play though.

As raised at: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36280666[], many, but not all, of the domains currently redirect to https://wakatime.com/[] as of 2023, and apparently they were taken up in 2013 (TODO how to confirm that). TODO what is the explanation for that? Some examples that do:
* http://dedrickonline.com
* http://tee-shot.net
But some failed resolution examples:
* http://pangawana.com/
* http://kessingerssportsnews.com/
Even more suspiciously, according to his LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanhamlett/[], the owner of Wakatime, Alan Hamlett, worked at WhiteHat Security, Inc from Aug 2011 - Sep 2013. The company was then acquired by Synopsys in 2022. Holy crap!!! As shown at: https://web.archive.org/web/20131013193406/https://www.whitehatsec.com/ that company made website security tools. Did that dude use the tools to find the vulnerabilty and then just gobble up all the domains??? What a fucking legend if he did!!!

Let's try:
* https://host.io/redirects/wakatime.com[]: failure
* https://www.whatsmydns.net/redirect-checker?q=wakatime.com[]: failure
* https://app.neilpatel.com/en/seo_analyzer/backlinks?domain=wakatime.com&mode=domain[]: failure

Running e.g.
``
curl -vvv dedrickonline.com
``
gives:
``
*   Trying 162.255.119.197:80...
* Connected to dedrickonline.com (162.255.119.197) port 80 (#0)

so we see that he must have setup redirection with Namecheap as mentioned at: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/385/2237/how-to-redirect-a-url-for-a-domain/

So these suggest Alan might have just come along in 2023 way after the 2022 Reuters article and did the same basic IP range search that Ciro is doing now, so possibly no new tech. Let's ask... https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1668369786865164289

The domain name history presented is however of interest, and could lead to patterns being found.

Searching https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search with term "Corral, Elizabeth" gave no results unfortunately.

Basic search under https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search for "Corral" also empty. They can't see their own data? Ah, need advanced. Marked "Historic" and selected "Corral, Elizabeth", ony one hit, activegaminginfo.com.

{parent=Work log}

Some dumps from us looking for patterns, but could not find any.

Sources of whois history include:
* https://whois-history.whoisxmlapi.com/ from <whoisXMLAPI>. Notably they also have historical reverse WHOIS... https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search but it needs credits. TODO we need to squeeze this a but further at some point.

When that data comes in JSON format as from <whoisXMLAPI>, we are going to just dump it in https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/whois.json[]

The vast majority of domains seem to be registered either via <domainsbyproxy.com> which likely intgrates with Godaddy and is widely used, and seems to give zero infromation at all about the registrar.

A much smaller number however uses other methods, some of which sometimes leak a little bit of data:
* <Network Solutions, LLC>. These sometimes give a tiny bit of information: one name. Other times they are hidden behind Perfect Privacy, LLC. Examples>
  * alljohnny.net: L. Glaze. https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search "Glaze, L." has

      * 65.218.91.9	United States	UUNET	2013-12-20 so matchwith welcometonyc.com but not listed at https://viewdns.info/reverseip/?t=1&host=65.218.91.9 because of the <viewdns.info reverse IP bug>!

There will be information on Lake Charles, Sulphur, Westlake, & Moss Bluff. If you have something you would like to see added to the website, please feel free to contact me!
    * mydailynewsreport.com. Hit.
  * plugged-into-news.net: Godfrey Hubbard. Searching https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search for two terms "Godfrey" "Hubbard" gives a small list of 20 domains including plugged-into-news.net. They all appear to have both words in them. Searching just "Hubbard, Godfrey" has only 3 hits:
    * hubbardgodfrey.online
    * plugged-into-news.net
    * hubbardgodfrey.com
    so it seems to match the strings exactly!
  but presumably these are the names of employees of the company? We are yet to see two identical names however, which also suggests fake names. Network Solutions appears to offer both hosting and domain registration, and the CIA seems to have used this service combo a lot.
* godaddy without <domainsbyproxy.com>: a few of the websites are registered in Godaddy without domainsbyproxy. These might be the ones that gives out the most information:
  * baocontact.com
Big question: https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/13237/how-do-you-view-domain-whois-history <DomainTools> also has it.

How on Earth did did Citizen Labs find what seems to be a DNS fingerprint??? Are there simply some very rare badly registered domains? What did they see!
