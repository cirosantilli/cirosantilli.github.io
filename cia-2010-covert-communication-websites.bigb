= CIA 2010 covert communication websites
{c}
{tag=Ciro Santilli's naughty projects}

This article is about <cutout (espionage)>[covert agent communication channel] websites used by the <CIA> in the late 2000s to early 2010s until they were uncovered by target countries. This discovery led to the imprisonment and execution of several assets in <Iran> and <China>.

The existence of such websites was first reported in November 2018 by Yahoo News: https://www.yahoo.com/video/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html[].

Then in September 2022 a few specific websites were reported by Reuteres in September 2022: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran/[].

When <Ciro Santilli> heard about the 2022 article almost a year later, he knew he had to try and find some of the domains himself! Given that it was reported that there were "more than 350" such websites, it would be really cool if we could uncover more of those websites ourselves beyond the 8 domains reported by Reuters! Notably, being <Brazilian>, <Ciro Santilli> is particularly curious about the existence of a Brazilian-focused website one mentioned in the article, as well as in other <democracies>. WTF the <CIA> was doing in Brazil in the early 2010s! Wasn't the <Military dictatorship in Brazil> enough!

Here's the list of probable candidates Ciro has found so far using only rudimentary IP range search on https://viewdns.info[] starting from the websites reported by Reuters, more details below. It is nothing compared to the hundreds of websites reported, so there must be key techniques missing, but the fact that there are no <Google Search> hits for the domains or IPs indicates that these might not have been previously clearly publicly disclosed.

If anyone can find others, or has better techniques, or wants to dump a bit of money on viewdns.info (only 250 queries per account which is very limiting): <contact>{full}.

https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/[] did an investigation and found 885 such websites, but decided not to disclose the list or methods:
\Q[
Using only a single website, as well as publicly available material such as historical internet scanning results and the <Internet Archive>'s <Wayback Machine>, we identified a network of 885 websites and have high confidence that the United States (US) Central Intelligence Agency (<CIA>) used these sites for covert communication.

The websites included similar <Java>, <JavaScript>, <Adobe Flash>, and CGI artifacts that implemented or apparently loaded covert communications apps. In addition, blocks of sequential IP addresses registered to apparently fictitious US companies were used to host some of the websites. All of these flaws would have facilitated discovery by hostile parties.

The websites, which purported to be news, weather, sports, healthcare, and other legitimate websites, appeared to be localized to at least 29 languages and geared towards at least 36 countries.

The bulk of the websites that we discovered were active at various periods between 2004 and 2013. We do not believe that the CIA has recently used this communications infrastructure. Nevertheless, a subset of the websites are linked to individuals who may be former and possibly still active intelligence community employees or assets:

* Several are currently abroad
* Another left mainland China in the timeframe of the Chinese crackdown
* Another was subsequently employed by the US State Department
* Another now works at a foreign intelligence contractor

Given that we cannot rule out ongoing risks to CIA employees or assets, we are not publishing full technical details regarding our process of mapping out the network at this time. As a first step, we intend to conduct a limited disclosure to US government oversight bodies.
]
OK, those people's techniques are way beyond <Ciro Santilli>'s!

The websites were used from at least as early as August 2008, as per Gholamreza Hosseini's account, and the system was only shutdown in 2013 apparently.

Notably, so as to be less suspicious the websites are often in the language of the country for which they were intended, so we can often guess which country they were intended for!

Highlights:
* IP 65.61.127.174: dedrickonline.com.2010 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20101211095158/http://www.dedrickonline.com/[]. <German (language)> (!) sports website. Possible hit. The CIA has had a few Germany espionage scandals in the 2010s:
  * 2014 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-28243933[]: a German Intelligence Agency agent was arrested for spying for the CIA
  * 2021 https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-security-agency-spied-merkel-other-top-european-officials-through-danish-2021-05-30/ U.S. spied on Merkel and other Europeans through Danish cables
  * 2020 https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-uss-cia-and-germanys-bnd-spied-on-world-leaders/a-52358527 it was revealed that Germany and the USA had an agreement to spy on world leaders, nobatly via compromised Swiss company Crypto AG

<Ciro Santilli> was already curious after hearing about the 2018 news, and even asked on <Quora>: https://www.quora.com/What-were-some-examples-of-the-websites-that-the-CIA-used-around-2010-as-a-communication-mechanism-for-its-spies-in-China-and-Iran-but-were-later-found-and-used-to-take-down-their-spy-networks[] but there were no publicly known domains at the time. But since the 2022 report when a few domains became available, it suddently became quite possible that we'd be able to realistically find more of them.

Reuters directly reported only two domains in writing:
* http://iraniangoals.com[]. Iranian language <football> website. As of 2023, the domain had been bought by Reuteres and redirects to otheir website.

  2009 archive: http://web.archive.org/web/20090411072857/http://iraniangoals.com/

  <JavaScript> file: http://web.archive.org/web/20110202091909/http://iraniangoals.com/journal.js

  Some <reverse engineering>: https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/1575505438111571969?lang=en[].

  Notably, the password is hardcoded and its <hash> is stored in the JavaScript itself. The result is then submited back via a POST request to `/cgi-bin/goal.cgi`.
* http://iraniangoalkicks.com[]. Iranian language <football> website. Available in GoDaddy as of 2023.

  2008 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20080211111124/http://iraniangoalkicks.com/

  <Java> <JAR (file format)> file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091917/http://iraniangoalkicks.com/clamping.jar

But by looking at the URLs of the screenshots they provided from other websites we can easily uncover all others that had screenshots, except for the Johnny Carson one, which is just generically named. E.g. the image for the Chinese one is https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/usa-spies-iran/screencap-activegaminginfo.com.jpg?v=192516290922 which leads us to domain http://activegaminginfo.com[].

Also none of those extra ones have any <Google> hits except for huge domain dumps, so maybe this counts as little bit of novel public research.

The full lits of domains from screenshots is:
* http://activegaminginfo.com[]: <Chinese (language)> gaming information website.

  2011 archive: http://web.archive.org/web/20110208113503/http://activegaminginfo.com/[]. Contains mentions of 2010.

  The website is entitled:
  \Q[活跃游戏]
  which means "Lively games", or "active games" as in the domain name itself.

  Available in GoDaddy as of 2023.

  <Java> JAR file: http://web.archive.org/web/20110202130304/http://activegaminginfo.com/gaming.jar
* http://capture-nature.com[]: <English (language)> photography website.

  2011 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20110201104659/http://capture-nature.com/[].

  As of 2023, it seemed to be an actual legit photography website by German (amateur?) photographer Klaus Wägele. Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20230323102504/https://www.capture-nature.com/

  <Ciro Santilli> actually sent him a message to let him know about the <CIA> thing in case he didn't, and he replied that he wasn't aware of it.

  <Java> JAR file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110201104851/http://capture-nature.com/Scenes.jar[].
* https://www.headlines2day.com/[]: Iranian language news website.

  2011 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20110201164741/https://www.headlines2day.com/[]. Dated "Copyright 2009".

  As of 2023, this was a completly broken-looking news website but in English entitled:
  \Q[Today's Headlines]
  2023 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20230121191348/https://www.headlines2day.com/[]. It makes one wonder if the <CIA> still operates it!

* http://rastadirect.net[]: English Rastafari culture website.

* http://fightwithoutrules.com[]: <Russian> fighting website.

  2011 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20110203021315/http://fightwithoutrules.com/[]. Contains mentions of 2009 news.

  Available as of 2023.

  <Java> JAR file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110203021403/http://fightwithoutrules.com/boxing.jar[].

Failed attempts at Johnny Carson:
* https://johnnycarson.com[]: official
* https://johnnycarson.net[]: fan site: https://web.archive.org/web/20010501225614/http://johnnycarson.net/
* http://johnnycarsontonight.com
* http://heresjohnny.com[]: squat https://web.archive.org/web/20130607145841/http://heresjohnny.com/
* "Your Favorite Host and Comedic Genius" searches are empty. Unclear if it is a image or actaully searchable.

This brings up to 8 known <domain names> with <Wayback Machine> archives, plus the yet unidentified Johnny Carlson one, which is also almost certainly is on Wayback Machine somewhere given that they have a screenshot of it.

From this we can establish see some clear stylistic trends across the websites:
* natural sounding, sometimes long-ish, English language domain names with 2 or 3 full words
* shallow websites with a few tabs, many external links, sometimes many images, and few internal pages
* common themes include:
  * news
  * hobbies, notably sports, travel and photography
* .com and .net <top-level domains>
* each one has one "communication mechanism file" which is either a:
  * <Java> <JAR (file format)>
  * <JavaScript> file
  * <Adobe Flash> swf file
  * HTML form on the website
  These have short single word names with some meaning linked to their website.

One promising way to find more of those would be with <IP> searches, since it was stated in the Reuter article that the <CIA> made the terrible mistake of using several contiguous IP blocks for those website. What a a phenomenal <OPSEC> failure!!!

The easiest way would be if <Wayback Machine> itself had an IP search function, but we couldn't find one: <Search Wayback Machine by IP>.

E.g. searching: https://viewdns.info/iphistory[] and considering only hits from 2011 or earlier we obtain:

Neither of these seem to be in the same ranges, the only common nearby hit amongst these ranges is the exact `68.178.232.100`, and doing reverse IP search at https://viewdns.info/reverseip/?host=68.178.232.100&t=1 states that it has 2.5 million hostnames on it, so it must be some kind of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service[Shared web hosting service], see also: https://superuser.com/questions/577070/is-it-possible-for-many-domain-names-to-share-one-ip-address[].
