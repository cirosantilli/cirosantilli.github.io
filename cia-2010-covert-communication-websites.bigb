= CIA 2010 covert communication websites
{c}
{tag=Ciro Santilli's naughty projects}
{tag=Open-source intelligence}
{scope}

This article is about <cutout (espionage)>[covert agent communication channel] websites used by the <CIA> in the late 2000s to early 2010s until they were uncovered by target countries. This discovery led to the imprisonment and execution of several assets in <Iran> and <China>.

The existence of such websites was first reported in November 2018 by Yahoo News: https://www.yahoo.com/video/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html[].

Then in September 2022 a few specific websites were reported by Reuters in September 2022: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran/[].

<Ciro Santilli> was already curious about those websites after hearing about the 2018 news, and even asked on <Quora>: https://www.quora.com/What-were-some-examples-of-the-websites-that-the-CIA-used-around-2010-as-a-communication-mechanism-for-its-spies-in-China-and-Iran-but-were-later-found-and-used-to-take-down-their-spy-networks[] but there were no publicly known domains at the time to serve as a starting point.

So <Ciro Santilli> heard about the 2022 article almost a year after publication, he <Ciro Santilli's naughty projects>[knew he had to try] and find some of the domains himself using the newly available information! It was an irresistible real-life <capture the flag (cybersecurity)>.

Given that it was reported that there were "more than 350" such websites, it would be really cool if we could uncover more of those websites ourselves beyond the 9 domains reported by Reuters! Notably, being <Brazilian>, <Ciro Santilli> is particularly curious about the existence of a Brazilian-focused website one mentioned in the article, as well as in other <democracies>. WTF the <CIA> was doing in Brazil in the early 2010s! Wasn't helping to install the <Military dictatorship in Brazil> enough! Democracies found so far, defining a democracy as a country with score 7.0 or more in the https://graphics.eiu.com/PDF/Democracy_Index_2010_web.pdf[Democracy index 2010].

In native language:
* <Germany> (1)
* <France> (2)
* <Italy> (2)
* <Brazil> (1)
* <Canada> (2)
* South Korea (1)
In English, so more deniable:
* <Japan> (1)
* Philippines (1)
* India (1)
"Almost democracies":
* Thailand (1)
* Peru (1)

This article documents the list of extremely likely candidates Ciro has found so far, mostly using only rudimentary IP range search on https://viewdns.info[] starting from the websites reported by Reuters, more details on methods also follow. It is still far from the https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/[885 websites reported by citizenlabs], so there must be key techniques missing. But the fact that there are no <Google Search> hits for the domains or IPs indicates that these might not have been previously clearly publicly disclosed. This investigation has brought the number to about 60 websites with Wayback Machine archives, compared to the original 8 published by Reuters without clear URLs.

If anyone can find others, or has better techniques, or wants to dump a bit of money on viewdns.info: <contact>{full}. viewdns.info only supports 250 free queries per IP which is very limiting. One option would be to <sponsor>[donate: \$39.95 to Ciro so he can make 2500 queries with the cheapest paid plan].

Disclaimer: the network fell in 2013, followed by fully public disclosures in 2018 and 2022, so I believe it is now more than safe for the public to know what can still be uncovered about the events that took place. The main author's political bias is <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[strongly pro-democracy and anti-dictatorship]. But https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/dictatorships-tend-to-work-together[democracies have to work together and build mutual trust, and not spy on one another].

If you want to go into one of the best <OSINT> <capture the flag (cybersecurity)>[CTFs] of your life, stop reading now and see how many Web Archives you can find starting only from the Reuters article as Ciro did. Some guidelines:
* there was no ultra-clean fingerprint found yet. Some intuitive and somewhat guessy data analysis was needed. But when you clean the data correctly and make good guesses, many hits follow, it feels so good
* paying for data was not required. But using cybercafe wifi's for a few extra IPs may help

= List of websites
{parent=CIA 2010 covert communication websites}

As a <CSV>: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.csv

Hit criteria: has <Wayback Machine> archive, and clear indication of a known <communication mechanism>. The mechanism itself doesn't need to be archived however, a link to it is enough given other supporting elements: IP range, site style, date, web archive date pattern. JS commons are always quickly visually inspected, other mechanisms we look only at filename patterns. Commented edge cases that didn't make the cut can be found mostly under <IP range search>{full} and <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup heuristic keyword searches>{full}.

The <Star Wars> one. Clearly branded websites like this are rare, which makes finding them all the much more fun. The Reuters article had two of them (<Searching for Carson>[Carson] and rastadirect.net), so these were probably manually selected from the full hit dataset, and did not serve specifically as entry points. Most of the websites are quite boring and forgetful as you'd expect.

The subtitle "Beyond The Unknown" may be a reference to the https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unknown_Regions[Unknown Regions] in the Star Wars fictional universe.

= Methodology
{parent=CIA 2010 covert communication websites}

= Gathering key points from the articles
{parent=Methodology}

https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/[] did an investigation and found 885 such websites, but decided not to disclose the list or methods:
\Q[
Using only a single website, as well as publicly available material such as historical internet scanning results and the <Internet Archive>'s <Wayback Machine>, we identified a network of 885 websites and have high confidence that the United States (US) Central Intelligence Agency (<CIA>) used these sites for covert communication.

The websites included similar <Java>, <JavaScript>, <Adobe Flash>, and CGI artifacts that implemented or apparently loaded covert communications apps. In addition, blocks of sequential IP addresses registered to apparently fictitious US companies were used to host some of the websites. All of these flaws would have facilitated discovery by hostile parties.

The websites, which purported to be news, weather, sports, healthcare, and other legitimate websites, appeared to be localized to at least 29 languages and geared towards at least 36 countries.
]

Another critical excerpt is:
\Q[
The bulk of the websites that we discovered were active at various periods between 2004 and 2013. We do not believe that the CIA has recently used this communications infrastructure. Nevertheless, a subset of the websites are linked to individuals who may be former and possibly still active intelligence community employees or assets:
* Several are currently abroad
* Another left mainland China in the time frame of the Chinese crackdown
* Another was subsequently employed by the US State Department
* Another now works at a foreign intelligence contractor
Given that we cannot rule out ongoing risks to CIA employees or assets, we are not publishing full technical details regarding our process of mapping out the network at this time. As a first step, we intend to conduct a limited disclosure to US government oversight bodies.
]
This basically implies that they must have found some communication layer level identifier, e.g. <IP> registration, <domain name> registration, or certificate because it is impossible to believe that real agent names would have been present on the website content itself!

The websites were used from at least as early as August 2008, as per Gholamreza Hosseini's account, and the system was only shutdown in 2013 apparently. https://citizenlab.ca/2022/09/statement-on-the-fatal-flaws-found-in-a-defunct-cia-covert-communications-system/ however claims that they were used since as early as 2004.

Notably, so as to be less suspicious the websites are often in the language of the country for which they were intended, so we can often guess which country they were intended for!

= The Reuters websites
{parent=Methodology}

Reuters directly reported only two domains in writing:
* http://iraniangoals.com[]. Iranian language <football> website. As of 2023, the domain had been bought by Reuters and redirects to their website.

  2009 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20090411072857/http://iraniangoals.com/

  <JavaScript> file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091909/http://iraniangoals.com/journal.js[] <Reverse engineering> information: <iraniangoals.com JavaScript reverse engineering>.
* http://iraniangoalkicks.com[]. Iranian language <football> website. Available in GoDaddy as of 2023.

  2008 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20080211111124/http://iraniangoalkicks.com/

  <Java> <JAR (file format)> file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091917/http://iraniangoalkicks.com/clamping.jar

But by looking at the URLs of the screenshots they provided from other websites we can easily uncover all others that had screenshots, <Searching for Carson>[except for the Johnny Carson one], which is just generically named. E.g. the image for the Chinese one is https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/usa-spies-iran/screencap-activegaminginfo.com.jpg?v=192516290922 which leads us to domain http://activegaminginfo.com[].

Also none of those extra ones have any <Google> hits except for huge domain dumps, so maybe this counts as little bit of novel public research.

The full lits of domains from screenshots is:
* http://activegaminginfo.com[]: <Chinese (language)> gaming information website.

  2011 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20110208113503/http://activegaminginfo.com/[]. Contains mentions of 2010.

  2011 archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20110201104659/http://capture-nature.com/[].

  As of 2023, it seemed to be an actual legit photography website by German (amateur?) photographer Klaus Wägele. Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20230323102504/https://www.capture-nature.com/

  <Ciro Santilli> actually sent him a message to let him know about the <CIA> thing in case he didn't, and he replied that he wasn't aware of it.

This brings up to 8 known <domain names> with <Wayback Machine> archives, plus the yet unidentified Johnny Carlson one, see also: <Searching for Carson>{full}, which is also almost certainly is on Wayback Machine somewhere given that they have a screenshot of it.

From this we can establish see some clear stylistic trends across the websites which would allow us to find other likely candidates upon inspection:
* natural sounding, sometimes long-ish, <domain names> generally with 2 or 3 full words. Most in English language, but a few in Spanish, and very few in other languages like French.
* shallow websites with a few tabs, many external links, sometimes many images, and few internal pages
* common themes include:
  * news
  * hobbies, notably sports, travel and photography. Golf seems overrepresented. Must be a thing over there in Langley.
* .com and .net <top-level domains>. <.org hits> is an open question.
* each one has one "communication mechanism file": <communication mechanisms>
* narrow page width like in the days of old, lots of images
* each hit domain is the only domain for its IP, i.e. the websites are all private hosted, no https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service[shared web hosting service] examples have been found so far
* banner composed of several long stripped images. Possibly to make reverse image search harder
The most notable dissonance from the rest of the web is that there are no commercial looking website of companies, presumably because it was felt that it would be possible to verify the existence of such companies.

= IP range search
{parent=Methodology}

One promising way to find more of those would be with <IP> searches, since it was stated in the Reuters article that the <CIA> made the terrible mistake of using several contiguous IP blocks for those website. What a a phenomenal <OPSEC> failure!!!

The easiest way would be if <Wayback Machine> itself had an IP search function, but we couldn't find one: <Search Wayback Machine by IP>.

https://viewdns.info is the only website that <Ciro Santilli> could find that contained such information.

E.g. searching: https://viewdns.info/iphistory[] and considering only hits from 2011 or earlier we obtain:

Neither of these seem to be in the same ranges, the only common nearby hit amongst these ranges is the exact `68.178.232.100`, and doing reverse IP search at https://viewdns.info/reverseip/?host=68.178.232.100&t=1 states that it has 2.5 million hostnames associated to it, so it must be some kind of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service[Shared web hosting service], see also: https://superuser.com/questions/577070/is-it-possible-for-many-domain-names-to-share-one-ip-address[], which makes search hard.

Ciro then tried some of the other IPs, and soon hit gold.

Initially, Ciro started by doing manual queries to viewdns.info/reversip until his IP was blocked. Then he created an account and used his 250 free queries with the following helper script: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh]. The output of that script can be seen at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media/blob/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh[].

Ciro then found <2013 DNS Census> which contained data highly disjoint form the viewdns-info one!

Summaries of the IP range exploration done so far follows, combined data from all databases above.

{tag=TODO}

Here we list domains for which the correct IP was apparently not found since there are no neighbouring hits.

These are suspicious, and suggest either that we didn't obtain the correct reverse IP, or a change in CIA methodology from an older time at which they were not yet using the obscene IP ranges.

It is interesting to note that Reuters seems to have featured disproportionately many hits from that range, one wonders why that happened. It is possible that they chose these because they actually didn't have any nearby hits to give away less obvious information, though they did pick some from the ranges as wel.

In what follows we list the domains with possible reverse IPs and what was explored so far for each. We consider IPs not in a range to be uncertain, and that instead their domains might have been previously in a range which we

= Searching for Carson
{parent=TODO}

The fact that Reuters has a screenshot of it, and therefore a <Wayback Machine> link, plus the specificity of the website topic, will likely keep Ciro awake at night for a while until someone finds that domain.

Some text visible on the Reuters screenshot:
* \Q[Johnny Carson and The Tonight Show]
* \Q[Your Favorite Host and Comedic Genius]
* \Q[Submit Your Favorite Carson Moment]
* \Q[Heeere's Johnny!]. Holy crap, the "Here's Johnny" line from The Shining (1980) is a reference to Johnny Carson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDpipB4yehk[], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYnyPAkgyvc[], Ciro never knew that... but every American would have understood it at the time.
It is unclear however if this text is plaintext or part of a an image.

Some failed attempts, either dry guesses or from DNS grepping dataset searches:

Searching the <Wayback Machine> proved fruitless. There is no full text search: <Wayback Machine full text search>, and a heuristic https://web.archive.org/web/20230000000000*/Johnny%20Carson search has relevant hits but not the one we want.

Another attempt was to search for "carson" on webmasterhome.cn which lists expired domains in bulk by expiration day, and it search engine friendly. It contains most of the domains we've found so far. <Google> either doesn't support partial word search or requires you to be a <God> to find it

so we settle for DuckDuckGo which supports it: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Awebmasterhome.cn+%22carson%22&t=h_&ia=web Adding years also helps: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Awebmasterhome.cn+%22carson%22+2011&ia=web with this we might be getting all possible results. Ciro went through all in 2011, 2012 and 2013 but no luck. Also fuck https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_City,_Nevada[] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California[] :-)

Let's search https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search for "carson" contained in any historic domain name. 10,001 lines. Grepping those, no good Wayback machine hits for those that also contain "johnny" or "show". Data at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/media/master/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/tools.whoisxmlapi.com_reverse-whois-search_carson.csv in case anyone want to try and dig...

Let's also search the fortuitously timed <2013 DNS Census>.

= Find missing hits in IP ranges
{parent=TODO}

All IP ranges have some holes in them for which we don't have a domain name.

It is because there was nothing there, or just because we don't have a good enough reverse IP database?

= How did Alexa find the domains?
{parent=TODO}

It can't be <HTML> crawl because presumably there wouldn't have been links to those websites? Presumably this is why <Common Crawl> doesn't seem to have any hits.

So they must have had some kind of DNS A record database?

Or would IPv4 sweep have worked, without the `Host` header with the CIA's setup?

The same question also applies to the <2013 DNS Census>. It has less hits, but still has many.

Whatever they did, we are so so glad that they did!

= Are there .org hits?
{parent=TODO}

= .org hit
{synonym}

There are a few .org potential hits in IP ranges of interst and stylistically correct. But unfortunately none of them have clear known <comms>, so we are not sure yet.

If true, .org would be very minoritary, and has been excluded from some of our heuristics, so it would be of interest to know if there are any.

* +23 212.4.17.61: tech-stop.org
* +14 65.61.127.177: material-science.org

= Data sources
{parent=Methodology}

= Wayback Machine
{parent=Data sources}

D'oh.

But to be serious. The Wayback Machine contains a very large proportion of all sites. It is the most complete database we have found so far. Some archives are very broken. But those are rares.

The only problem with the <Wayback Machine> is that there is no known efficient way to query its archives across domains. You have to have a domain in hand for CDX queries: <Wayback machine CDX scanning>.

The <Common Crawl> project attempts in part to address this lack of querriability, but we haven't managed to extract any hits from it.

CDX + <2013 DNS Census> + heuristics however has been fruitful however.

= Wayback Machine CDX scanning
{parent=Wayback Machine}

THe wayback machine has an endpoint to query cralwed pages called the CDX server. It is documented at: https://github.com/internetarchive/wayback/blob/master/wayback-cdx-server/README.md[].

This allows to filter down 10 thousands of possible domains in a few hours. But 100s of thousands would be too much. This is because you have to query exactly one URL at a time, and they possibly rate limit IPs. But no IP blacklisting so far after several hours, so it's not that bad.

Once you have a heuristic to narrow down some domains, you can use this helper: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/cdx.sh] to drill them down from 10s of thousands down to hundreds or thousands.

From then on, you can just manually inspect for hist on your browser.

= Wayback Machine crawl date search
{parent=Wayback Machine}

Many hits appear to happen on the same days, and per-day data does exist: https://archive.org/details/widecrawl but apparently cannot be publicly downloaded unfortunately. But maybe there's another way? TODO select candidates.

= viewdns.info
{parent=Data sources}

Their historic DNS and reverse DNS info was very valuable, and served as Ciro's the initial entrypoint to finding hits in the IP ranges given by Reuters.

Their data is also quite disjoint from the data of the <2013 DNS Census>. There is some overlap, but clearly their methodology is very different.

You can only get about 250 queries on the web interface, then 250 queries per free account via API.

We do API access to IP ranges with this simple helper: \a[cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/viewdns-info.sh].

They check your IP when you signup, and you can't sign in twice from the same IP. They also state that Tor addresses are blacklisted.

They also normalize dots in gmail addresses, so you need more diverse email accounts.

= 2013 DNS Census
{parent=Data sources}

Main article: </2013 DNS Census>.

This data source was very valuable, and led to many hits, and to finding the first non Reuters ranges with <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census>{full}.

Domain hit count when we were at 69 hits: 43. So it does contain more than half domains so far at that point. This was hackily determined with:
``
awk -F, '{ print $2 }' media/cia-2010-covert-communication-websites/hits.csv | xargs -I{} sqlite3 aiddcu.sqlite "select * from t where d = '{}'"
``
on a domain indexed dump.

The timing of the database is perfect for this project, it is as if the CIA had planted it themselves.

Hits as of 69 hits:

= 2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup
{parent=Data sources}

We've noticed that often when there is a hit range:
* there is only one IP for each domain
* there is a range of about 20-30 of those
and that this does not seem to be that common. Let's see if that is a reasonable fingerprint or not.

First we create a table `u` (`unique`) that only have domains which are the only domain for an IP, let's see by how much that lowers the 191 M total unique domains:
``
time sqlite3 u.sqlite 'create table t (d text, i text)'
time sqlite3 a.sqlite -cmd "attach 'u.sqlite' as u" "insert into u.t select min(d) as d, min(i) as i from t where d not like '%.%.%' group by i having count(distinct d) = 1"
``
The `not like '%.%.%'` removes subdomains from the counts so that <CGI comms> are still included, and `distinct` in `count(distinct` is because we have multiple entries at different timestamps for some of the hits.

Let's start with the 208 subset to see how it goes:
``
time sqlite3 a.sqlite -cmd "attach 'u.sqlite' as u" "insert into u.t select min(d) as d, min(i) as i from t where i glob '208.*' and d not like '%.%.%' and (d like '%.com' or d like '%.net') group by i having count(distinct d) = 1"
``
OK, after we fixed bugs with the above we are down to 4 million lines with unique domain/IP pairs and which contains all of the original hits! Almost certainly more are to be found!

So far, no new domains have been found with <Common Crawl>, nor have any existing known domains been found to be present in Common Crawl. Our working theory is that Common Crawl never reached the domains <How did Alexa find the domains?>

Let's try and do something with <Common Crawl>.

Unfortunately there's no <IP> data apparently: https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-index-table/issues/30[], so let's focus on the URLs.

Using their <Common Crawl Athena> method: https://commoncrawl.org/2018/03/index-to-warc-files-and-urls-in-columnar-format/

= tb0hdan/domains
{parent=Data sources}

Domain list only, no IPs. We haven't been able to extract anything of interest from this source so far.

Domain hit count when we were at 69 hits: 9, some of which had been since reused. Likely their data collection did not cover the dates of interest.

= Reverse engineering
{parent=Methodology}

In this section we document the outcomes of more detailed inspection of both the communication mechanisms (<JavaScript>, <JAR (file format)>, swf) and HTML that might help to better fingerprint the websites.

= Communication mechanism
{parent=Reverse engineering}

= Comms
{synonym}

There are four main types of communication mechanisms found:
* <Java> <JAR (file format)>

  There is also one known instance where a .zip extension was used! https://web.archive.org/web/20131101104829*/http://plugged-into-news.net/weatherbug.zip as:
  ``
  <applet codebase="/web/20101229222144oe_/http://plugged-into-news.net/" archive="/web/20101229222144oe_/http://plugged-into-news.net/weatherbug.zip"`
  ``
* <JavaScript> file. There are two subtypes:
  * <JavaScript with SHAs>. Rare. Likely older. Way more fingerprintable.
  * JavaScript without SHAs. They have all been obfuscated slighlty different. But the file sizes are all very similar from 8kB to 10kB, and they all look similar, so visually it is very easy to detect a match with good likelyhood.
* <Adobe Flash> swf file. In all instances found so far, the name of the SWF matches the name of the second level domain exactly, e.g.:
  ``
  http://tee-shot.net/tee-shot.swf
  ``
  a huge fingerprint. But it is also the rarest of the mechanism. This is a at a dissonance with the rest of the web, which circa 2010 already had more SWF than JAR apparently.
* <CGI comms>
These have short single word names with some meaning linked to their website.

Because the communication mechanisms are so crucial, they tend to be less varied, and serve as very good fingerprints. It is not ludicrous, e.g. identical files, but one look at a few and you will know the others.

= CGI comms
{parent=Reverse engineering}

We've come across a few shallow and stylistically similar websites on suspicious ranges with this pattern.

No JS/JAR/SWF comms, but rather a subdomain, and an HTTPS page with .cgi extension that leads to a login page. Some names seen for this subdomain:
* `secure.`: most common
* `ssl.`: also common
* various other more creative ones linked to the website theme itself, e.g.:
  * musical-fortune.net has a backstage.musical-fortune.net

The question is, is this part of some legitimate tooling that created such patterns? And if so which? Or are they actual hits with a new comms mechanism not previously seen?

The fact that:
* hits of this type are so dense in the suspicious ranges
* they are so stylistically similar between on another
* citizenlabs specifically mentioned a "CGI" comms method
suggests to Ciro that they are an actual hit.

In particular, the `secure` and `ssl` ones are overused, and together with some heuristics allowed us to find our first two non Reuters ranges! <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census>{full}

Some currently known URLs
* https://backstage.musical-fortune.net/cgi-bin/backstage.cgi
* https://clients.smart-travel-consultant.com/cgi-bin/clients.cgi
* https://members.it-proonline.com/cgi-bin/members.cgi

* https://ssl.newtechfrontier.com/cgi-bin/tech.cgi
* https://www.businessexchangetoday.com/cgi-bin/business.cgi
* https://heal.conquermstoday.com (path unknown)
If we could do a crawl search for `secure.*com/cgi-bin/*.cgi` that might be a good enough fingerprint, maybe even `*.*com/cgi-bin/*.cgi`. Edit: it is not perfect, but we kind of did it: <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census>{full}.

= CGI comms variant
{parent=CGI comms}

Later on, we've also come across some stylistic hits in IP ranges with apparent slight variations of the CGI comms pattern:
* no .cgi, but also http on subdomain:
  * dead:
    * https://web.archive.org/web/20100507132004/https://secure.developmental-league.com/login.html[]
    * https://web.archive.org/web/20110128182345/https://webmail.energy-bulb.com/login.html[]
* no subdomain, no https, no .cgi
  * live
    * https://web.archive.org/web/20091130144158/http://construction-zones.com/login.html[]
    * https://web.archive.org/web/20090405045548/http://nouvelles-d-aujourdhuis.com/members.html[]
  * dead
    * https://web.archive.org/web/20101230025246/http://guidetoelectronics.net/login.html[]
    * https://web.archive.org/web/20110128234749/http://messengergalaxy.com/login.html[]
Since these are so rare, it is still a bit hard to classify them for sure, but they are of great interest no doubt, as as we start to notice these patterns more tend to come if it is a thing.

= SSL certificate
{c}
{parent=CGI comms}

The <CGI comms> websites contain the only occurrence of HTTPS, so it might open up the door for a certificate fingerprint as proposed by user joelcollinsdc at: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36280801[]!

<JavaScript> file: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091909/http://iraniangoals.com/journal.js

Some <reverse engineering> was done at: https://twitter.com/hackerfantastic/status/1575505438111571969?lang=en[].

Notably, the password is hardcoded and its <hash> is stored in the JavaScript itself. The result is then submitted back via a POST request to `/cgi-bin/goal.cgi`.

= feedsdemexicoyelmundo.com JavaScript reverse engineering
{parent=JavaScript reverse engineering}

The <JavaScript> of each website appears to be quite small and similarly sized. They are all minimized, but have reordered things around a bit.

For example consider: https://web.archive.org/web/20110202190932/http://feedsdemexicoyelmundo.com/mundo.js

First we have to know that the <Wayback Machine> adds some stuff before and after the original code. The actual code there starts at:
``
ap={fg:['MSXML2.XMLHTTP
``
and ends in:
``
ck++;};return fu;};
``

We can use a <JavaScript> beautifier such as https://beautifier.io/ to be abe to better read the code.

It is worth noting that there's a lot of `<script>` tags inline as well, which seem to matter.

Further analysis would be needed.

= Google searches for known domains and IPs
{c}
{parent=Methodology}

Googling most domains gives only very few results, and most of them are just useless lists of expired domains. Skipping those for now.

Googling `"dedrickonline.com"` has a git at https://www.webwiki.de/dedrickonline.com# Furthermore, it also contains the IP address "65.61.127.174" under the "Technik" tab!

Unfortunately that website appears to be split by language? E.g. the English version does not contain it: https://www.webwiki.com/dedrickonline.com[], which would make searching a bit harder, but still doable.

But if we can Google search those IPs there, we might just hit gold.

IP search did work! https://www.webwiki.de/65.61.127.174

But doesn't often/ever work unfortunately for others.

Googling "activegaminginfo.com" has a git at: http://cqcounter.com/whois/site/activegaminginfo.com.html which actually contains the IP 66.175.106.148! But I can't find a reverse IP search method. And perhaps due to having lots of <CAPTCHAs>, Google doesn't seem to index that website very well... it even has a tiny screenshot! And it also shows some more metadata beyond IP, e.g. HTTP response headers, which notably contain stuff like `Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1`.

Forward search of expired domains appears to often work however, and contains correct IPs and the screenshots. Note that direct access as follows does not work for some reason, you have to type them into the search bar manually:

{parent=CIA 2010 covert communication websites}

Some less-trivial breakthroughs:
* finding <2013 DNS Census>
* <CGI comms> characterization
* <secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census> let to a few hits
* <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup heuristic keyword searches> was massive and led to many new ranges

= Non Reuters ranges
{parent=Breakthroughs}

= secure subdomain search on 2013 DNS Census
{parent=Non Reuters ranges}

Grepping the <2013 DNS Census> first by overused <CGI comms> subdomains `secure.` and `ssl.` leaves 200k lines. Grepping for the overused "news" led to hits:
* secure.worldnewsandent.com,2012-02-13T21:28:15,208.254.40.117
* ssl.beyondnetworknews.com,2012-02-13T20:10:13,66.104.175.40

Also tried but failed:
* `sports`:
  * secure.motorsportdealers.com,2012-04-10T20:19:09,64.73.117.38 https://web.archive.org/web/20110501000000*/motorsportdealers.com[]

OK, after the initial successes in `secure.`, we went a bit more data intensive:
* took all `secure.*` `ssl.*` URLs in the <2013 DNS Census>, 70k entries
* cleaned up a bit, e.g. only `.com` or `.net`. this left only, 30k entries only
* lopped over all of them in archive CDX: <Wayback machine CDX scanning>, searching for those that also end in `.cgi` https://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=$domain&matchType=domain&filter=urlkey:.*\.cgi&to=20140101000000[]. Took an afternoon, but no rate limit block.
* this leaves about 1000, so we loop over all of them manually on web archive with a script, and opened any that had the pattern of very vew hits between 2010 and 2013 only, and on those check for visual/thematic style match. Careful not to make more than 15 requests per minute or else 5 min blacklist!
New results: only one...
* 208.254.42.205 secure.driversinternationalgolf.com,2012-02-13T10:42:20,

After <2013 DNS Census virtual host cleanup heuristic keyword searches> we later understood why there were so few hits here: the <2013 DNS Census> didn't capture the `secure.` subdomains of many domains it had for some reason. Shame, because if it had, this method would have yielded many more results.

= Wakatime redirects
{c}
{parent=Work log}

Summary: this is just a red herring. Wakatime owner likely registered the domains just after this article was published as a <publicity stunt>. Fair play though.

As raised at: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36280666[], many, but not all, of the domains currently redirect to https://wakatime.com/[] as of 2023, and apparently they were taken up in 2013 (TODO how to confirm that). TODO what is the explanation for that? Some examples that do:
* http://dedrickonline.com
* http://tee-shot.net
But some failed resolution examples:
* http://pangawana.com/

Even more suspiciously, according to his LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanhamlett/[], the owner of Wakatime, Alan Hamlett, worked at WhiteHat Security, Inc from Aug 2011 - Sep 2013. The company was then acquired by Synopsys in 2022. Holy crap!!! As shown at: https://web.archive.org/web/20131013193406/https://www.whitehatsec.com/ that company made website security tools. Did that dude use the tools to find the vulnerabilty and then just gobble up all the domains??? What a fucking legend if he did!!!

Let's try:
* https://host.io/redirects/wakatime.com[]: failure
* https://www.whatsmydns.net/redirect-checker?q=wakatime.com[]: failure
* https://app.neilpatel.com/en/seo_analyzer/backlinks?domain=wakatime.com&mode=domain[]: failure

Running e.g.
``
curl -vvv dedrickonline.com
``
gives:
``
*   Trying 162.255.119.197:80...
* Connected to dedrickonline.com (162.255.119.197) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: dedrickonline.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.88.1
> Accept: */*

* Connection #0 to host dedrickonline.com left intact
``
so we see that he must have setup redirection with Namecheap as mentioned at: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/385/2237/how-to-redirect-a-url-for-a-domain/

Let's also try <DNS> history

So these suggest Alan might have just come along in 2023 way after the 2022 Reuters article and did the same basic IP range search that Ciro is doing now, so possibly no new tech. Let's ask... https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1668369786865164289

The domain name history presented is however of interest, and could lead to patterns being found.

Searching https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search with term "Corral, Elizabeth" gave no results unfortunately.

Basic search under https://tools.whoisxmlapi.com/reverse-whois-search for "Corral" also empty. They can't see their own data? Ah, need advanced. Marked "Historic" and selected "Corral, Elizabeth", ony one hit, activegaminginfo.com.

Some dumps from us looking for patterns, but could not find any.
