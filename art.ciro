Stuff that is beautiful but useless because it does not make food or houses cheaper.

Or from \x[ciro-santilli-s-best-random-thoughts]:
\Q[Without technology, one cannot survive. Without art, one cannot live.]

But that sure enough has a \x[jesus] semi-precursor, and likely many others: \x[man-shall-not-live-by-bread-alone].

There is some art however that lives in the fine intersection between beauty and usefulness:

Maybe those are genial. Maybe not. Nostalgia is just too strong to discern. Ciro still goes back to them for rest.

= Children cartoons Ciro Santilli liked to watch
{parent=art-young-ciro-santilli-consumed}

These did not stand the test of time however.

When Ciro was ten years old, he was addicted to 2 cartoons: \x[pokemon] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z[Dragon Ball Z]!

Pokemon had just launched in Brazil in 1999, 2 years after the Japanese launch: https://br.historyplay.tv/hoje-na-historia/comeca-exibicao-original-do-anime-pokemon (http://web.archive.org/web/20191221091947/https://br.historyplay.tv/hoje-na-historia/comeca-exibicao-original-do-anime-pokemon[archive]) And dragon Ball, was first aired in 1989 in Japan! My God, those translations took forever back then!

And \i[everyone] was playing Pokemon on their https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color[Game Boy Color]. Ciro was \x[ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology][already cheap] however, and didn't buy the console despite wanting it, and just played it through his friends handhelds. But maybe this is a good thing. Playing alone sucks.

Watching Dragon Ball Z now feels like watching paint dry, everything takes forever! Apparently padding to sync with the manga: https://www.quora.com/Why-does-DBZ-drag-on-for-so-long The original https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball[Dragon Ball] was likely strictly better, as it was much more fun and took itself less seriously. Also in DBZ https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep[power level inflation] is taken to ridiculous levels. This is why https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Punch_Man[One-Punch Man] is good. Out of all evil characters, https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Frieza[Frieza] is one that made a big impression on Ciro, his graphical design is so good.

= Games young Ciro Santilli played
{parent=art-young-ciro-santilli-consumed}

Mostly \x[video-game]{p} of course.

First when he was really young, about 5, Ciro played a lot of NES, but he doesn't remember things from that era very well. Contra, Ninja Turtles, Battle Tanks, Duck Hunt, and some modern "real world jet" top to bottom rail shooter (TODO identify) are definitely some of the games he clearly remembers playing, see also: \x[image-five-year-old-ciro-santilli-playing-nes-on-a-joystick].

As an honorable mention, Ciro remembers his teenage/young adult neighbours playing some \x[dos] games on their computer. Those games felt so incredibly advanced, including the required setup to play them. It felt like some kind of black magic! But Ciro didn't really play them however.

Ciro then skipped the \x[snes] and handhelds, which he played only through friends because he \x[ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology][was cheap] (but also because Brazil is a poor country remember, and imports are pretty expensive). He clearly remembers playing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World[Super Mario World] for the SNES and \x[children-cartoons-ciro-santilli-liked-to-watch][Pokemon on friends' Gameboys] of course.

Ciro then went straight to 5th generation with the \x[nintendo-64]{child} in 1994 which his parents bought for him during a trip to the \x[united-states]. Once again, because he was cheap, the only game he bought was \x[super-mario-64], which likely came with the console? He played that game to death.

Then came https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time[Ocarina of Time], which blew everyone's minds, and Ciro would go to Blockbuster to rent it for the weekend, and again play to death with his friends. You had to arrive early at Blockbuster to rent it, otherwise other people would rent all copies!!!

The only time Ciro got robbed as of 2020 was when an older teenager stopped his bicycle in front of Ciro and took his rented Golden Eye 64 copy away from his hand, and run off. Poor drug addict.

Ciro always felt that the PS1 had a much uglier aesthetics than the N64, and didn't like the console. Playing a bit of \x[final-fantasy-vi]{child} on his memory did stick deeply to his mind however. Ciro later played all good PS1 RPGs on emulation during \x[university-of-sao-paulo] during amazing solitary nights.

And on the PC, Ciro was particularly touched by \x[age-of-empires-ii] and \x[diablo-ii].

As a young teenager Ciro would also play \x[counter-strike] with his friends at LAN houses. Playing that game would make Ciro extremely anxious, his hands got all cold, and it was a lot of fun.

After this Ciro grew up and notice that the only fun game is that of becoming \x[ciro-santilli-s-selfish-desires][become rich and famous] in the real world.

This explains however Ciro's \x[tool-assisted-speedrun] interests.

Outside of video games, Ciro got midly addicted to \x[magic-the-gathering] in his early teens.

= Pokemon

{parent=games-young-ciro-santilli-played}
{wiki=Pokémon}

One of the main \x[children-cartoons-ciro-santilli-liked-to-watch].

Ciro could not understand why Nintendo won't make a proper 3D https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game[MMORPG] Pokemon with actually 3D Pokemon roaming the land, which is obviously what everyone wants. There are even fan games getting there!
* https://pokemon-mmo-3d.com Interesting concept here, where when you deploy a Pokemon, you start controlling the Pokemon rather than the main character
* https://www.quora.com/Why-won-t-Nintendo-make-an-open-world-3D-Pokémon-RPG/answer/Ciro-Santilli
until this explaiend it beautifully \x[video-the-downfall-of-mainline-pokemon-games-by-gonz-media-2020]:
* Pokemon became an \x[industrialized] yearly game spitting machine, and therefore any new feature is just extra risk
* Pokemon was kept mostly as a handheld exclusive to sell handlhelds, with a few early exceptions such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Snap[Pokemon Snap]

This is a \x[neologism] by \x[ciro-santilli], it refers to the fact that \x[zatoichi] was not fully blind, but extremely hard of sight, which makes him:
* too capable for the blind people, who did not trust him
* too incapable for non-blind people, who despised him
and metaphorically refers to similar situations where a person or group of people are in the middle of two groups and not part of either of them.

A related thing that comes to mind is \x[aum-shinrikyo]'s \x[prophet] \x[shoko-asahara], who was semi blind, and would bully the fully blind people of his school for blind people.

That makes \x[ciro-santilli] most mad about this film is the fact that the dude was passionate about writing, and when he became a genius, rather than write the best novels ever written, he decided instead to play the \x[stock-market] instead. This paints an accurate picture of 2020's society, where finance jobs make infinitely more money than other real engineering jobs, and end up attracting much of the talent.

Another enraging thing is how his girlfriend starts liking him again once he is a genius, and instead of telling her to fuck off, he stays with her.

The other really bad thing is the ending. He fixed the drug by himsef? He scared off De Niro just like that?

= Ciro Santilli's film tastes
{parent=cinema}

\x[ciro-santilli] has already watched all \x[the-best-films-of-all-time][the best films in history], and as a result any of those new movies that is full of clichés and has no innovative aspect at all (99.99999% of all modern movies) makes Ciro want to puke and to start \x[googling] \x[tv-tropes] to classify as many clichés as possible.

Good movies are those that teach you mechanisms of the real world. https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief[Willing suspension of disbelief] must be maintained at all costs.

Or of what could happen a world where a single sci-fi element is added and explored to its limits.

Love is not an interesting aspect of the world. You solve your love life \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][at university], Tinder or Tango.

The actually interesting aspects of the world are:
* business
* war
* \x[crime-film][crime]
* government
* science

Movies with a lot of action scenes, with exception of some war movies, are \x[shit].

The \x[sliding-scale-of-idealism-vs-cynicism] must be close to Cynicism max at all times. Movies with pure good and pure bad are \x[shit].

Knowing spoilers has no effect in the film's enjoyment. The interest of storyline concepts is all that matters, visuals and acting are useless.

= High budget movies are shit
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-film-tastes}

Movies that are very expensive to make tend to be bad, because they have to make returns and thus appeal to a large amorphous population without any specialization, i.e. the \x[lowest-common-denominator] but in \x[tv-tropes] terminology rather than \x[mathematics]: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator[].

\x[ciro-santilli] likes this.

He doesn't have the patience to actually watch full episodes with rare exceptions, rather just watching selected scenes from: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdeIGY2DIjpGf0A2m9GSE3g[], but still, it is interesting.

What appeals to Ciro in this series is how almost nothing is solved by violence, almost everything is decided in the bridge, at the "cerebral" level of the command structure. This reminds Ciro of a courtroom of law sometimes.

Maybe there's also a bit of 90's nostalgia involved too though, as this is something that would show on some random cable channels a bored young Ciro would have browsed during weekends, never really watching full episodes.

One crime of many episodes is being completely based on some stupid new scientific concept, which any character to back it up.

Another thing that hurt is that due to their obsession with the senior members of the crew, sometimes those senior members are sent in ridiculously risky operations, which is very unrealistic.

Episodes that Ciro watched fully and didn't regret:
* s02e09 Measure of a man https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Measure_of_a_Man_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation) see also \x[physics-and-the-illusion-of-life]

* s04e15 First contact https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Contact_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)[]. Although the premise that the aliens look so much like humans, and worse, that Decker could speak their language to the point of passing as one of their race is preposterous, the idea of inversion of first contact is just too cute.
* s07e15 The Lower Decks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Decks_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)[], \x[sliding-scale-of-idealism-vs-cynicism] near cynincism, yes please

Semi worth it:

= Magic: The Gathering
{c}
{parent=trading-card-game}
{tag=good-video-game-to-watch}
{wiki}

Magic is the best card game of all time. \x[ciro-santilli] agrees with this fact, and this \x[games-young-ciro-santilli-played][has nothing to do with the nostalgia factor of having played it while being a teenager].

It is also the one with the most cumbersome name possible, containing even a \x[bloody] colon punctuation in it!

However, besides that, Magic has another major flaw: the cards of old formats (Legacy and Modern), which are the only really interesting ones, are \x[fucking] expensive. Ciro thinks this is idiotic, and that Wizards should sell all cards individually with unlimited supply and all with the same prices, especially online where there are no printing costs. But because Wizards made the silly promise never to reprint certain cards with the https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Reserved_List[reserved list] in 1994, they can't even correct this mistake \x[legally]! (TODO maybe, see further discussion at: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/contract-from-below-promissory-estoppel-and-the-reserved-list[]). There is however one simple solution: create and promote a new no reserve list format, and let reserve list formats rot away:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIq0NWSLAJA Magic TV - A Look at Non Reserve List Legacy by ChannelFireball (2015). Notably, they suggest the workaround of printing very slightly differently functional reprints, e.g. "Snow covered duals". Genius.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/8gtoj4/no_reserve_list_legacy/
One interesting outcome of this would be to have card cost limited formats. https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Penny_Dreadful[Penny Dreadful] puts a super low limit, on individual cards, but it would be cool to have a max cost per deck version of it.

A cool thing is when they printed http://www.magicspoiler.com/mtg-spoiler/garth-one-eye/[Garth One-Eye], which allows you to make imaginary copies of some of those restricted list cards during play. This is the type of "flirting with the rules", that \x[ciro-santilli] admires. The introduction of online-only cards such as XXX has pushed that even further as of 2021.

This was especially insane when Ciro was young and the Internet was not very widely available in Brazil yet, and Ciro did not know how to check the values of cards on online markets, and would trade cards with older much more knowledgable teenagers, based solely on his appraisal of a card's strength! Can you imagine how many young https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Timmy[Timmys] got ripped off in this manner, trading useless one million mana spells for ultra expensive https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Nine[black lotuses]?

Another option we could pursue would be to make governments consider TCG pack opening a form of gambling, which it obviously is:
* https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Pokémon-card-collecting-not-considered-gambling-when-the-pack-of-cards-one-purchases-is-a-game-of-chance
* https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/7fx3no/are_trading_card_games_gambling/

There is however one good solution to Magic's insane cost: watch people who have nothing better to do in their lives play on \x[youtube].

And as Internet formats dominate more and more, if they have any brains at will they will migrate to a subscription model where you pay to play for a given period of time, and have immediate access to all cards. It could even be a tiered access, with older formats being more expensive (more bugs to fix on different cards), but you must get access to all cards of a format at once.

Like in \x[mathematics], the most beautiful decks are those that do \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-creative-personality][crazy things]:
* infinite combos
* semi-infinite combos that allow you to likely draw your entire deck or deal 20 damage
* all-in decks that either win or lose on turn two
* and lands
All of this comes to a certain extent from the deep https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_game[asymmetry] that permeates the game.

It is also really interesting to watch as new sets as spoiled and try to guess if certain cards will have any impact on the Modern or Legacy metagame.

Here are some cool decks:
* Cheerios, Modern. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkjY7VWZC3o[Meryn MTG, 2019]
* Lands, Legacy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9Pxen2CZlg[Channel Mengucci, 2019]
* Belcher, Legacy, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajJG11AI88o[Jeff Hoogland, 2019], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egGw0aWYsdc[Channel Mengucci, 2017]
* Ops All Spells

  \Video[http://youtube.com/watch?v=uFHtX4Agv4U]
  {title=Ops All Spells - Legacy | Channel Mengucci.}
* Gyruda Cannon - Legacy - April 18th, 2020 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PefRTsRRi6w

If Ciro were to ever overcome \x[ciro-santilli-s-cheapness][his cheapness] and play the legacy forma (which will never happen), he would likely play one of the following decks when trying to be able to win at all:
* https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/turbo-depths[turbo depths]
* https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/sneak-and-show[sneak and show]
Both of this decks focus on cheating a huge creature into play in one go, and both have combo protection methods (discard for turbo depths, and counterspells for sneak and show). Ciro believes that those decks reflect his personality well, notably \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-creative-personality]. Related decks that don't appeal as much to Ciro:
* https://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/reanimator[reanimator]: you have to worry about graveyard hate all the time, worrying is bad
* https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2888239[storm]: you have to play too many spells, it's tiring. Ciro would rather put a fattie into play and swing once.
And above all, Ciro would never play a fair deck. Grinding victories is not for him. He'd rather quickly decide win/lose status and move on.

Competitive commander is also interesting, although matches tend to be much more random so the format is harder to digest, see for example this channel; https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCum8N4KUUC0l_NK_mybvilg[Playing With Power MTG channel].

In Ciro's mind, https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Urza%27s_block[Urza's block] is the most epic of all, followed by the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masques_block[masques block]. Those sets had a ridiculous power level and epic art, and they happened just before \x[ciro-santilli] started playing during https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_(Magic:_The_Gathering)[Invasion], which had an extremely low power level in comparison. So Ciro saw some cards from those slightly older formats floating around, but not many, and they felt so mystical and awesome.

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVmqfvWsKeFaMGY68CbcVVQ[ChannelFireball] is one of the best Legacy resources out there, but they have too much crap filling in between legacy videos unfortunately.

The following creators share many of Ciro's interests and output large quantities of interesting content covering all memes/overpowered combos of new sets:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u5yzmta2oA BoshNRoll (Brian Coval) is basically \x[ciro-santilli]'s favorite MTG streamer of the early 2020's very good Legacy focused content, with occasional Modern and Pauper, good spicy deck selection. And he says nice and intelligent things the hole time, it's the type of person Ciro would be good friends with in real life. It sometimes makes Ciro said to see such a person wasting their lives with Magic. Twitter: https://twitter.com/BoshNRoll
* \x[magic-aids]
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChw6Y6UYf6fIipBEWg6iEaw[Squa Chief]. He does a lot of cool decks.
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0OFObRNMjSsnuEMGA-K29Q[Jeff Hoogland]. Not Ciro's favorite personality though, too rambly/matter-of-fact. Also was going too much into MTGA.
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2hkmJr2x--IiMfozqj6VdQ Meryn MTG. She's too much on the jank side for Ciro's taste, but for that reason she covers some decks of interest that others don't. She's cute, and a Timmy at heart. Which makes you feel really sorry for her as she gets crushed by more competitive decks.
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLYO-CiS0e8Yhs-U1k6ZmXQ[CalebD]. Legacy and Modern. Too much drafting in the middle of actual videos. Sometimes decks slightly too janky/experimental. Amazing channel soundtrack.
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYwlc3jRrZqNNTPw3Lyl6wQ[Nikachu] has some decent commentary. His endlessly rambly persona is a bit annoying, but the content of the commentary is still good.

Another amazing channel is Alpha Investments: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTp-iVOtTrKau0skmfZlo5Q[] due to content that gives some idea of the behind the scenes of card trading, e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN7zpKoRXeg "Spending \$500,000 per month on Pokemon & Magic". Ciro feels that such lessons can have applicability in business outside of the Magic The Gathering context as well.

Ciro was pleased when he learnt that \x[steve-wozniak-plays-magic-the-gathering].

Magic's competitive play became a mess in the late 2010's. They had a clear tournament structure, but they decided to start changing things every 6 months, and give tournaments meaningless names like "Mythic championship", and it just became impossible to follow what is what.

* https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_PT_events
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXUHaXiZ0HI The Moment Professional Magic Came to an End by Nikachu MTG (2021) has a good perspective. Magic is never going to have enough viewers to actually allow pros to make consistent ammounts money. And Magic's variability is just way too high for anyone to consistently win few large prizes on annual contests. Therefore they just killed such contests.

Ciro had initially \x[googled] for the "4-card limit thought experiment" but he reached: https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/what-if-the-4-card-limit-was-abolished-in-modern/ "What if the 4-Card Limit Was Abolished in Modern?" by Frank Karsten (2018) and was much more pleased with the mathematical result. Like-minded people.

That links to https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/what-if-the-4-card-limit-was-abolished-in-modern/ the related article: "The Mythic Invitational's Duo Standard Format Game Theory Optimized" by Frank Karsten (2019) which explains well how Nash equilibrium is naturally reached: if there is any imbalance, someone can take advantage of it, and then it rebalances. Therefore once you've calculated the equilibrium, your best course of action is to pick a deck at random from a list of possible winners.

Of course, part of the beauty of Magic is that we can never really know the full matrix since deck choice is basically infinite. But at the very least it could give good archetype results.

\x[ciro-santilli] used to \x[games-young-ciro-santilli-played][play video games when he was young]. But after he reached 18 he got bored of them.

The problem is that no matter how you look at, the \x[ciro-santilli-s-selfish-desires][how to become famous in the real world game] is just always more interesting and fulfilling.

Therefore adult Ciro enjoys only the following types of video game content in video form, so that other people waste their lives playing the games while you only see the highlights:
* \x[speedrunning], including:
  * \x[tool-assisted-speedrun], Ciro's favorite by far
  * \x[real-time-attack-speedrun]
* \x[meta-breaking-glitch]{p}, including in \x[speedrunning] and on \x[pvp]-games.
* \x[magic-the-gathering]
* \x[video-game-review]{p}

The aspect Ciro enjoys about non-\x[pvp] games is atmosphere. Not as conveyed by useless story telling, but as conveyed by music and graphics, and the context deep idea. Legend of Zelda and Metroid come to mind.

And too many games commit the sins of dependency of dexterity, no save states, how do I skip this boring part, or jump straight to the beautiful one?

Ciro once commented that the best game is an infinitely hard one, where you can progress infinitely. To which hist friend J. replied:
\Q[Fine, so the perfect game for you is \x[mathematics]. Stage one: prove the \x[riemann-hypothesis]!]
But this is basically what Ciro feels on every video game. It happens too often on \x[player-versus-environment][pve] games that things are is either:
* too slow and easy (Ciro would rather skip those with saves made by other)
* or too fast hard, Ciro would rather \x[tool-assisted-speedrun] those parts
Not to mention the incredible breach of \x[suspension-of-disbelief] of most PvE games where enemies are unbelievably stupid. E.g., why doesn't Bowser just build one fucking wall 15 tiles high to prevent Mario from coming through to his castle? And then put a gate and a hundred guards in front of it? TODO there was a YouTube video of this, I think it was Toad pointing it out to Mario that it is quite weird that Bowser is so stupid, it almost feels like he wants to be beaten.

It also doesn't help if you are already typing on a computer all day long on your job. Hands get tired. Eyes have an infinite capacity to consume useless \x[the-best-youtube-channels][YouTube videos] however. Medically proved.

As a result, Ciro just watches videos about video games. Notably games he played when he was a teenager and already understand the rules for.

And things got even worse as after \x[ciro-santilli-s-open-source-enlightenment], and he started to feel bad about playing \x[open-source-video-game][any game that is not open source].

= Meta breaking glitch
{parent=video-game}

A meta breaking \x[glitch] of a \x[video-game] is a glitch that when discovered significantly \x[breaks-the-meta].

In non-\x[video-game]-game, it does sometimes happen that a meta is broken as well, but these events tend to be rarer and less dramatic than meta-breaking due to \x[computer-program] glitches.

In \x[pvp] games, those glitches are generally forbidden by existing rules, and quickly patched after discovered.

In \x[speedrunning] however, they are either incorporated in the existing strategy, or may lead to the creation of a new run category for particularly significant glitches.

A non-\x[tool-assisted-speedrun].

\x[ciro-santilli] views humans as \x[human-brain][biological robots], and therefore RTA videos can be thought of as probabilistic TAS with human achievable reflex constraints.

This aspect is especially highlighted in "speed run record evolution videos", which can be quite fun, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmS9e7kzgS4 Ocarina of Time - World Record History and Progression (Any% Speedrun, 1990s-2017) by retro (2017)

From a similar point of view, Ciro also sometimes watches/learns a bit about competitive \x[pvp] games from a \x[large-cohesive-game-world-for-robotic-like-artificial-intelligence-development]["could a computer play this better than a human"] point of view.

Ciro also likes to watch commented manual speedruns of games as a way of experiencing the game at a high level without spending too much time on it, often from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_Done_Quick[Games Done Quick]. Their format is good because it generally showcases one player focusing more on the gameplay, and three couch commentators to give context, that's a good setup.

To some extent, the ultimate achievement of a TAS is to achieve \x[arbitrary-code-execution] (ACE) on a game, although this has been becoming rarer and rarer in newer consoles. The \x[nintendo-64] is the current interesting ACE discovery frontier as of 2020.

Post ACE, you then get into more subtle categories which tend to be more geometric clipping through wall glitches, but those can still be fun.

Why would anyone ever waste time playing a closed source game, when this will inevitably lead to endless hours of decompilation down the line when you want to:
* fully understand how the game works, notably to help with \x[tool-assisted-speedrun][TASsing]
* improve the game's flaws as devs drop support (https://www.vg247.com/2018/09/14/isnt-ps4-xbox-switch-port-final-fantasy-8-preservation-may-answer/[or lose source code and have to late \x[reverse-engineering][reverse-engineer] their own fucking game]?) :-)

Those who devote their time to the \x[art][useless] development of open source video games, \x[integrated-development-environment][before we even have decent open source development tooling], will, without a doubt, have their place in Heaven.

This is the one that hit \x[ciro-santilli] the hardest, coming in at the point in which he started to discern between games and the real world a little better. His parents bought it for him during a trip to Disney World in Florida in 1996 (?), since electronics were much cheaper in the \x[usa].

So as Ciro became older, and turned into a \x[software-engineer], he started to become more and more morbidly curious about "N64 internals": \x[tool-assisted-speedrun], how the devkit looks like, how games were developed for it, hardware leaks, etc.

Luckily Ciro's mind is not interested enough by that \x[art][useless shit] for Ciro to seriously study it himself. But that's what \x[youtube] is for, right? Why do useless stuff when other more useless people can do it for you?

OMG, both of those just \x[fucking] work on \x[ubuntu-20-04] with README instructions, it is unbelievable, those people don't have lives. And it builds the ROM \x[reproducible-builds][byte by byte equal from source]!

    * hide HUD!
  * no level selection yet, but a matter of time?

  They also ported to browser with Emscripten: https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/wiki/Compiling-for-the-web

Tested with the USA ROM at \x[sha1sum] 9bef1128717f958171a4afac3ed78ee2bb4e86ce (you need a ROM to extract assets, which the project automates), which is also documented in the project itself: https://github.com/sm64-port/sm64-port/blob/6b47859f757a40096fedd6237f2bc3573d0bc2a4/sm64.us.sha1[]. Disclaimer: \x[ciro-santilli] owns a copy of \x[super-mario-64].

The only dependency missing from Ubuntu packages is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIX[IRIX] \x[qemu] https://cirosantilli.com/linux-kernel-module-cheat/#user-mode-simulation[user mode] which they need for their tooling. The project also has a QEMU fork for that, and provide a working deb.

From this project it was also noticed that certain ROM releases were not compiled with optimizations enabled, presumably because as a release title the compiler had optimization bugs! https://www.resetera.com/threads/so-apparently-the-ntsc-build-of-mario-64-didnt-use-any-compiler-optimizations.166277/ But now they do have a working compiler, and by turning that switch FPS increases in certain levels!!!

It is good to know that this game will "never die".

It is a shame, but this game just doesn't feel good. The controls are just not as snappy as \x[mario-kart-64], the levels are too wide which limits player interaction, and the weapons feel clumsy weak and unexciting. These are all aspects that the closed source \x[smashkarts-io] gets pretty well.

Quite good. Physics not as good as original Mario Kart, notably missing jump gliding, and generally not as sharp! But it is OK.

Some of the weapons are too useless that you are just better firing them straight away at wall immediately to get something better, they could have a little better balancing there.

This game (1 or 2, can't remember) made an impression on \x[ciro-santilli] for some reason.

Only many many years after playing it, after Ciro \x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china][started getting more interested], did he learn that it was actually an adaptation of the \x[chinese] mega-classic \x[water-margin].

The game puts great emphasis on the concept of the \x[108-stars-of-destiny]: making 108 allies, the main \x[collectible-video-game-design] of the game, allows you to make a more powerful alliance, and unlock better endings. Actually, now that Ciro thinks about it, these were already likely meant as a "collectible" element by the author of the original book, as is strongly suggested by all the little illustrations of each character present on the \x[wikipedia] page. And so are the \x[catholic] \x[saint]{p}.

Ciro would notably feel many years later, that as he \x[ciro-santilli-s-e-soulmates][met random people online] who were interested in \x[ourbigbook-com][improving eduction], as if he were actually

Reviews mostly old RPG and strategy games. And \x[hentai] games when it is possible to hide the porn from \x[youtube]. He also sponsors Hentai and uploads it on his website: https://www.ssethtzeentach.com/nsfw

\x[ciro-santilli] really likes his sense of humor, always going into "\x[politically-incorrect]" areas, and often making fun of both dictatorships and the USA. He actually knows a bit about politics. Due to the nature of his humour, many of his earlier videos have been taken down from YouTube apparently, https://www.ssethtzeentach.com/videos mentions:
\Q[Ever since going full time, I'm usually very clean and stay out of trouble, but in the past a fair number of my videos were taken down.]

The videos are also incredibly packed full of well selected edited-in "\x[meme]{p} jokes". He particularly likes very short snippets of \x[gay] porn which cannot actually be taken down as porn, even though the obviously are porn excerpts, like the buffed dude blowing a kiss to his tit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw8v5__Ytf4 Heroes of Might and Magic III (2018) is one of the best reviews. Sseth likes to find and make fun of game breaking imbalances, something that Ciro likes due to his \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-creative-personality].

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOJdDvf-tUs The Sseth Streaming Experience (2019), being a live stream, likely shows more realistically how Seth actually talks in real life.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG9g2byXR2c Might and Magic VI (Re)Review is another good video (2021)

Sseth has a certain \x[vaporwave] aesthetic, which Ciro also enjoys.

Conveyor belt 2D top down mining like \x[factorio], but with more emphasis on tower defense/\x[real-time-strategy], \x[pvp] looks a lot like \x[starcraft] or \x[age-of-empires].

As of pre alpha 135, the most annoying thing is that you can't easily start a campaign scenario from fresh, if you lose you have to start from wave 1 but with everything already half built as you left it. This gives you a huge advantage...

It is also annoying that you have to manually rebuild everything that was destroyed afer each attack, unless you have some unit that you can only unlock later on...

https://mindustry-unofficial.fandom.com/wiki/Future_Content#New_Google_Play_Listing suggests \x[freemium] features being considered, but they are mostly minor or plaform specific. There seems to be no server list by default however, making the Steam multiplayer freemium valuable.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5ThSECaAwA suggests \x[code-drop] is used.

It is a bit annoying that you have to unlock the tech tree little by little in campaign, but it does serve as a reasonable introduction to the general order of development. Games with progression state are boring, except when there is \x[permadeath]. But custom play scenarios have everything unlocked immediately, much better.

It is very cool that you can copy chunks of buildings as macros, and save them for later.

The game runs very well it feels like.

The logic blocks are particularly interesting, and allow you to program a block yourself.

Seems to simulate the world in an extremely elaborate way.

Ciro can't help but to think that with a little content work, this game engine could also produce a \x[factorio]-like (conveyor belts mentioned in passing at: https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/vehicle-unloading/10783[]), or a \x[the-sims]-like, or an Stardew-valley-like. E.g. even stuff like house building is already included: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnCYGSlZ1gE

They're also adding more and more allyied NPC management in "faction camps" it seems: https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/edg5y0/a_beginners_guide_to_faction_bases/ thus approaching the game further to \x[dwarf-fortress] or \x[rimworld].

\x[ciro-santilli] played this for 1 day and a half non-stop with \x[cataclysm-dda-save-scum][save scumming] in 2022, then he deleted his saves and uninstalled the game, and started Googling to see how end games can look like, \x[high-flying-bird-vs-gophers][as usual].

The problem is that it is a bit to find edited gameplay with highlights only, the type of people who play those games are just regular nerds right. But there is a lot of gameplay videos, just not edited ones.

Then two days later Ciro re-downloaded it and played more, just no so nonstop, the urge was too strong. Two days later, he deleted the save again after clearing out a middle sized town, and reaching a large town.

Then Ciro learned about debug menu, which is the best way to experience all buildings/weapons/abilities easily without grinding more than necessary. TODO any simple easy way to become invincible there? https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/prompt-for-certain-debug-commands/19209/5
\Q[We do not accept feature requests for the debug menu.]
Lol. Found a "Debug invincibility" and "Debug invisibility" under mutations.

But a few days later he played a bit more for a day non-stop after having learnt some more techniques from YouTube, and then deleted again.

Ciro noticed that the part of this game that he likes the most is the early game. Raiding low populated areas like farms is joy. Once you get a car and stabilize, things become a bit less fun, and it is then just a matter of getting more and more powerful with a lot of routine work, which takes time. Sleeping in tents is quite tempting as well, there's a campfire overmap tile that is great. You can actually take down tents Ciro later learnt... that's awesome.

A major joy of this type of game is the ability to loot shops and homes without any moral implications since the former owners are all dead/zombified.

Another major joy is the incredible value you attach to items you discover, because they are truly life changing.

For example, Ciro was first obsessed with his duffel bag, which could carry huge volumes, and made fixing it a top priority once it got ripped!

Then he was obsessed about the 4x4 car he found, which looks like this:
``
fffffF
fttsfF
fttsfF
fffffF
``
where:
* `f`: frame
* `F`: reinforced frame
* `t`: trunk
* `s`: seat
What a great design! Enough room for a lot of loot, and also the reinforced frame to kill zombies without destroying the car, all while not being overly heavy which spends a lot of fuel, not being too wide which makes maneuvering in cities with broken cars on the road hard! Also the trunks were large enough for large water tanks, which solves your clean water supply forever.

Humvees are also good, but they are wider, have a lot of useless seats, and consume diesel, a lot of diesel, runs out very quickly. But they are even tougher than the 4x4, and have a turret that can fire at zombies.

It should be noted however that larger towns are generally just too much to use a car to clear, you will just waste too much fuel/car damage/real world time. The only way is to go at night it seems.

And then guns. The power of a guns is something to behold. Encounters that would easily be your death become one shot escapes. But of course, ammo is very limited, so you want to use each precious shot wisely! FEMA camps are a good place to get some easy powerful rifles and reasonable amount of ammo. Just drive in front of the entrance, and make the armed guards follow you out, then run them over. Try not to attract the zombie inside though, they are useless civilians without weapons, and just take up your time.

This game is also very good to learn some \x[english-language] if you are not a native, as you have to learn what all those bit and bobs you never needed to say before are.

The default \x[tileset] when running `cataclysm-tiles` is a huge improvement over the text version, but still, could be a bit higher res. Overmap tilesets were only added in 2021 it seems: https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/pxtqsn/new_overmap_tileset_available/

There are other built-in tiles under settings, but all of them are way too resolution for a casual gamer.

https://github.com/I-am-Erk/CDDA-Tilesets has a good tileset pack. To install on \x[ubuntu-21-10], drop the release under:
``
~/.local/share/cataclysm-dda/gfx/
``
and then select `UltCa` from Settings > Tiles in the main menu. It does make things much more immediately understandable. Edit: after some initial plays, Ciro had a second look at the default `-tiles` graphics, and they are not so bad. But still, the higher resolution is better. Edit: looks like they are going to merge it in-tree, which is great! https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/commits/master/gfx/UltimateCataclysm

No default sounds, but has a soundpacks mechanism. Sad for now default, but cool for the configurability:
* https://github.com/damalsk/damalsksoundpack/releases[]. It makes a large noise every time you walk, which is very annoying. Ambient sounds and music are OK though. It should really give a comfy music when in the shelter though.
Installation is similar to tilesets, but you put it under `sounds/` instead of `gfx/`. Restart required to select the soundpack option, and another restart required for the selected option to be used, clunky.

This is the type of thing that prevents wider adoption of this game, it is just too hard to figure out things.

The other major requirement for casual players would be mouse clicking stuff with dropdown menus that show what you can do there (e.g. `E` and `Shift` + `G`), and better menus, everything should be also doable with a mouse in addition to the keyboard shortcuts.

Besides the zombies, it also has some high tech stuff like bionics and aliens mixed in. And mods add other stuff, e.g. https://cddawiki.chezzo.com/cdda_wiki/index.php?title=Magiclysm which is quite cool. The design document/lore spoilers explain that this is the actual cause of te cataclysm: https://cataclysmdda.org/lore-background.html

The cool thing about this type of game is that enemies are really powerful, which is so much more realistic. Even a single zombie has to be given lots of respect, especially since healing is a slow process like real life, and killing one feels like an achievement.

Some other cool points:
* https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/3m92cc/are_worlds_truly_infinite/ the map is truly infinite. Everything is persistent. They must freeze things in some state of course when the player is not around, and hydrate it (using \x[react-js]-like terminology!) when you come back, but they all look very plausibly continuous to how things where. They call the fully simulated world the "reality bubble": https://cddawiki.chezzo.com/cdda_wiki/index.php?title=Reality_bubble That pages says though that not everything hydrates. Shame there are no oceans yet: https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/huvnon/when_are_we_getting_oceans/

  But there are lakes, and lake islands: http://cddawiki.chezzo.com/cdda_wiki/index.php?title=Lake but they are quite rare on the mapgen, outside of fixed scenario starts.

  There could definitely be some more biome variety in the game though, e.g. hills, mountains, deserts, tropical forests, and so on. As it stands in 2021, the game is basically a USA midwest simulator. This is confirmed in the official design document: https://cataclysmdda.org/lore-background.html[].

  Hills: https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/ar9kam/hills_and_mountains/

  This also make the survival scenarios a bit ridiculous. Middle of nowhere means you walk a little bit out of the woods and you reach a huge shopping mall!

Tips for beginners:
* a \x[reddit] list: https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/hsxpco/things_you_wish_you_knew_when_you_started_playing/
* go to town at night, zombies are even blinder than you, it is possible to sneak by massive hoards, fighting one enemy at a time, even when they are well packed together. The only possible reason to go out during the day is to smash zombies with a car without crashing.
* favoriting items makes you not drop them by default with `,`. This is fundamental so you can drop loot while keeping survival stuff on you.
* indestructible and faster than you early game enemies, encounter means certain death: Survivor zombie, Giant cockroach, Giant wasp. Walking on trails is also potentially deadly, which is very annoying... sometimes you only see dealy enemies like wolves when you are on top of them on trails. Not sure what to do about that.
* pick up all items from any surrounding tile: `/`, then on left `I` for inventory, on right `A` for area. You can also examine items with `e` if not everything fits, and sort by category with `s`. That's the most important menu in the game!
* duffel bags are the best thing ever made, carry huge volumes, and you can craft them too!
* smash (`S`) zombie corpses after you kill them, or else they will re-raise after a few hours. They will be wounded and easy to kill however.
* \x[restrict-the-fuck-out-of-cars][just like in real life], cars are the ultimate killing machine. For some reason though, it does not smash zombie corpses. They can also carry infinite crap, after clearing up a town, you can just pick up EVERYTHING without thinking too much, just hit `,`. To bulk move things into/off a car, just hold Enter until the inventory is full. So sort huge piles by category: Shift + V then S:.
  * to get fuel from other cars, you need a rubber hose that can be easily obtained by smashing a refrigerator.
  * you can just siphon directly from one vehicle to another if you stop them close by, no need to go through containers every time!
  * you will learn where are good places to find cars:
    * bridges
    * prisons
    * mine entrance parking lots
    * car refueling/repair stations
  \x[ciro-santilli-s-cycling][Just like in real life], bicycles are pretty good if you can't find a working car, as they don't consume fuel, just stamina. You can even go around hordes if you are crazy enough, and try to look for working cars in towns, but going on the countryside would be wiser. Just make sure you always have enough stamina to cycle out to safety if your electric motor isn't working, which is often the case!

  Electric cars can also be recharged from the sun, which means they will never run out. They are generally not very strong, so not suitable for ramming, and the battery runs out relatively soon. But great to stop out of town.
* head encumbrance does not seem to do anything besides limit how many hats you can wear, so do ware that motorcycle helmet: https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/a5nq6c/head_encumbrance/
* headlamps are a must
* on the overmap `m`, you can fast travel with `Shift + W` twice. Not perfect path finding, but saves a lot of useless clicking!
* on the EVAC shelter computer, contact us is not useless at all! It shows the nearest refugee center, and can show a lot of map because it shows the full road path there
* climb buildings to see further out. You can start by climbing the EVAC shelter via gutter with `>`! But to go down pipes you have to examine it, not `<`, it's weird. Edit: actually, you can "climb down" any ledge, so that's why. But you can still get hurt, so don't do it unless it is really necessary. You will want to carry the telescope, or a binoculars with you at all times most likely, as it is just a huge asset. You just can't climb back up without the water pipe. Radio tower and silos are other good buildings to climb, and radio towers often contain telescopes which allow you to see very very far, climbing those is a top priority when scouting a new region. Don't jump down, even of 1 floor, as it hurts you. A bit exaggerated, but so be it.
* you can grind fabrication easily to level 1 even without a book: https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/6r2477/best_way_to_grind_fabrication/ This is fundamental to make the all important brazier. And you'll learn that dumping things in the brazier unecessarily burns them out, the uninsuitive "Construct" > "Firewood Source" is a must.
* place brazier immediately outside of the EVAC shelter window, this way you avoid smoke problems, but can still cook from the inside.
* shopping carts are the very best mechanism to carry a lot of loot in town besides a car. And there's a foldable version that can fit into cars, but you have to craft it... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kccBl7cksPY[]. Most important item ever.
* there's a built-in debug menu that allows you to cheat whatever you want: spawn items, change your stats (e.g. 10000 strenght and smash through walls? no problem), learn skills, reveal map, and teleport. You have to bind a key to it before using it from `?`, `,` is a good bind candidate. Now that's real fun, being \x[god].
* auto-smash mode is a must
* you likely should look into spears: https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/7m99jb/why_melee_with_anything_besides_spears/[]. Reach attacks from spears are OP, as you can hit a zombie, run, wait for it to come in range, hit from afar, run, and so on. Then after killing a zombie, you wait until your stamina recovered with `|`. This allows to safely kill anything as fast as you without taking hits. Wooden spear is a good first one, and it is not flimsy and lasts a while, like 30-50 zombies maybe. A pitch fork is another good option if you can find one.

How a typical early day looks like for a newbie: go to down, fight 5 zombies, get some stuff from houses, and run back home because your limbs are too weak and could break. Get home 10AM, and read the hole day and night. Repeat.

A fun play style is: get a car, clear out a small town with a library, bring food and books back to the base, fill the 4 60L tanks with water and bring them on the car as well, and then just read for several days until the food runs out. Repeat. It is not super serious if you don't have a car though, as even "shallow water" pools found in every forest can fill one of them. Exploitative mechanic BTW.

Top feature requests for \x[ciro-santilli]:
* https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/2mni5z/can_i_store_items_in_a_backpack_and_drop_the/[]. As of 0.E-3-1, drop happens automatically on Take off, but then you have to pick up items that go overweight/volume one by one.
* find items in my inventory by quality, or at least all item qualities in a single sortable table, otherwise it is too hard to know which item can do what
* fill all empty containers with something, e.g. water from a large pool into 25 plastic bottles
* view wound details without having to select bandage or antiseptic. `@` "EFFECTS" has a summary, but it is too tiny, that stats window should be fullscreen for sure
* realism requests. Ciro is a big fan of realism in CDDA, the more the better, and if you don't like something, just use the debug menu!
  * \x[shitting]/\x[peeing] system
  * when you wash clothes (currently important because zombie worn clothes that you pickup are generally filthy and reduce morale), make the clothes wet and require drying. There are even already some rotation clothes handers in houses, but just putting on a bench would be enough. And of course, higher temperatures mean faster drying, next to a fire would be ideal. Wearing wet clothes would of course make you cold and demoralized.

Their dominating Q&A communication channels are terrible, as of 2021 everything you google leads to: https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/ which suffers from \x[online-forums-that-lock-threads-after-some-time-are-evil]. They've since made a discourse thankfully however: https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/

Source code overview:
* it is funny how the `lang/` directory with translations is by far the largest of the repo ta 100MB, way larger than `gfx`, it's comical

One of the things it simulates is some level of builing stuff:
* you can build a wooden house: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnCYGSlZ1gE including floor, roof, windows. There are also concrete walls. Of course, building is useless, what you really want is a super mega truck that doubles as a home.
* you can dig water channels from rivers/lakes with a digging tool to bring water to your doorstep. TODO can you dig down deeper than "pit", minecraft style?

* TODO can you generate power e.g. in solar cells or not, and wire it into home appliances? https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/4zm7tf/solar_panels_useless/ from 2016 says no.

  * https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/9j9e16/wired_homes_and_electrical_systemgrid/ from 2018 says no due to fundamental reality bubble limitations, the only way is with power coming from stuff mounted on vehicles...
  The solution would be simple... just mark the edge incoming wire from the reality bubble as a magic source that has a given voltage/max amperage/total power or total wattage available. Would be good enough. Sure, some estimates might be hard, e.g. how much sun is there in a far away location of the map, etc. but just having some average of those values would be good enough. E.g. average temperature of an off bubble tile would also be useful to calculate food rotting time.

  A related obvious application would be refrigerators. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6B0KBJHvZs from 2021 mentions again that you can't have power without vehicles. TODO do the refrigerators in a powered 01 lab protect food?

  The fork https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN is actually trying to add an electric grid...

{title=\x[cataclysm-dark-days-ahead] Review by \x[ssethtzeentach] (2018)}
{description=This game really is right up Seth's alley, glad he tried it out. Perhaps his review was partly what motivated \x[ciro-santilli] to give it a try. But the other part, perhaps even more important, was the joy of trying out crappy \x[open-source-video-game]{p}. Ciro especially likes Seth's observation that you could just go all in Mad Max mode. Since vehicles are so powerful, you can just clean up towns with them and basic weapons, then either get a new vehicle when the old one goes bust, or at least very easily find gas. Another good observation is that crafting in this game is amazing.}

Paradoxically Ciro feels like he's becoming a writer of sorts though, one semi independent section/\x[the-machiavellian-stack-overflow-contributor][answer]/piece of knowledge at a time.

{title2=ALSA}
{wiki}

ALSA can be thought as analogous to  physical wires linking up machines.

Except that instead of machines, you have separate programs. One such typical link is:
* from a MIDI source, e.g. \x[vmpk] or a \x[midi] editor with playback like \x[ardour-software]
* to a synthesizer like \x[fluidsynth] or \x[zynaddsubfx]

The advantage of this setup is that separate programs can collaborate to make complex sounds. 

The disadvantage of this setup is that it makes it very hard to reproduce results, you basically need a \x[docker-software] image with the exact same version of everything. And some script to launch and connect all programs correctly.

Some composition systems like \x[lmms] reduce that problem by having synthesizers as plugins, so that you don't have to setup any connections yourself.

Contains a large database of instruments, and allows you to edit them. This is a fun toy.

Instruments are edited on a \x[gui]. It is a multi-window program, and you open new windows from new windows from new windows, all filled with hundreds of virtual knobs that you drag with your keyboard, and which would be better done from textual software like \x[csound]. It is a thing of beauty.

It does not seem possible to program arbitrary \x[modular-synthesizer] circuits therefore. But if you understand \x[additive-synthesis] and \x[subtractive-synthesis] well, you can make some funky sounds with it.

It is basically a superset of all popular \x[hardware-synthesizer]{p} ever made.

Has its own built-in MIDI keyboard which is nice.

Could be more amazing, but it is OK.

A bit limited by being very "guitar oriented". Shows you guitar strings, and you enter offset to each string. So to enter two adjacent notes you need to use two seprate strings and thing about the offsets. If only it had a more piano based interface.

\x[xml] file format (but with 99% of the action of interest in a \x[domain-specific-language] on the `CsInstruments` and `CsScore` elements) that can be played and the reference implementation. Offers complex effects out-of-box apparently.

Allows you to easily define instruments with seemingly arbitrary mathematical functions, and then use them to play notes at given time intervals.

The instrument functions can be parametrized, and each note played can have different parameters.

The instrument definition actually defines a block diagram graph, much like a hardware synthesizer would.

Csound is so not-bloated that it contains an UI system. And it includes an interactive virtual MIDI keyboard that interacts with parameter knobs: http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/MidiTop.html

But hey, it's fun. And like any other good \x[domain-specific-language], \x[debugging] it is barbaric of course.

Bending, sliding and strumming just feel to good to not have.

\x[ciro-santilli]'s sport of choice circa 2020, see also: \x[ciro-santilli-s-cycling].

= Restrict the fuck out of cars
{parent=cycling}
{tag=cirism}

Only people who need to drive a car should be allowed to drive a car anywhere near a city, e.g. people who work door to door, people who are disabled, etc.

Countryside driving is fine. If going to a city, you just have to drive to a parking outside of the city where you then take the \x[public-transport]. And those who live in cities must leave their cars there too.

Everyone else must walk or cycle from home to \x[public-transport].

Cars just destroy everything, they make everything ugly:
* this was extremely clear to \x[ciro-santilli] as a \x[ciro-santilli-s-cycling][cyclist]. He previously lived in a place with few cars and the countryside was so pleasant. Then he moved to a place with more cars and it was shocking. It's a mixture of pollution, noise, and the fact that roads cut up the countryside that just make things not pleasant at all. Dual lane roads in particular are just a terrible thing. You can hear them from afar, much before you see them.

  You can just see as tiny little villages surrounding the bit city and it's oversized motorways are more or less homogenized into one big city mass, the process is clearly visible as you cycle out of the big city and the villages become nicer and more unique as you go along further out.
* even within cities, cars completely dehumanize the streets. For example, Ciro once lived in a small dead end street, and he would have gladly opened his front window more often to meet the neighbours. But just the noise of cars passing by every so often makes it impractical to work like that.

The \x[zatoichi-effect] applies well to the problem of cyclists:
* they are not really pedestrians, and pedestrian paths are not suitable to them because they are too narrow, of not smooth, or curved. But pedestrians will always have enough political power to have their paths, because they live around the paths
* they are not really motor vehicles, because motor vehicle paths are too wide and too fast for them. But motor vehicles will always have enough political power to have their paths, because people are lazy and stupid, and because as the world stands, individually you just don't have any reasonable choice to go anywhere.
This is the main drama faced by cyclists.

Quora is crap, but in part due to some \x[bad-stack-overflow-policies], it is the best crap we've got for certain (mostly useless) subjects. Until \x[ourbigbook-com] dominates the world.

The worst thing about quora is that you cannot subscribe only to certain subjects on your feed. Quora just keeps pumping \x[shit] you never subscribed to, no matter what. Ciro, for sport, unfollowed every single idiotic subject it was proposing, but it didn't work, sooner or later Quora just keeps pumping more shit back. Mind you, some of that shit is fun. But it's still shit.

Stack Overflow does have an super naive reputation and moderation system and overly restrictive subject matter, which \x[ciro-santilli] wants to improve upon with: \x[ourbigbook-com].

However, it is the best that we have now, and if you \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions][use it like Ciro], you won't get tired:
* monitor only rare tags that you know a lot about, let others answer duplicates on big tags for you
* only answer on bigger tags when you find a better answer than can be found on the page
* accept that sometimes things are bound to go wrong, that reputation is meaningless, and move on

What else would you expect from a naive algorithm system that has 10 million newbies asking stuff?

= The Machiavellian Stack Overflow contributor
{parent=stack-overflow}

* always upvote questions you care about, to increase the probability that they will get answered
* never upvote other people's answers unless you might gain from it somehow, otherwise you are just giving other high reputation users more reputation relative to you
* only mark something to close or as a duplicate if it will bring you some advantage, because closing things creates enemies, especially if the OP has a high profile

  One example advantage is if you have already answered the question (and the duplicate as well in case of duplicates), because this will prevent competitors from adding new better answers to overtake you.
* protect questions you've answered whenever someone with less than 10 reputation answers it with a bad answer, to prevent other good contributors from coming along and beating you
* when you find a duplicate pool answer every question with similar answers.

  Alter each answer slightly to avoid the \x[stack-overflow-no-duplicate-answers-policy][idiotic duplicate answer detector].

  If one of the question closes, it is not too bad, as it continues netting you to upvotes, and prevents new answers from coming in.
* follow on Twitter/RSS someone who comments on the top features of new software releases. E.g. for \x[git], follow \x[github] on \x[twitter], \x[c-plus-plus] on \x[reddit]. Then run back to any question which has a new answer.
* always upvote the question when you answer it:
  * the more upvotes, more likely people are to click it.
  * the OP is more likely to see your answer and feel good and upvote you
* if a niche question only has few answers and you come with a good one, upvote the existing ones by other high profile users.

  This may lead to them upvoting or liking you.

  Even if they don't, other people will still see your answer anyway, and this will lead to people to upvoting you more just to make your great answer surpass the current ones, especially if the accepted one has less upvotes than yours. Being second is often an asset.
* always upvote comments that favor you:
  * "I like this answer!" on your answers
  * "also look at that question" when you have answered that question
* don't invest a lot in edits. They don't give you rep, and they can https://mathoverflow.net/revisions/11557/4[get reverted] and waste your time.

  Why are you trying to help other people's answers to get rep anyways? Just make a separate answer instead! :-)
* if you answer a question by newbie without 15 reputation, find their other questions if any and upvote them, so that the OP can upvote your answer in addition to just accepting
* If you haven't answered a question, link to related questions you've answered on question comments, so more people will come to your answers.

  If you have answered the question, only link to other questions at the bottom of your answer, so that people won't go away before they reach your answer, and so as to strengthen your answer.
* if a question has 50 million answers and you answer it (often due to a new feature), make a comment on the question pointing to your answer
* if you get a downvote, always leave a comment asking why. It is not because you care about their useless opinion, but because other readers might see the comment, feel sorry for you, and upvote.
* ask any questions under a separate anonymous accounts. Because:
  * intelligent people are born knowing, and don't ever ask any questions, so that would hurt your reputation
  * downvoting questions does not take 1 reputation away from the downvoter, and so it greatly opens the door for your opponents to downvote you without any cost.

Hi mods,

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle

  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/533965/why-is-security-through-obscurity-a-bad-idea

  Security by obscurity does not work. If that is all Stack Overflow relies on, and that is what it looks like, then it is guaranteed to be flawed and already been attacked.

  That is one of the reasons that my website will eventually beat Stack Overflow: https://github.com/cirosantilli/write-free-science-books-to-get-famous-website/tree/d77b18d2e7acb3558615797c36195f60dfd26306#pagerank-with-tags
* If you had messaged me and told me "take down or suspend" I would have done it immediately because I understand the meaning of political power.

  That would have been the better course of action for everyone: I get no block, and you get no bad publicity as I shout Kerckhoff's principle on Twitter.

  But maybe it is a good thing that people learn more about that.
* Is there an existing public discussion saying that you cannot advertise vote fraud tools on this website?

  If not, can you please create that meta thread as a reference for future users, and perhaps let the community decide by itself?

  In particular, will you still suspend me if I don't take down the GitHub repo?

  Because if not, does it make any sense to prevent it from being mentioned in Stack Overflow? Any good GitHub repo just gets enough Google pagerank that it won't matter.

  And if yes, nothing prevents me from re-uploading on an anonymous account.

\Q[
I suspended you to get your attention. Your attitude about going to Twitter about it does not bode well with me.

Feel free to have whatever you want in your GitHub repo. Just don't advertise tools to make it easier for people to circumvent the rules. As easy or as hard as it may be to circumvent them, you're handing it to people who may not be capable of doing so. It doesn't help.

Don't make threats to upload on an anonymous account. Accounts created to circumvent previous warnings are not welcomed on the site.

We don't need a meta thread to discuss whether it's ok to post voting fraud links in your profile and we definitely don't need to give it anymore publicity.

I'll unsuspend you, now we've had this discussion.

A meta thread was later created by Yvette, kudos, to which Ciro answered with the correct unpopular answer that will be downvoted to oblivion: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/381577/is-it-ok-to-have-links-on-how-to-create-sock-puppets-and-gain-rep-fraudulently-i/381635#381635

Yvette had also previously \x[stack-overflow-content-deletion][deleted one or two of Ciro's answers for being duplicates], which is a policy Ciro is against: if the questions are not dupes, a single answer might still directly reply to both of them.

Yvette later announced that she was leaving the website: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/399495/leaving-the-site-and-the-network-mid-election-is-not-the-best-but-theres-no[]. This is evil, but Ciro was happy. He does not mean harm to Yvette, but in their limited interaction, Ciro disagreed with her choices.

= Bad Stack Overflow policies
{parent=stack-overflow}
{tag=evil}

= Idiotic Stack Overflow policies
{synonym}

= Closing questions as off-topic
{parent=bad-stack-overflow-policies}

There's no point.

The question remains there, but people lose the ability to help the asker.

Reputation is meaningless regardless, since \x[javascript] gurus will always have 1000x more readers than low level junkies.

The deeper problem: the existence of multiple separate websites instead of just using the tags on a single website.

= Stack Overflow content deletion
{parent=bad-stack-overflow-policies}

Stack overflow allows deleting content/making it visible only to 10k rep users.

\x[ciro-santilli] is strictly against this, and this is an intended core policy of \x[ourbigbook-com].

If you delete people's content randomly, they will be much less likely to write anything.

Getting downvoted to oblivion is one thing, but data loss? Unacceptable.

Only \x[illegal] content must ever be deleted.

= Stack Overflow policy that you cannot harshly criticize the character of a politician
{parent=bad-stack-overflow-policies}

= Stack Overflow link-only answer policy
{parent=bad-stack-overflow-policies}

The link will break, and the answer will lose. Or the person who summarizes inline will get more upvotes because people are lazy to click the link. Also, \x[web-archiving] exists.

This is especially idiotic when it is a link to another post in \x[stack-overflow] itself.

= Stack Overflow no duplicate answers policy
{parent=bad-stack-overflow-policies}

It's great right? You can't link to your other answer alone: \x[stack-overflow-link-only-answer-policy], but you can't copy the other answer either.

And because not all duplicate close votes succeed, see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59649238/how-to-use-the-m5ops-in-gem5-such-m5-exit-and-m5-dump-stats-in-se-mode/63955139#63955139 the result is that someone else will come and answer the same thing in a different wording.

And some answers answer two questions that are not duplicates, e.g. superset/subset questions.

So just do a slight variation wording yourself and get all the reputation.

= Stack Overflow maximum 200 daily reputation limit
{parent=bad-stack-overflow-policies}

Why. Why. Why is there no limit to how much I can help, but there is a limit to how many thanks I can get?

At most, limit it to a single answer to avoid highly publicized events, e.g. an answer being shared on \x[reddit]. But across answers? It makes no sense.

The two ways main ways to overcome this limit are the 15 point answer accept reputation and bounties.

200 reputation per day works out 73k a year BTW.

The only \x[russian] sounding name on GDB and Binutils git log is that of Paul Pluzhnikov: https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-pluzhnikov-61b9676/ and Employed Russian mentions one of his commits at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3718072/gdb-takes-too-long-and-ctrl-c-has-no-effect Ex physicist: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Pluzhnikov

Ciro also really likes the following users, a bit less like Gods, and bit more like friends:
* partly because they were close by on the yearly reputation charts for a long time circa 2020, so it feels like they also focus on \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions][replying to important questions rather than answering new duplicates immediately]:
  * https://stackoverflow.com/users/642706/basil-bourque[]: GCC dev, but started replying lots of \x[java] questions as of 2021 it seems for some reason

Nothing personal, just \x[ciro-santilli], mostly it is that strongly disagrees with the moderation philosophies of these users.

Users who are publicly against the ability to criticize the character of politicians, shown after "I think Trump is disgusting as a person" was removed from Ciro's profile: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/stack-overflow-forbids-criticizing-the-character-of-genocidal-political-leaders-like-xi-jinping[].

https://stackoverflow.com/users/1144035/gordon-linoff

Infinitely many \x[sql] answers.

As mentioned at \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions], he just answers every semi-duplicate immediatly as it is asked, and is therefore able to overcome the \x[stack-overflow-maximum-200-daily-reputation-limit] by far. E.g. in 2018, Gordon https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/year/stackoverflow/2018-01-01?sort=reputationchange[reached 135k] (https://web.archive.org/web/20191013090451/https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/year/stackoverflow/2018-01-01?sort=reputationchange[archive]), thus almost double the 73k yearly limit due to the 200 daily limit, all of that with accepts.

This is in contrast to \x[ciro-santilli]'s contribution style which is to only answer questions as he needs the subject, or generally important questions that aroused his interest.

2014 \x[blog]{c} post describing his activity: http://blog.data-miners.com/2014/08/an-achievement-on-stack-overflow.html[], key quote:
\Q[For a few months, I sporadically answered questions. Then, in the first week of May, my Mom's younger brother passed away. That meant lots of time hanging around family, planning the funeral, and the like. Answering questions on Stack Overflow turned out to be a good way to get away from things. So, I became more intent.]
so that suggests his contributions also take a \x[meditative] value.

http://www.data-miners.com/linoff.htm mentions he's an SQL consultant that consulted for several big companies.

\x[linkedin] profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordonlinoff/ says he now works at the \x[new-york-times].

2021 \x[reddit] thread about him: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/puok1h/a_single_person_answered_76k_questions_about_sql/ mentions that by then he had:

{source=https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4864/ron-maimon}

He does subscribe to some theories which \x[ciro-santilli] considers conspiracy theories, e.g. his ideas about the \x[boston-marathon-bombing] that got him banned from \x[quora] (a ban which \x[social-media-as-a-public-utility][Ciro strongly opposes due to freedom of speech concerns!]), but the \x[physics] might be sound, \x[ciro-santilli] does not know enough physics to judge, but it often feels that what he says makes sense.

Ron seems to share a few philosophies which Ciro greatly agrees with as part of \x[cirism], which together with his knowledge of \x[physics], make Ciro greatly respect Ron. Such philosophies include:
* \x[education] views, notably emphasising \x[autodidacticism]
  * https://www.quora.com/Why-should-high-school-students-learn-physics/answer/Ron-Maimon[], highlighted at https://gmachine1729.livejournal.com/161418.html[]: "Why should high school students learn physics?" Answer:
    \Q[But they should learn it, preferably on their own, because the school doesn't know how to teach physics. Physics is extremely interesting, even the elementary kind. It takes the mathematics you learn in high school and uses it to describe certain natural phenomenon completely, beyond what was imagined possible in the wildest dreams of people like Pythagoras or Archimedes. If you have a computer, Newton's laws plus a tiny code can produce the motion of the planets around the sun, the motion of a free-twirling baton, the motion of colliding billiards, it's very simple.]
    Yes, please, give it to me baby:
    * \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation]
    * \x[computational-physics]
* enthusiasm for \x[molecular-biology-technologies], seen e.g. at: https://www.quora.com/Why-are-an-abundance-of-physicists-moving-to-theoretical-biology/answer/Ron-Maimon on \x[quora]:
  \Q[\[biology\] is also clearly going to be the major technology of the 21st century, you should have a sugar outlet next to the electrical outlet, and plug in artificial biological technology made out of artificial cells. To plan these requires a complete method of describing biological cells, a precise model of all the processes, so that you can make artificial ones, and it produces a type of precise control on single-molecule chemistry that makes chemists drool.]
  Ciro is actually specifically curious about \x[whole-cell-simulation] which he makes reference to.
* \x[effortless-effort] and the to explain everything he knows online. These can be seen at https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-control-your-urge-to-access-the-internet-so-you-can-complete-your-assignments[] "How do you control your urge to access the \x[internet] so you can complete your assignments?":
  \Q[I don't. I consider the internet the first priority, as it will be viewed by thousands of people, and will have a real impact, while other assignments are lower priority, as they will only have an impact locally.]
* his cheapness as in \x[ciro-santilli-s-cheapness] as mentioned at https://youtu.be/ObXbKbpkSjQ?t=2454 from \x[video-ron-maimon-interview-with-jeff-meverson-2014]:
  \Q[Interviewer: there's a question on \x[quora] where you say thta you took a vow of poverty when you were very young.

  Ron: I was ten, I mean, most people would give it up, but I mean I figured I didn't have any need to give it up, so I just kept with it, I mean, I was never was really offered that much more. When we started the startup, I think I was offered 50k, but I said "no, I'll keep it 40k, I took a vow", and then they gave me 40k. And that of sort of set an example, the CEO also took 40k. It was a very good thing because we had very little money, we were a startup, and we were going by seed money.]

He has either been blocked from or quit every single website he participates in due to his highly combative nature:
* https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/users/4864/ron-maimon from \x[physics-stack-exchange]:
  * https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/976/physics-ses-inability-to-deal-with-users-who-are-highly-persistent-have-kook-b a user mentions:
  \Q[The thing about Ron Maimon is he definitely comes here to talk about physics. I personally can't get into discussions with him for two reasons: first, he's so single-minded in his own point of view that you can't really communicate with him back and forth; secondly, the structure of this forum is simply not conducive to extended discussions. But he sometimes posts things that are so coherently argued and with such intricate detail that even if I can't understand them myself, I just can't believe he's simply pulling this stuff out of his ass.]
  * https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1376/what-violation-caused-this-suspension[] a user mentions:
  \Q[The thing that makes me pretty angry about Ron's behaviour is that he does not distinguish between common consensus belief and his own private research - this makes evaluating his claims hard for a third party not familiar with physics.]
* https://www.quora.com/profile/Ron-Maimon[], he was very active on \x[quora], until he was blocked for his views on the \x[boston-marathon-bombing] as mentioned at \x[video-ron-maimon-interview-with-jeff-meverson-2014]
Ron explicitly defends this combative approach at https://youtu.be/ObXbKbpkSjQ?t=944 from \x[video-ron-maimon-interview-with-jeff-meverson-2014]:
\Q[In order to have this process work \[finding of truth\] it is extremely important that the tone is hostile, that it is like a court of law, where you have an adversarial relationship with your opponent. Because if you have a friendly relationship with your opponent, then political consensus is preserved.]
And notably, relevant to https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/stack-overflow-mods-refuse-to-clarify-if-anti-ccp-imagery-is-allowed-or-not-2021
\Q[Unfortunately, when you're in a minority, the only way to correct the consensus view is to just shout it, and repeat it, until people go and look and check for themselves. The reason is that it creates an adversarial atmosphere where the people have to pick sides, and they don't like to pick sides, they would rather have everyone be happy. So when you have to pick sides, what do you do? You either butt out, you just leave it alone, you run away. Or you sit and review the evidence until you know which side to pick.]
and he than also mentions that \x[wolfgang-pauli] was a major proponent of this in \x[physics], and so was \x[galileo].

https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/7104585#7104585 mentions that he was at \x[cornell-university] and did \x[all-but-dissertation], but he mentions that he was still \x[self-taught]:
\Q[
Eugene Seidel: On your personal info page you write that you are not a physics Ph.D. but does that mean you were a \x[physics] \x[undergrad] in college then went to grad school and finished \x[all-but-dissertation][ABD]... or are you entirely self taught?

Ron Maimon: \x[all-but-dissertation][ABD]. I am self- taught though, I only went to school for accreditation. I had a thesis worth of work at the time I left grad-school,

Eugene Seidel: ok thanks

Ron Maimon: I was just kind of sickened by \x[academic] stuff that was going on--- large extra dimensions were popular then.

Eric Walker: Anyway, thanks Ron -- I'll get back to you with more questions soon, I'm sure.

Ron Maimon: Also I was at Cornell, my advisor left for Cincinnatti, and I was not in very good standing there (I was kind of a jerk, as I still am). Some friends wanted to start a biotech company called "Gene Network Sciences", and I joined them.

{tag=essays-by-ciro-santilli}
{wiki}

It boggles \x[ciro-santilli]'s mind that people use \x[mailing-list] to collaborate on projects!

The only explanation is that the dinosaurs who created the projects are unable to adapt to new superior technologies.

Yes, Ciro is talking to you, big fundamental projects from last century: \x[linux-kernel], \x[gnu-compiler-collection] (https://gcc.gnu.org/lists.html[]), \x[binutils] (https://sourceware.org/binutils/[]), etc.

Some of you are already using Bugzilla for the bugs, so kudos. But if you've seen their benefit, why you still use the mailing list for patches?

Advantages of mailing lists:
* threaded replies, which almost no issue tracker has. \x[github] feature request: https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/837

Disadvantages: everything else:
* cannot subscribed to a single thread. Which forces you to create an email filter for each one of them you subscribe to.
* no metadata, notably the notion of closing / merging, but also upvotes

  You have to read thirty messages before you can know if the bug was solved or not.
* it is insanely hard to reply to messages from before you were subscribed: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/23197/reply-to-mailman-archived-message/115088#115088

  This forces everyone to subscribe to all lists, and then set up email filters to not be flooded with emails.
* hard to apply patches locally to test them out: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5062389/how-to-use-git-am-to-apply-patches-from-email-messages/49082916#49082916

  Unless they use Patchwork, which adds one more website on top of the mess.

  And then \x[gmail] corrupts your patches, and you are forced to use `git send-email`, which does not work on some network configurations: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28038662/how-to-solve-unable-to-initialize-smtp-properly-when-using-using-git-send-ema or setup ThunderBird.
* often have to subscribe to post at all, thus cluttering your inbox further
* you can edit posts to make them clearer.

  Yes, people could vandalize their answers when they get mad, and threads might stop making sense after edits. But this can be solved with an undeletable post history like Stack Overflow has (but not any other tracker does).

  Or archive.org :-)

  In any case, what do you think will happen more often and have greater impact:
  * people vandalize their posts
  * people fix their silly typos and improve content
* searchable by author, keyword, etc. without Google. Yes, mailing list trackers could have decent implementations to overcome that. But no, GNU Mailman which everyone uses does not have it. Google barely indexes it.

  And I don't think Google properly indexes many of the mailing list archives for some reason: I never get hits for my own posts a week later, while I often do on GitHub issues.
* people have to learn about top posting vs inline posting, and this requires infinite education of new users
* Line comments in code reviews like GitHub and GitLab.

  On mailing lists: either put a comment in the middle of a huge patch and let other people find it, or (more likely) copy paste the part of the patch that you are talking about.
* most mail web UIs suck.

  OK, this is not an unsolvable or intrinsic problem, but still a problem.

  E.g.: `ezmlm` it is not possible to see the entire content in a single page: <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2015-07/threads.html>

  Unless you like reading threads backwards and with 4 levels of `>` quotations.

  The alternative: do like LLVM and send attachments. Yes, I we all love opening up attachments on our browsers.

  The real solution: everyone can create branches and pull requests. Also has the benefit of running \x[ci] on the pull requests.

Not sure:
* you can have infinitely many trackers to replicate data in case apocalypse happens in some part of the world.

  Although I'm not sure this is an advantage, as you don't know anymore which one is the canonical trackers an advantage, as you don't know anymore which one is the canonical tracker.

  And all web interfaces already have an API to export messages, and someone has already scripted it to import from any web UI to any web UI for you.

  And GitHub offers infinite precise history transparently on its API.

{parent=mediawiki}

https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Markup_spec

= How to reference a book in Wikipedia markup?
{parent=mediawiki-markup}

Their reference markup is incredibly overengineered, convoluted, and underdocumented, it is unbelivable!

Use the reference:
``
This is a fact.{{sfn|Schweber|1994|p=487}}
``

Define the reference:
``
===Sources===
{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}
*{{Cite book|author-link=Silvan S. Schweber |title=QED and the Men Who Made It: Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga|last=Schweber|first=Silvan S.|location=Princeton|publisher=University Press|year=1994 |isbn=978-0-691-03327-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/qedmenwhomadeitd0000schw/page/492 |url-access=registration}}
{{refend}}
``

`sfn` is magic and matches the the author last name and date from the `Cite`, it is documented at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Sfn

Unforutunately, if there are multiple duplicate `Cite`s inline in the article, it will complain that there are multiple definitions, and you have to first factor out the article by replacing all those existing `Cite` with `sfn`, and keeping just one `Cite` at the bottom. What a pain...

You can also link to a specific page of the book, e.g. if it is a book is on \x[internet-archive-open-library] with:
``
{{sfn|Murray|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/supermenstory00murr/page/86 86]}}
``

For multiple pages should use `pp=` instead of `p=`. Does not seem to make much difference on the rendered output besides showing `p.` vs `pp.`, but so be it:
``
{{sfn|Murray|1997|pp=[https://archive.org/details/supermenstory00murr/page/86 86-87]}}
``

{c}
{parent=website}
{wiki}

\x[ciro-santilli] publishes videos of this not-so-common visual programming experiments on his YouTube channel occasionally: https://www.youtube.com/c/CiroSantilli[]. Ciro should however not be lazy and also upload each video produced to \x[wikimedia-commons], since YouTube does not offer a download option even for videos marked with a \x[creative-commons-license]: https://www.quora.com/Can-I-download-Creative-Commons-licensed-YouTube-videos-to-edit-them-and-use-them/answer/Tarmo-Toikkanen[]!

This is also where Ciro's downtime converged to in his early 30's, since he long lost patience for stupid \x[video-game]{p} and \x[television-series].

Ciro developed one interesting technique: while scrolling through YouTube's useless recommendations, when he understands what a channel is about, he either immediately:
* subscribes if it is amazing and then "Don't recommend channel"
* otherwise just "Don't recommend channel" immediately
This helps to keep this feed clean of boring stuff he already knows about. There is unfortunately an \i[infinite] amount of useless videos out there however on the topics of:
* sports
* music, mostly idiotic top of the charts
* news and political commentary
* food
* programming tutorials. \x[meh]{c}, got \x[stack-overflow].
* stuff that is \x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world][not in English], and notably languages that Ciro does not even speak!
* motorcycles
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR[ASMR]
* cute animals
* gaming and movie commentary. Ciro is interested only in a very specific number of \x[video-game]{p}
* nature life, e.g. hiking, cycling, or living in isolation, this Ciro enjoys
* science for kids (\x[popular-science])
and no matter how much you say you don't want to hear about them, YouTube juts keeps on sending more.

Things Ciro hates about YouTube:
* you can't follow or ignore a subject, only indirectly tell the algorithm about that. Once you click a popular cat video, you will be forced to watch cat videos for all eternity.
