= Art
{wiki}

Stuff that is beautiful but useless because it does not make food or houses cheaper.

Or from \x[ciro-santilli-s-best-random-thoughts]:
\Q[Without technology, one cannot survive. Without art, one cannot live.]

But that sure enough has a \x[jesus] semi-precursor, and likely many others: \x[man-shall-not-live-by-bread-alone].

There is some art however that lives in the fine intersection between beauty and usefulness:
* \x[mathematics]
* \x[physics]
* \x[computer]

Maybe those are genial. Maybe not. Nostalgia is just too strong to discern. Ciro still goes back to them for rest.

= Children cartoons Ciro Santilli liked to watch
{parent=art-young-ciro-santilli-consumed}

These did not stand the test of time however.

When Ciro was ten years old, he was addicted to 2 cartoons: \x[pokemon] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z[Dragon Ball Z]!

Pokemon had just launched in Brazil in 1999, 2 years after the Japanese launch: https://br.historyplay.tv/hoje-na-historia/comeca-exibicao-original-do-anime-pokemon (http://web.archive.org/web/20191221091947/https://br.historyplay.tv/hoje-na-historia/comeca-exibicao-original-do-anime-pokemon[archive]) And dragon Ball, was first aired in 1989 in Japan! My God, those translations took forever back then!

And \i[everyone] was playing Pokemon on their https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color[Game Boy Color]. Ciro was \x[ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology][already cheap] however, and didn't buy the console despite wanting it, and just played it through his friends handhelds. But maybe this is a good thing. Playing alone sucks.

Watching Dragon Ball Z now feels like watching paint dry, everything takes forever! Apparently padding to sync with the manga: https://www.quora.com/Why-does-DBZ-drag-on-for-so-long The original https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball[Dragon Ball] was likely strictly better, as it was much more fun and took itself less seriously. Also in DBZ https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep[power level inflation] is taken to ridiculous levels. This is why https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Punch_Man[One-Punch Man] is good. Out of all evil characters, https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Frieza[Frieza] is one that made a big impression on Ciro, his graphical design is so good.

= Games young Ciro Santilli played
{parent=art-young-ciro-santilli-consumed}

Mostly \x[video-game]{p} of course.

First when he was really young, about 5, Ciro played a lot of NES, but he doesn't remember things from that era very well. Contra, Ninja Turtles, Battle Tanks, Duck Hunt, and some modern "real world jet" top to bottom rail shooter (TODO identify) are definitely some of the games he clearly remembers playing, see also: \x[image-five-year-old-ciro-santilli-playing-nes-on-a-joystick].

As an honorable mention, Ciro remembers his teenage/young adult neighbours playing some \x[dos] games on their computer. Those games felt so incredibly advanced, including the required setup to play them. It felt like some kind of black magic! But Ciro didn't really play them however.

Ciro then skipped the \x[snes] and handhelds, which he played only through friends because he \x[ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology][was cheap] (but also because Brazil is a poor country remember, and imports are pretty expensive). He clearly remembers playing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World[Super Mario World] for the SNES and \x[children-cartoons-ciro-santilli-liked-to-watch][Pokemon on friends' Gameboys] of course.

Ciro then went straight to 5th generation with the \x[nintendo-64]{child} in 1994 which his parents bought for him during a trip to the \x[united-states]. Once again, because he was cheap, the only game he bought was \x[super-mario-64], which likely came with the console? He played that game to death.

Then came https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time[Ocarina of Time], which blew everyone's minds, and Ciro would go to Blockbuster to rent it for the weekend, and again play to death with his friends. You had to arrive early at Blockbuster to rent it, otherwise other people would rent all copies!!!

The only time Ciro got robbed as of 2020 was when an older teenager stopped his bicycle in front of Ciro and took his rented Golden Eye 64 copy away from his hand, and run off. Poor drug addict.

Ciro always felt that the PS1 had a much uglier aesthetics than the N64, and didn't like the console. Playing a bit of \x[final-fantasy-vi]{child} on his memory did stick deeply to his mind however. Ciro later played all good PS1 RPGs on emulation during \x[university-of-sao-paulo] during amazing solitary nights.

And on the PC, Ciro was particularly touched by \x[age-of-empires-ii] and \x[diablo-ii].

As a young teenager Ciro would also play \x[counter-strike] with his friends at LAN houses. Playing that game would make Ciro extremely anxious, his hands got all cold, and it was a lot of fun.

After this Ciro grew up and notice that the only fun game is that of becoming \x[ciro-santilli-s-selfish-desires][become rich and famous] in the real world.

This explains however Ciro's \x[tool-assisted-speedrun] interests.

Outside of video games, Ciro got midly addicted to \x[magic-the-gathering] in his early teens.

= Pokemon
{c}
{parent=games-young-ciro-santilli-played}
{wiki=Pokémon}

One of the main \x[children-cartoons-ciro-santilli-liked-to-watch].

Ciro could not understand why Nintendo won't make a proper 3D https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game[MMORPG] Pokemon with actually 3D Pokemon roaming the land, which is obviously what everyone wants. There are even fan games getting there!
* https://pokemon-mmo-3d.com Interesting concept here, where when you deploy a Pokemon, you start controlling the Pokemon rather than the main character
* https://www.quora.com/Why-won-t-Nintendo-make-an-open-world-3D-Pokémon-RPG/answer/Ciro-Santilli
until this explaiend it beautifully \x[video-the-downfall-of-mainline-pokemon-games-by-gonz-media-2020]:
* Pokemon became an \x[industrialized] yearly game spitting machine, and therefore any new feature is just extra risk
* Pokemon was kept mostly as a handheld exclusive to sell handlhelds, with a few early exceptions such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Snap[Pokemon Snap]

{parent=art-young-ciro-santilli-consumed}

Lower teens, before discovering more hardcore stuff that is more genial and adult-venerable:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Jam[Pearl Jam]

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers[Red Hot Chili Peppers]

= Restrict the fuck out of cars
{parent=cycling}
{tag=cirism}

Only people who need to drive a car should be allowed to drive a car anywhere near a city, e.g. people who work door to door, people who are disabled, etc.

Countryside driving is fine. If going to a city, you just have to drive to a parking outside of the city where you then take the \x[public-transport]. And those who live in cities must leave their cars there too.

Everyone else must walk or cycle from home to \x[public-transport].

Cars just destroy everything, they make everything ugly:
* this was extremely clear to \x[ciro-santilli] as a \x[ciro-santilli-s-cycling][cyclist]. He previously lived in a place with few cars and the countryside was so pleasant. Then he moved to a place with more cars and it was shocking. It's a mixture of pollution, noise, and the fact that roads cut up the countryside that just make things not pleasant at all. Dual lane roads in particular are just a terrible thing. You can hear them from afar, much before you see them.

  You can just see as tiny little villages surrounding the bit city and it's oversized motorways are more or less homogenized into one big city mass, the process is clearly visible as you cycle out of the big city and the villages become nicer and more unique as you go along further out.
* even within cities, cars completely dehumanize the streets. For example, Ciro once lived in a small dead end street, and he would have gladly opened his front window more often to meet the neighbours. But just the noise of cars passing by every so often makes it impractical to work like that.

The \x[zatoichi-effect] applies well to the problem of cyclists:
* they are not really pedestrians, and pedestrian paths are not suitable to them because they are too narrow, of not smooth, or curved. But pedestrians will always have enough political power to have their paths, because they live around the paths
* they are not really motor vehicles, because motor vehicle paths are too wide and too fast for them. But motor vehicles will always have enough political power to have their paths, because people are lazy and stupid, and because as the world stands, individually you just don't have any reasonable choice to go anywhere.
This is the main drama faced by cyclists.

About 50k subscribers on 2021, which feels way too little for the video quality and quantity.

\x[ciro-santilli] believes that this channel will go very far, certaily achieving 1M subscribers in they keep it for one or twomore years.

They are \x[utah]-based, and they do many many amazing weekend trips. They mostly drive from home to some trailhead, and then climb up and down it the entire day.

No technical \x[rock-climbing], only \x[bouldering], but they still manage to reach many amazing places, and there is a level of danger in many of their ascents.

They also often \x[ski] down the mountains when there is \x[snow].

The cool thing about this channel is that as the name suggests, they are not professionals, and what they do can be done by anyone without working full time on it, as long as you have adequate preparation.

The problem is that they don't manage to go critical because there's to way for students to create content, everything is manually curated.

You can't even comment on the textbooks. Or at least \x[ciro-santilli] hasn't found a way to do so.

This massive lost opportunity is even shown graphically at: https://cnx.org/about (https://web.archive.org/web/20201127013553/https://cnx.org/about[archive]) where there is a clear separation between:
* "authors", who can create content

Quora is crap, but in part due to some \x[bad-stack-overflow-policies], it is the best crap we've got for certain (mostly useless) subjects. Until \x[ourbigbook-com] dominates the world.

The worst thing about quora is that you cannot subscribe only to certain subjects on your feed. Quora just keeps pumping \x[shit] you never subscribed to, no matter what. Ciro, for sport, unfollowed every single idiotic subject it was proposing, but it didn't work, sooner or later Quora just keeps pumping more shit back. Mind you, some of that shit is fun. But it's still shit. Though on second thought, \x[youtube] also randomly decides to reset Ciro's humongous "don't recomend this shitty channel" choices from time to time, which is not much different...

= Mailing list
{parent=website}
{tag=essays-by-ciro-santilli}
{wiki}

It boggles \x[ciro-santilli]'s mind that people use \x[mailing-list] to collaborate on projects!

The only explanation is that the dinosaurs who created the projects are unable to adapt to new superior technologies.

Yes, Ciro is talking to you, big fundamental projects from last century: \x[linux-kernel], \x[gnu-compiler-collection] (https://gcc.gnu.org/lists.html[]), \x[binutils] (https://sourceware.org/binutils/[]), etc.

Some of you are already using Bugzilla for the bugs, so kudos. But if you've seen their benefit, why you still use the mailing list for patches?

Advantages of mailing lists:
* threaded replies, which almost no issue tracker has. \x[github] feature request: https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/837

Disadvantages: everything else:
* cannot subscribed to a single thread. Which forces you to create an email filter for each one of them you subscribe to.
* no metadata, notably the notion of closing / merging, but also upvotes

  You have to read thirty messages before you can know if the bug was solved or not.
* it is insanely hard to reply to messages from before you were subscribed: https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/23197/reply-to-mailman-archived-message/115088#115088

  This forces everyone to subscribe to all lists, and then set up email filters to not be flooded with emails.
* hard to apply patches locally to test them out: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5062389/how-to-use-git-am-to-apply-patches-from-email-messages/49082916#49082916

  Unless they use Patchwork, which adds one more website on top of the mess.

  And then \x[gmail] corrupts your patches, and you are forced to use `git send-email`, which does not work on some network configurations: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28038662/how-to-solve-unable-to-initialize-smtp-properly-when-using-using-git-send-ema or setup ThunderBird.
* often have to subscribe to post at all, thus cluttering your inbox further
* you can edit posts to make them clearer.

  Yes, people could vandalize their answers when they get mad, and threads might stop making sense after edits. But this can be solved with an undeletable post history like Stack Overflow has (but not any other tracker does).

  Or archive.org :-)

  In any case, what do you think will happen more often and have greater impact:
  * people vandalize their posts
  * people fix their silly typos and improve content
* searchable by author, keyword, etc. without Google. Yes, mailing list trackers could have decent implementations to overcome that. But no, GNU Mailman which everyone uses does not have it. Google barely indexes it.

  And I don't think Google properly indexes many of the mailing list archives for some reason: I never get hits for my own posts a week later, while I often do on GitHub issues.
* people have to learn about top posting vs inline posting, and this requires infinite education of new users
* Line comments in code reviews like GitHub and GitLab.

  On mailing lists: either put a comment in the middle of a huge patch and let other people find it, or (more likely) copy paste the part of the patch that you are talking about.
* most mail web UIs suck.

  OK, this is not an unsolvable or intrinsic problem, but still a problem.

  E.g.: `ezmlm` it is not possible to see the entire content in a single page: <https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2015-07/threads.html>

  Unless you like reading threads backwards and with 4 levels of `>` quotations.

  The alternative: do like LLVM and send attachments. Yes, I we all love opening up attachments on our browsers.

  The real solution: everyone can create branches and pull requests. Also has the benefit of running \x[ci] on the pull requests.

Not sure:
* you can have infinitely many trackers to replicate data in case apocalypse happens in some part of the world.

  Although I'm not sure this is an advantage, as you don't know anymore which one is the canonical trackers an advantage, as you don't know anymore which one is the canonical tracker.

  And all web interfaces already have an API to export messages, and someone has already scripted it to import from any web UI to any web UI for you.

  And GitHub offers infinite precise history transparently on its API.

`sfn` is magic and matches the the author last name and date from the `Cite`, it is documented at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Sfn

Unforutunately, if there are multiple duplicate `Cite`s inline in the article, it will complain that there are multiple definitions, and you have to first factor out the article by replacing all those existing `Cite` with `sfn`, and keeping just one `Cite` at the bottom. What a pain...

You can also link to a specific page of the book, e.g. if it is a book is on \x[internet-archive-open-library] with:
``
{{sfn|Murray|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/supermenstory00murr/page/86 86]}}
``

For multiple pages should use `pp=` instead of `p=`. Does not seem to make much difference on the rendered output besides showing `p.` vs `pp.`, but so be it:
``
{{sfn|Murray|1997|pp=[https://archive.org/details/supermenstory00murr/page/86 86-87]}}

{parent=website}
{wiki}

\x[ciro-santilli] publishes videos of this not-so-common visual programming experiments on his YouTube channel occasionally: https://www.youtube.com/c/CiroSantilli[]. Ciro should however not be lazy and also upload each video produced to \x[wikimedia-commons], since YouTube does not offer a download option even for videos marked with a \x[creative-commons-license]: https://www.quora.com/Can-I-download-Creative-Commons-licensed-YouTube-videos-to-edit-them-and-use-them/answer/Tarmo-Toikkanen[]!

This is also where Ciro's downtime converged to in his early 30's, since he long lost patience for stupid \x[video-game]{p} and \x[television-series].

Ciro developed one interesting technique: while scrolling through YouTube's useless recommendations, when he understands what a channel is about, he either immediately:
* subscribes if it is amazing and then "Don't recommend channel"
* otherwise just "Don't recommend channel" immediately
This helps to keep this feed clean of boring stuff he already knows about. There is unfortunately an \i[infinite] amount of useless videos out there however on the topics of:
* sports
* music, mostly idiotic top of the charts
* news and political commentary
* food
* programming tutorials. \x[meh]{c}, got \x[stack-overflow].
* stuff that is \x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world][not in English], and notably languages that Ciro does not even speak!
* motorcycles
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASMR[ASMR]
* cute animals
* gaming and movie commentary. Ciro is interested only in a very specific number of \x[video-game]{p}
* nature life, e.g. hiking, cycling, or living in isolation, this Ciro enjoys
* science for kids (\x[popular-science])
and no matter how much you say you don't want to hear about them, YouTube juts keeps on sending more.

Things Ciro hates about YouTube:
* you can't follow or ignore a subject, only indirectly tell the algorithm about that. Once you click a popular cat video, you will be forced to watch cat videos for all eternity.
