Quantum mechanics is quite a broad term. Perhaps it is best to start approaching it from the division into:
* \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics]: obviously the simpler one, and where you should start
* \x[relativistic-quantum-mechanics]: more advanced, and arguably "less useful"

Key experiments that could not work without quantum mechanics: \x[quantum-mechanics-experiment]{full}.

Mathematics: there are a few models of increasing precision which could all be called "quantum mechanics":
* \x[schrodinger-equation]
* \x[dirac-equation]
* \x[quantum-electrodynamics]

\x[ciro-santilli] feels that the \x[deep-tech][largest technological revolutions since the 1950's have been quantum related], and will continue to be for a while, from deeper understanding of chemistry and materials to \x[quantum-computing], understanding and controlling quantum systems is where the most interesting frontier of technology lies.

Atoms exist and last for a long time, while in \x[maxwell-s-equations][classical electromagnetic theory punctual] orbiting electrons should emit radiation quickly and fall into the nucleus: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/20003/why-dont-electrons-crash-into-the-nuclei-they-orbit

= Emission spectrum
{parent=quantum-mechanics-experiment}
{wiki}

= Spectral line
{parent=emission-spectrum}
{wiki}

A single line in the \x[emission-spectrum].

So precise, so \x[discrete], which makes no sense in \x[classical-mechanics]!

Has been the leading motivation of the development of \x[quantum-mechanics], all the way from the:
* \x[schrodinger-equation]: major lines predicted, including \x[zeeman-effect], but not finer line splits like \x[fine-structure]
* \x[dirac-equation]: explains \x[fine-structure] 2p spin split due to electron spin/orbit interactions, but not \x[lamb-shift]
* \x[quantum-electrodynamics]: explains \x[lamb-shift]
* \x[hyperfine-structure]: due to electron/nucleus spin interactions, offers a window into \x[nuclear-spin]

= NIST Atomic Spectra Database
{c}
{parent=spectral-line}

\x[nist] database for \x[spectral-line]: https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html

Let's do a sanity check.

Searching for "H" for \x[hydrogen] leads to: https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ASD/lines1.pl?spectra=H&limits_type=0&low_w=&upp_w=&unit=1&submit=Retrieve+Data&de=0&format=0&line_out=0&en_unit=0&output=0&bibrefs=1&page_size=15&show_obs_wl=1&show_calc_wl=1&unc_out=1&order_out=0&max_low_enrg=&show_av=2&max_upp_enrg=&tsb_value=0&min_str=&A_out=0&intens_out=on&max_str=&allowed_out=1&forbid_out=1&min_accur=&min_intens=&conf_out=on&term_out=on&enrg_out=on&J_out=on

From there we can see for example the 1 to 2 lines:
* 1s to 2p: 121.5673644608 nm
* 1s to 2: 121.56701 nm TODO what does that $2$ mean?
* 1s to 2s: 121.5673123130200 TODO what does that mean?

We see that the table is sorted from lower from level first and then by upper level second.

So it is good to see that we are in the same 121nm ballpark as mentioned at \x[hydrogen-spectral-line].

TODO why I can't see 2s to 2p transitions there to get the \x[fine-structure]?

= Hydrogen emission spectrum
{parent=spectral-line}

= Hydrogen spectral line
{synonym}

= Gross hydrogen emission spectrum
{parent=hydrogen-emission-spectrum}

One reasonable and memorable approximation excluding any \x[fine-structure] is:
$$
E_n = -\frac{13.6eV}{n^2}
$$
{title=Hydrogen spectral series mnemonic}
see for example example: \x[hydrogen-1-2-spectral-line].

= Hydrogen 1-2 spectral line
{parent=gross-hydrogen-emission-spectrum}
{title2=121.6 nm}

\x[equation-hydrogen-spectral-series-mnemonic] gives for example from \x[principal-quantum-number] 1 to 2 a difference:
$$
E_n = -13.6eV\left[\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{1^2}\right] = 10.2eV
$$
which with \x[planck-einstein-relation] gives about 121.6 \x[nm] ($2.47 \times 10^15$ \x[hz]), which is a reasonable match with the value of 121.567... from the \x[nist-atomic-spectra-database].

{parent=spectral-line}
{wiki}

Split in energy levels due to interaction between electron up or down \x[spin-physics] and the electron orbitals.

Numerically explained by the \x[dirac-equation] when \x[dirac-equation-solution-for-the-hydrogen-atom][solving it for the hydrogen atom], and it is one of the main triumphs of the theory.

= Fine structure constant
{parent=fine-structure}
{title2=$\alpha$}

= Hyperfine structure
{parent=fine-structure}
{wiki}

Small splits present in all levels due to interaction between the electron spin and the \x[nuclear-spin] if it is present, i.e. the nucleus has an even number of nucleons.

As the name suggests, this energy split is very small, since the influence of the nucleus spin on the electron spin is relatively small compared to other \x[fine-structure].

For example, for the \x[hydrogen-emission-spectrum]:
* \x[hydrogen-1-2-spectral-line]: 10.2eV

TODO confirm: does it need \x[quantum-electrodynamics] or is the \x[dirac-equation] enough?

Notable application: \x[caesium-standard], which is used to define the \x[second] in the \x[international-system-of-units] since 1967.

= Zeeman effect
{c}
{parent=spectral-line}
{wiki}

Split in the \x[spectral-line] when a \x[magnetic-field] is applied.

Non-anomalous: number of splits matches predictions of the \x[schrodinger-equation] about the number of possible states with a given angular momentum. TODO does it make numerical predictions?

\x[anomalous-zeeman-effect][Anomalous]: evidence of \x[spin-physics].

http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~blackman/ast104/zeeman-split.html contains the hello world that everyone should know: 2p splits into 3 energy levels, so you see 3 spectral lines from 1s to 2p rather than just one.

p splits into 3, d into 5, f into 7 and so on, i.e. one for each possible \x[azimuthal-quantum-number].

It also mentions that polarization effects become visible from this: each line is polarized in a different way. TODO more details as in an experiment to observe this.

= History of quantum mechanics
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

The discovery of the \x[photon] was one of the major initiators of quantum mechanics.

Light was very well known to be a wave through \x[diffraction] experiments. So how could it also be a particle???

This was a key development for people to eventually notice that the \x[electron] is also a wave.

This process "started" in 1900 with \x[planck-s-law] which was based on discrete energy packets being exchanged as exposed at \x[on-the-theory-of-the-energy-distribution-law-of-the-normal-spectrum-by-max-planck-1900].

This ideas was reinforced by \x[einstein]'s explanation of the \x[photoelectric-effect] in 1905 in terms of \x[photon].

In the next big development was the \x[bohr-model] in 1913, which supposed non-\x[classical-physics] new quantization rules for the \x[electron] which explained the \x[hydrogen-emission-spectrum]. The quantization rule used made use of the \x[planck-constant], and so served an initial link between the emerging quantized nature of \x[light], and that of the \x[electron].

The final phase started in 1923, when \x[louis-de-broglie] proposed that in analogy to photons, \x[electron]{p} might also be waves, a statement made more precise through the \x[de-broglie-relations].

This event opened the floodgates, and soon \x[matrix-mechanics] was published in \x[quantum-mechanical-re-interpretation-of-kinematic-and-mechanical-relations-by-heisenberg-1925], as the first coherent formulation of \x[quantum-mechanics].

It was followed by the \x[schrodinger-equation] in 1926, which proposed an equivalent \x[partial-differential-equation] formulation to \x[matrix-mechanics], a mathematical formulation that was more familiar to \x[physicist]{p} than the matrix ideas of Heisenberg.

= Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

These are the key mathematical ideas to understand!!

There are actually a few formulations out there. By far the dominant one as of 2020 has been the \x[schrodinger-picture], which contrasts notably with the \x[heisenberg-picture].

Another well known one is the \x[de-broglie-bohm-theory], which is deterministic, but \x[non-local].

= Schrödinger picture
{c}
{parent=mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics}

The state of a quantum system is a vector of unit length in a \x[hilbert-space]. TODO why Hilbert Space.

"Making a measurement" for an \x[observable] means applying a \x[self-adjoint-operator] to the state, and after a measurement is done:
* the state \x[wave-function-collapse][collapses] to an \x[eigenvector] of the self adjoint operator
* the result of the measurement is the \x[eigenvalue] of the self adjoint operator
* the probability of a given result happening when the spectrum is \x[discrete] is proportional to the modulus of the projection on that eigenvector.

  For continuous spectra such as that of the \x[position-operator] in most systems, e.g. \x[schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle], the projection on each individual eigenvalue is zero, i.e. the probability of one absolutely exact position is zero. To get a non-zero result, measurement has to be done on a continuous range of eigenvectors (e.g. for position: "is the particle present between x=0 and x=1?"), and you have to integrate the probability over the projection on a continuous range of eigenvalues.

  In such continuous cases, the probability collapses to an uniform distribution on the range after measurement.

  The continuous position operator case is well illustrated at: \x[video-visualization-of-quantum-physics-quantum-mechanics-by-udiprod-2017]
Those last two rules are also known as the \x[born-rule].

Self adjoint operators are chosen because they have the following key properties:
* their eigenvalues form an orthonormal basis
* they are diagonalizable

See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics

Perhaps the easiest case to understand this for is that of \x[spin-physics], which has only a finite number of eigenvalues. Although it is a shame that fully understanding that requires a \x[special-relativity][relativistic] quantum theory such as the \x[dirac-equation].

The next steps are to look at simple 1D bound states such as \x[particle-in-a-box] and \x[quantum-harmonic-oscillator].

This naturally generalizes to \x[schrodinger-equation-solution-for-the-hydrogen-atom].

The solution to the \x[schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle] is a bit harder since the possible energies do not make up a \x[countable-set].

This formulation was apparently called more precisely \x[dirac-von-neumann-axioms], but it because so dominant we just call it "the" formulation.

\x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-notes-by-david-tong-2007] mentions that:
\Q[if you were to write the wavefunction in quantum field theory, it would be a functional, that is a function of every possible configuration of the field $\phi$.]

= Bra-ket notation
{parent=mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics}
{wiki=Bra–ket_notation}

= Bra-ket
{synonym}

Notation used in \x[quantum-mechanics].

Ket is just a \x[vector-mathematics]. Though generally in the context of \x[quantum-mechanics], this is an infinite dimensional vector in a \x[hilbert-space] like \x[l2].

Bra is just the \x[dual-vector] corresponding to a ket, or in other words \x[projection-mathematics] \x[linear-operator], i.e. a linear function which can act on a given vector and returns a single \x[complex-number]. Also known as... \x[dot-product].

For example:
$$
(\bra{x}) \ket{y}
$$
is basically a fancy way of saying:
$$
x \cdot y
$$
that is: we are taking the projection of $y$ along the $x$ direction. Note that in the ordinary dot product notation however, we don't differentiate as clearly what is a vector and what is an operator, while the bra-ket notation makes it clear.

The projection operator is completely specified by the vector that we are projecting it on. This is why the bracket notation makes sense.

It also has the merit of clearly differentiating vectors from operators. E.g. it is not very clear in $x \cdot y$ that $x$ is an operator and $y$ is a vector, except due to the relative position to the dot. This is especially bad when we start manipulating operators by themselves without vectors.

This notation is widely used in \x[quantum-mechanics] because calculating the \x[probability] of getting a certain outcome for an experiment is calculated by taking the projection of a state on one an \x[eigenvalue] basis vector as explained at: \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics]{full}.

Making the projection operator "look like a thing" (the bra) is nice because we can add and multiply them much like we can for vectors (they also form a \x[vector-space]), e.g.:
$$
\bra{x} + \bra{y}
$$
just means taking the projection along the $x + y$ direction.

\x[ciro-santilli] thinks that this notation is a bit over-engineered. Notably the bra's are just vectors, which we should just write as usual with $\va{v}$... the bra thing makes it look scarier than it needs to be. And then we should just find a different notation for the projection part.

Maybe \x[dirac] chose it because of the appeal of the women's piece of clothing: \x[bra], in an irresistible call from \x[british-humour].

But in any case, alas, we are now stuck with it.

{c}
{parent=non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

The \x[partial-differential-equation] of \x[special-relativity][non-relativistic] \x[quantum-mechanics].

Experiments explained:
* via the \x[schrodinger-equation-solution-for-the-hydrogen-atom] it predicts:
  * \x[spectral-line] basic lines, plus \x[zeeman-effect]
* \x[schrodinger-equation-solution-for-the-helium-atom]: perturbative solutions give good approximations to the energy levels
* \x[double-slit-experiment]: I think we have a closed solution for the max and min probabilities on the measurement wall, and they match experiments

Experiments not explained: those that the \x[dirac-equation] explains like:
* \x[fine-structure]
* \x[spontaneous-emission] coefficients

To get some intuition on the equation on the consequences of the equation, have a look at:
* \x[schrodinger-equation-simulations]
* \x[solutions-of-the-schrodinger-equation]

The easiest to understand case of the equation which you must have in mind initially that of the \x[schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle].

Then, with that in mind, the general form of the \x[schrodinger-equation] is:
$$i\hbar\pdv{\psi(\vv{x}, t)}{t} = \hat{H}[\psi(\vv{x}, t)]$$
{title=Schrodinger equation}
where:
* $\hbar$ is the \x[reduced-planck-constant]
* $\psi$ is the \x[wave-function]
* $t$ is the time
* $\hat{H}$ is a \x[linear-operator] called the \x[hamiltonian]. It takes as input a function $\psi$, and returns another function. This plays a role analogous to the Hamiltonian in \x[classical-mechanics]: determining it determines what the physical system looks like, and how the system evolves in time, because we can just plug it into the equation and solve it. It basically encodes the total energy and forces of the system.

The $\vv{x}$ argument of $\psi$ could be anything, e.g.:
* we could have preferred \x[polar-coordinate]{p} instead of linear ones if the potential were symmetric around a point
* we could have more than one particle, e.g. \x[solutions-of-the-schrodinger-equation-for-two-electrons], which would have e.g. $x_1$ and $x_2$ for different particles. No matter how many particles there are, we have just a single $\psi$, we just add more arguments to it.
* we could have even more generalized coordinates. This is much in the spirit of \x[hamiltonian-mechanics] or \x[generalized-coordinate]{p}
Note however that there is always a single magical $t$ time variable. This is needed in particular because there is a time \x[partial-derivative] in the equation, so there must be a corresponding time variable in the function. This makes the equation explicitly \x[non-relativistic].

The general \x[schrodinger-equation] can be broken up into a trivial time-dependent and a \x[time-independent-schrodinger-equation] by separation of variables. So in practice, all we need to solve is the slightly simpler \x[time-independent-schrodinger-equation], and the full equation comes out as a result.

= Time-independent Schrodinger equation
{parent=schrodinger-equation}
{wiki=Schrödinger_equation#Time-independent_equation}

As shown at https://quantummechanics.ucsd.edu/ph130a/130_notes/node124.html[] from \x[quantum-physics-by-jim-branson-2003], using \x[separation-of-variables] we can break up the general \x[schrodinger-equation] into:
* a time-only part that does not depend on space and does not depend on the potential
* a space-only part that does not depend on time:

  $$\hat{H}[\psi(\vv{x})] = E \psi{\vv{x}}$$
  {title=Time-independent Schrodinger equation}

  Since this is the only non-trivial part, unlike the time part which is trivial, this spacial part is just called "the time-independent Schrodinger equation".

  Note that the $\psi$ here is not the same as the $\psi$ in the \x[equation-schrodinger-equation][time-dependent Schrodinger equation] of course, as that psi is the result of the multiplication of the time and space parts. This is a bit of imprecise terminology, but hey, physics.

The key initial example to have in mind is the \x[time-independent-schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle].

It is interesting to note that the time-independent Schrodinger equation can also be seen exactly as an \x[eigenvalue] equation, since the value of the energy `E` can be any fixed value that can satisfy the \x[boundary-condition]{p} conditions imposed. The only difference from usual \x[matrix] \x[eigenvector]{p} is that we are now dealing with an \x[infinite-dimensional] vector space.

Then, just like in \x[solving-partial-differential-equations-with-the-fourier-series] of the \x[heat-equation], the boundary conditions may make it so that only certain \x[discrete] values of `E` are possible solutions.

Then, the time part o the equation can be solved explicitly in the general case, as it does not depend on the potential $V(x)$, and it is just an exponential.

Therefore, all we need to do to solve the general Schrodinger equation is to solve the time-independent version, and then decompose the initial condition in terms of it like as done in \x[solving-partial-differential-equations-with-the-fourier-series]{full}.

Furthermore:
* we immediately see from the equation that the time-independent solutions are states of deterministic energy because the energy is an \x[eigenvalue] of the Hamiltonian operator
* the probability density of such a state does not change with time because the exponential time part cancels out on the conjugate

The wave equation contains the entire state of a particle.

From \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics] remember that the wave equation is a vector in \x[hilbert-space].

And a single vector can be represented in many different ways in different basis, and two of those ways happen to be the position and the momentum representations.

More importantly, position and momentum are first and foremost operators associated with observables: the \x[position-operator] and the \x[momentum-operator]. And both of their eigenvalue sets form a basis of the \x[hilbert-space] according to the \x[spectral-theorem].

When you represent a wave equation as a function, you have to say what the variable of the function means. And depending on weather you say "it means position" or "it means momentum", the position and momentum operators will be written differently.

This is well shown at: \x[video-visualization-of-quantum-physics-quantum-mechanics-by-udiprod-2017].

Furthermore, the position and momentum representations are equivalent: one is the \x[fourier-transform] of the other: \x[position-and-momentum-space]. Remember that notably we can always take the Fourier transform of a function in \x[l2] due to \x[carleson-s-theorem].

Then the uncertainty principle follows immediately from a general property of the Fourier transform: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fourier_transform&oldid=961707157#Uncertainty_principle

In precise terms, the \x[uncertainty-principle] talks about the \x[standard-deviation] of two measures.

We can visualize the uncertainty principle more intuitively by thinking of a \x[wave-function] that is a \x[real-number][real] \x[flat-top-bump-function] with a flat top in \x[1d]. We can then change the width of the support, but when we do that, the top goes higher to keep probability equal to 1. The momentum is 0 everywhere, except in the edges of the support. Then:
* to localize the wave in space at position 0 to reduce the space uncertainty, we have to reduce the support. However, doing so makes the momentum variation on the edges more and more important, as the slope will go up and down faster (higher top, and less x space for descent), leading to a larger variance (note that average momentum is still 0, due to to symmetry of the bump function)
* to localize the momentum as much as possible at 0, we can make the support wider and wider. This makes the bumps at the edges smaller and smaller. However, this also obviously delocalises the wave function more and more, increasing the variance of x

= Position and momentum space
{parent=uncertainty-principle}
{wiki}

One of the main reasons why physicists are obsessed by this topic is that position and momentum are mapped to the \x[phase-space-coordinate]{p} of \x[hamiltonian-mechanics], which appear in the \x[matrix-mechanics] formulation of \x[quantum-mechanics], which offers insight into the theory, particularly when generalizing to \x[relativistic-quantum-mechanics].

One way to think is: what is the definition of space space? It is a way to write the wave function $\psi_x(x)$ such that:
* the position operator is the multiplication by $x$
* the momentum operator is the derivative by $x$
And then, what is the definition of momentum space? It is of course a way to write the wave function $\psi_p(p)$ such that:
* the momentum operator is the multiplication by $p$

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/39442/intuitive-explanation-of-why-momentum-is-the-fourier-transform-variable-of-posit/39508#39508 gives the best idea intuitive idea: the \x[fourier-transform] writes a function as a (continuous) sum of plane waves, and each plane wave has a fixed momentum.

A way to write the wavefunction $\psi(x)$ such that the \x[position-operator] is:
$$x$$
i.e., a function that takes the wavefunction as input, and outputs another function:
$$x \psi(x)$$

If you believe that \x[mathematician]{p} took care of \x[continuous-spectrum-functional-analysis] for us and that everything just works, the most concrete and direct thing that this representation tells us is that:
\Q[the probability of finding a particle between $x_0$ and $x_1$ at time $t$]
equals:
$$\int_{x_0}^{x_1}x \psi{x, t} dx$$

This operator case is surprisingly not necessarily mathematically trivial to describe formally because you often end up getting into the \x[dirac-delta-function]{p}/continuous spectrum: as mentioned at: \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics]

= Momentum operator
{parent=position-and-momentum-space}
{wiki}

One dimension in \x[position-representation]:
$$
\hat{p} = - i \hbar \pdv{}{x}
$$

In three dimensions In position representation, we define it by using the \x[gradient], and so we see that 
$$
\hat{p} = - i \hbar \pdv{}{x}
$$

= Angular momentum operator
{parent=uncertainty-principle}
{wiki}

Basically the operators are just analogous to the classical ones e.g. the classical:
$$L_z = x p_y - y p_x$$
becomes:
$$\hat{L}_z = -i \hbar \left( x\pdv{}{y} - y\pdv{}{x} \right)$$

Besides the angular momentum in each direction, we also have the \x[total-angular-momentum]:
$$\hat{L}^2 = \hat{L}_x + \hat{L}_y + \hat{L}_z$$

Then you have to understand what each one of those does to the each \x[atomic-orbital]:
* total angular momentum: determined by the \x[azimuthal-quantum-number]
* angular momentum in one direction ($z$ by convention): determined by the \x[magnetic-quantum-number]

There is an \x[uncertainty-principle] between the x, y and z angular momentums, we can only measure one of them with certainty at a time. \x[video-quantum-mechanics-7a-angular-momentum-i-by-viascience-2013] justifies this intuitively by mentioning that this is analogous to \x[precession]: if you try to measure electrons e.g. with the \x[zeeman-effect] the precess on the other directions which you end up modifing.

Relates particle momentum and its wavelength, or equivalently, energy and frequency.

The wavelength relation is:
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$
but since:
$$
v = \lambda f
E = p v
$$
the wavelength relation implies:
$$
\frac{v}{f} = \frac{h}{p}
f = \frac{v p}{h}  = \frac{E}{h}
$$

Particle wavelength can be for example measured very directly on a \x[double-slit-experiment].

So if we take for example electrons of different speeds, we should be able to see the diffraction pattern change accordingly.

Published by \x[werner-heisenberg] in 1925-07-25 as \x[quantum-mechanical-re-interpretation-of-kinematic-and-mechanical-relations-by-heisenberg-1925], it offered the first general formulation of quantum mechanics.

It is apparently more closely related to the \x[ladder-operator] method, which is a more \x[algebraic] than the more \x[analytical] \x[schrodinger-equation].

It appears that this formulation makes the importance of the \x[poisson-bracket] clear, and explains why \x[physicist]{p} are so obsessed with talking about \x[position-and-momentum-space]. This point of view also apparently makes it clearer that \x[quantum-mechanics] can be seen as a generalization of \x[classical-mechanics] through the \x[hamiltonian].

\x[qed-and-the-men-who-made-it-dyson-feynman-schwinger-and-tomonaga-by-silvan-schweber-1994] mentions however that \x[relativistic-quantum-mechanics] broke that analogy, because some 2x2 matrix had a different form, TODO find that again.

Photon energy is proportional to its frequency:

$$
E = h * \nu
$$

This only makes sense if the \x[photon] exists, there is no classical analogue, because the energy of classical waves depends only on their amplitude, not frequency.

Proportionality factor in the \x[planck-einstein-relation] between light energy and frequency.

And analogously for matter, appears in the \x[de-broglie-relations] relating momentum and frequency. Also appears in the \x[schrodinger-equation], basically as a consequence/cause of the de Broglie relations most likely.

Intuitively, the \x[planck-constant] determines at what length scale do quantum effects start to show up for a given energy scale. It is because the Plank constant is very small that we don't perceive quantum effects on everyday energy/length/time scales. On the $\lim_{h \to 0}$, quantum mechanics disappears entirely.

A very direct way of thinking about it is to think about what would happen in a \x[double-slit-experiment]. TODO think more clearly what happens there.

Photon creation is easy because photons are massless, so there is not minimum energy to create them.

The creation of other particles is much rarer however, and took longer to be discovered, one notable milestone being the discovery of the \x[positron].

In the case of the electron, we need to start with at least enough energy for the mass of the electron positron pair. This requires a photon with wavelength in the \x[picometer] range, which is not common in the thermal radiation of daily life.

The Diract equation is the \x[spacetime-symmetry] part of the \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian], i.e. is describes how \x[spin-half] particles behave without interactions. The full \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian] can then be reached by adding the \x[u-1] \x[internal-symmetry].

As mentioned at \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics], this same method allows us to analogously derive the equations for other \x[spin-number]{p}.

Has some issues which are solved by the \x[dirac-equation]:
* it has a second time derivative of the \x[wave-function]. Therefore, to solve it we must specify not only the initial value of the wave equation, but also the derivative of the wave equation,

* the modulus of the wave function is not constant and therefore not always one, and therefore cannot be interpreted as a probability density anymore
* since we are working with the square of the energy, we have both positive and negative value solutions. This is also a features of the \x[dirac-equation] however.

= Derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation
{c}
{parent=klein-gordon-equation}

The Klein-Gordon equation directly uses a more naive \x[relativistic-energy] guess of $p^2 + m^2$ squared.

But since this is \x[quantum-mechanics], we feel like making $p$ into the "\x[momentum-operator]", just like in the \x[schrodinger-equation].

But we don't really know how to apply the momentum operator twice, because it is a \x[gradient], so the first application goes from a scalar field to the vector field, and the second one...

So we just cheat and try to use the \x[laplace-operator] instead because there's some squares on it:
$$
H = \laplacian{} + m^2
$$

But then, we have to avoid taking the square root to reach a first derivative in time, because we don't know how to take the square root of that operator expression.

So the Klein-Gordon equation just takes the approach of using this squared Hamiltonian instead.

Since it is a Hamiltonian, and comparing it to the \x[schrodinger-equation] which looks like:
$$
H \psi = i \pdv{\psi}{t}
$$
taking the Hamiltonian twice leads to:
$$
H^2 \psi = - \pdv{^2 \psi}{^2 t}
$$

We can contrast this with the \x[dirac-equation], which instead attempts to explicitly construct an operator which squared coincides with the relativistic formula: \x[derivation-of-the-dirac-equation].

Spin is one of the \x[defining-properties-of-elementary-particles], i.e. number that describes how an \x[elementary-particle] behaves, much like \x[electric-charge] and \x[mass].

Possible values are half integer numbers: 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and so on.

The approach shown in this section: \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics]{c}{full} shows what the spin number actually means in general. As shown there, the spin number it is a direct consequence of having the laws of nature be \x[lorentz-invariant]. Different spin numbers are just different ways in which this can be achieved as per different \x[representation-of-the-lorentz-group].

\x[video-quantum-mechanics-9a-photon-spin-and-schrodinger-s-cat-i-by-viascience-2013] explains nicely how:
* incorporated into the \x[dirac-equation] as a natural consequence of \x[special-relativity] corrections, but not naturally present in the \x[schrodinger-equation], see also: \x[the-dirac-equation-predicts-spin]{child}
* \x[photon] spin can be either linear or circular
* the linear one can be made from a superposition of circular ones
* straight antennas produce linearly polarized photos, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helical_antenna[Helical antennas] circularly polarized ones
* a jump between 2s and 2p in an atom changes angular momentum. Therefore, the photon must carry angular momentum as well as energy.
* cannot be classically explained, because even for a very large estimate of the electron size, its surface would have to spin faster than light to achieve that magnetic momentum with the known \x[electron-charge]
* as shown at \x[video-quantum-mechanics-12b-dirac-equation-ii-by-viascience-2015], observers in different \x[frame-of-reference][frames of reference] see different spin states

Best mathematical explanation: \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics]{c}{full}.

\x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 3.9 "Elementary particles" has an amazing summary of the preceding chapters the \x[spin-physics] value has a relation to the \x[representation-theory][representations] of the \x[lorentz-group], which encodes the \x[spacetime-symmetry] that each particle observes. These symmetries can be characterized by small integer numbers:
* \x[spin-0]: $(0, 0)$ representation
* \x[spin-half]: $(1/2, 0) \bigoplus (0, 1/2)$ representation
* \x[spin-1]: $(1/2, 1/2)$ representation
\x[parameters-of-the-standard-model][As usual], we don't know why there aren't \x[elementary-particle]{p} with other spins, as we could construct them.

Remember that $\psi$ is a 4-vetor, gamma matrices are 4x4 matrices, so the whole thing comes down to a \x[dot-product] of two 4-vectors, with a modified $\psi$ by matrix multiplication/derivatives, and the result is a scalar, as expected for a \x[lagrangian].

{synonym}
{title2}

Theoretical framework on which quantum field theories are based, theories based on framework include:
* \x[quantum-electrodynamics]
* \x[quantum-chromodynamics]
so basically the entire \x[standard-model]

The basic idea is that there is a field for each particle particle type.

E.g. in QED, one for the \x[electron] and one for the \x[photon]: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/166709/are-electron-fields-and-photon-fields-part-of-the-same-field-in-qed[].

And then those fields interact with some \x[lagrangian].

One way to look at QFT is to split it into two parts:
* deriving the Lagrangians of the \x[standard-model]: \x[why-do-symmetries-such-as-su-3-su-2-and-u-1-matter-in-particle-physics]. This is the easier part, since the lagrangians themselves can be understood with not very advanced mathematics, and derived beautifully from symmetry constraints
* the qantization of fields. This is the hard part \x[ciro-santilli] is unable to understand, TODO \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-field-theory].
Then interwined with those two is the part "OK, how to solve the equations, if they are solvable at all", which is an open problem: \x[yang-mills-existence-and-mass-gap].

There appear to be two main equivalent formulations of quantum field theory:
* \x[second-quantization]
* \x[path-integral-formulation]

{parent=quantum-field-theory}

TODO holy crap, even this is hard to understand/find a clear definition of.

The \x[dirac-equation], OK, is a \x[partial-differential-equation], so we can easily understand its definition with basic calculus. We may not be able to solve it efficiently, but at least we understand it.

But what the heck is the mathematical model for a quantum field theory? TODO someone was saying it is equivalent to an infinite set of PDEs somehow. Investigate. Related:

* https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/155608/what-is-a-quantum-field

The \x[path-integral-formulation] might actually be the most understandable formulation, as shown at \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].

The formulation of QFT also appears to be a form of infinite-dimentional calculus.

\x[quantum-electrodynamics-by-lifshitz-et-al-2nd-edition-1982] chapter 1. "The uncertainty principle in the relativistic case" contains an interesting idea:
\Q[The foregoing discussion suggests that the theory will not consider the time dependence of particle interaction processes. It will show that in these processes there are no characteristics precisely definable (even within the usual limitations of quantum mechanics); the description of such a process as occurring in the course of time is therefore just as unreal as the classical paths are in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The only observable quantities are the properties (momenta,
polarizations) of free particles: the initial particles which come into interaction, and the final particles which result from the process.]

{parent=mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-field-theory}

The term and idea was first introduced initialized by \x[hermann-weyl] when he was working on combining \x[electromagnetism] and \x[general-relativity] to formulate \x[maxwell-s-equations-in-curved-spacetime] in 1918 and published as \x[gravity-and-electricity-by-hermann-weyl-1918]. Based on perception that \x[u-1] symmetry implies \x[charge-conservation]. The same idea was later adapted for \x[quantum-electrodynamics], a context in which is has even more impact.

https://www.quora.com/How-are-quantum-fields-quantized-to-describe-particles

Second quantization also appears to be useful not only for \x[relativistic-quantum-mechanics], but also for \x[condensed-matter-physics]. The reason is that the basis idea is to use the number occupation basis. This basis is:
* convenient for \x[quantum-field-theory] because of \x[particle-creation-and-annihilation] changes the number of particles all the time
* convenient for \x[condensed-matter-physics] because there you have a gazillion particles occupying entire \x[electronic-band-theory][energy bands]

This one might actually be understandable! It is what \x[richard-feynman] starts to explain at: \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].

The difficulty is then proving that the total probability remains at 1, and maybe causality is hard too.

The path integral formulation can be seen as a generalization of the \x[double-slit-experiment] to infinitely many slits.

Feynman first stared working it out for \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics], with the relativistic goal in mind, and only later on he attained the relativistic goal.

TODO why intuitively did he take that approach? Likely is makes it easier to add \x[special-relativity].

This approach more directly suggests the idea that \x[quantum-particles-take-all-possible-paths].

Theory that describes \x[electron]{p} and \x[photon]{p} really well, and \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979][as Feynman puts it] "accounts very precisely for all physical phenomena we have ever observed, except for gravity and nuclear physics" ("including the laughter of the crowd" ;-)).

Learning it is one of \x[ciro-santilli]'s main intellectual \x[fetish]{p}.

While Ciro acknowledges that QED is intrinsically challenging due to the wide range or requirements (\x[quantum-mechanics], \x[special-relativity] and \x[electromagnetism]), Ciro feels that there is a glaring gap in this moneyless market for a learning material that follows the \x[middle-way] as mentioned at: \x[the-missing-link-between-basic-and-advanced]. \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979] is one of the best attempts so far, but it falls a bit too close to the superficial side of things, if only Feynman hadn't assumed that the audience doesn't know any mathematics...

The funny thing is that when \x[ciro-santilli-s-mother] retired, learning it (or as she put it: "how photons and electrons interact") was also one of her retirement plans. She is a pharmacist by training, and doesn't know much \x[mathematics], and her \x[english-language] was \x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world][somewhat limited]. Oh, she also wanted to learn how \x[photosynthesis] works (possibly not fully understood by science as that time, 2020). Ambitious old lady!!!

Experiments: \x[quantum-electrodynamics-experiments].

Combines \x[special-relativity] with more classical \x[quantum-mechanics], but further generalizing the \x[dirac-equation], which also does that: \x[dirac-equation-vs-quantum-electrodynamics].

Before QED, the most advanced theory was that of the \x[dirac-equation], which was already relativistic but TODO what was missing there exactly?

As summarized at: https://youtube.com/watch?v=_AZdvtf6hPU?t=305[] Quantum Field Theory lecture at the African Summer Theory Institute 1 of 4 by Anthony Zee (2004):
* classical mechanics describes large and slow objects
* special relativity describes large and fast objects (they are getting close to the speed of light, so we have to consider relativity)
* classical \x[quantum-mechanics] describes small and slow objects.
* QED describes objects that are both small and fast

That video also mentions the interesting idea that:
* in special relativity, we have the \x[mass-energy-equivalence]
* in quantum mechanics, thinking along the \x[time-energy-uncertainty-principle], $\Delta E \sim \frac{1}{\Delta t}$
Therefore, for small timescales, energy can vary a lot. But mass is equivalent to energy. Therefore, for small time scale, particles can appear and disappear wildly.

QED is the first \x[quantum-field-theory] fully developed. That framework was later extended to also include the \x[weak-interaction] and \x[strong-interaction]. As a result, it is perhaps easier to just \x[google] for "Quantum Field Theory" if you want to learn QED, since QFT is more general and has more resources available generally.

Like in more general quantum field theory, there is on field for each particle type. In quantum field theory, there are only two fields to worry about:
* \x[photon] field
* \x[electromagnetism] field

$$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{QED}} = \bar \psi (i\hbar c {D}\!\!\!\!/\ - mc^2) \psi - {1 \over 4\mu_0} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}$$
where:
* $F$ is the \x[electromagnetic-tensor]

Note that this is the sum of the:
* \x[dirac-lagrangian], which  only describes the "inertia of bodies" part of the equation
* the \x[electromagnetic] interaction term ${1 \over 4\mu_0} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}$, which describes term describes forces
Note that the relationship between $\psi$ and $F$ is not explicit. However, if we knew what type of particle we were talking about, e.g. \x[electron], then the knowledge of \x[psi] would also give the charge distribution and therefore $F$

As mentioned at the beginning of \x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-notes-by-david-tong-2007]:
* by "\x[lagrangian]" we mean Lagrangian density
* the \x[generalized-coordinate]{p} of the Lagrangian are fields

Like the rest of the \x[standard-model-lagrangian], this can be split into two parts:
* \x[spacetime-symmetry]: reaches the \x[derivation-of-the-dirac-equation], but has no interactions
* add the \x[u-1] \x[internal-symmetry] to add interactions, which reaches the full equation

\Video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFRyN3fQMO8]
{title=Deriving the \x[qed-lagrangian] by \x[dietterich-labs] (2018)}
{description=As mentioned at the start of the video, he starts with the \x[dirac-equation] Lagrangian derived in a previous video. It has nothing to do with \x[electromagnetism] specifically.

He notes that that \x[dirac-lagrangian], besides being globally \x[lorentz-invariant], it also also has a global \x[u-1] invariance.

However, it does not have a local invariance if the \x[u-1] transformation depends on the point in spacetime.

He doesn't mention it, but I think this is highly desirable, because in general \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents], and in this case we want conservation of charges.

To fix that, he adds an extra \x[gauge-field] $A_\mu$ (a field of $4 \times 4$ matrices) to the regular derivative, and the resulting derivative has a fancy name: the \x[covariant-derivative].

Then finally he notes that this \x[gauge-field] he had to add has to transform exactly like the \x[electromagnetic-four-potential]!

So he uses that as the gauge, and also adds in the \x[maxwell-lagrangian] in the same go. It is kind of a guess, but it is a natural guess, and it turns out to be correct.

= What does it mean that photons are force carriers for electromagnetism?
{parent=quantum-electrodynamics}

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/61095/photon-as-the-carrier-of-the-electromagnetic-force

TODO find/create decent answer.

I think the best answer is something along:
* \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents]. $U(1)$ gives conserved charges.
* OK now. We want a local $U(1)$ symmetry. And we also want:
  * \x[dirac-equation]: quantum relativistic Newton's laws that specify what forces do to the fields
  * \x[electromagnetism]: specifies what causes forces based on currents. But not what it does to masses.
  Given all of that, the most obvious and direct thing we reach a guess at the \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian] is \x[video-deriving-the-qed-lagrangian-by-dietterich-labs-2018]

A basic non-precise intuition is that a good model of reality is that electrons do not "interact with one another directly via the electromagnetic field".

A better model happens to be the \x[quantum-field-theory] view that the electromagnetic field interacts with the photon field but not directly with itself, and then the photon field interacts with parts of the electromagnetic field further away.

The more precise statement is that the \x[photon-field] is a gauge field of the electromagnetic force under local U(1) symmetry, which is described by a \x[lie-group]. TODO understand.

This idea was first applied in \x[general-relativity], where \x[einstein] understood that the "force of \x[gravity]" can be understood just in terms of symmetry and curvature of space. This was later applied o \x[quantum-electrodynamics] and the entire \x[standard-model].

From \x[video-lorenzo-sadun-on-the-yang-mills-and-mass-gap-millennium-problem]:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCQ9GIqpGBI&t=1663s mentions this idea first came about from \x[hermann-weyl].
* https://youtu.be/pCQ9GIqpGBI?t=2827 mentions that in that case the curvature is given by the \x[electromagnetic-tensor].

By \x[richard-feynman]{parent}.

Talk title shown on intro: "Today's Answers to Newton's Queries about Light".

6 hour lecture, where he tries to explain it to an audience that does not know any modern physics. This is a noble effort.

Part of The Douglas Robb Memorial Lectures lecture series.

Feynman apparently also made a book adaptation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED:_The_Strange_Theory_of_Light_and_Matter[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]. That book is basically word by word the same as the presentation, including the diagrams.

According to http://www.feynman.com/science/qed-lectures-in-new-zealand/ the official upload is at http://www.vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8[] and Vega does show up as a watermark on the video (though it is too pixilated to guess without knowing it), a project that has been discontinued and has has a non-permissive license. Newbs.

4 parts:
* Part 1: is saying "\x[photon]{p} exist"
* Part 2: is amazing, and describes how photons move as a sum of all possible paths, not sure if it is relativistic at all though, and suggests that something is minimized in that calculation (the \x[action-physics])
* Part 3: is where he hopelessly tries to explain the crucial part of how electrons join the picture in a similar manner to how photons do.

  He does make the link to light, saying that there is a function $P(A, B)$ which gives the amplitude for a photon going from A to B, where A and B are spacetime events.

  And then he mentions that there is a similar function $E(A, B)$ for an electron to go from A to B, but says that that function is too complicated, and gives no intuition unlike the photon one.

  He does not mention it, but P and E are the so called \x[propagator]{p}.

  This is likely the \x[path-integral-formulation] of QED.

  On \x[quantum-mechanical-view-of-reality-by-richard-feynman-1983] he mentions that $E$ is a \x[bessel-function], without giving further detail.

  And also mentions that:
  $$
  E = f(1, 2, m) \\
  P = f(1, 2, 0)
  $$
  where `m` is basically a scale factor.
  such that both are very similar. And that something similar holds for many other particles.

  And then, when you draw a \x[feynman-diagram], e.g. electron emits photon and both are detected at given positions, you sum over all the possibilities, each amplitude is given by:
  $$
  c \times E(A, D) \times E(D, B) \times P(B, C)
  $$
  summed over all possible $D$ \x[spacetime] points.

  This is basically well said at: https://youtu.be/rZvgGekvHes?t=3349 from \x[quantum-mechanical-view-of-reality-by-richard-feynman-1983].

  TODO: how do electron velocities affect where they are likely to end up? $E(A, D)$ suggests the probability only depends on the spacetime points.

  Also, this clarifies why computations in QED are so insane: you have to sum over every possible point in space!!! TODO but then how do we calculate anything at all in practice?
* Part 4: known problems with QED and thoughts on QCD. Boring.

= Weak force
{synonym}

Explains \x[beta-decay]. TODO why/how.

Maybe a good view of why this force was needed given \x[beta-decay] experiments is: in beta decay, a \x[neutron] is getting split up into an \x[electron] and a \x[proton]. Therefore, those charges must be contained inside the neutron somehow to start with. But then what could possibly make a positive and a negative particle separate?
* the \x[electromagnetic-force] should hold them together
* the \x[strong-force] seems to hold positive charges together. Could it then be pushing opposite-charges apart? Why not?
* \x[gravity] is too weak

http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/Weak-nuclear-force.html gives a quick and dirty:
\Q[
Beta decay could not be explained by the strong nuclear force, the force that's responsible for holding the atomic nucleus together, because this force doesn't affect electrons. It couldn't be explained by the electromagnetic force, because this does not affect \x[neutron]{p}, and the force of \x[gravity] is far too weak to be responsible. Since this new atomic force was not as strong as the strong nuclear force, it was dubbed the weak nuclear force.
]
Also interesting:
\Q[
While the photon 'carries' charge, and therefore mediates the \x[electromagnetic-force], the \x[z-boson][Z] and \x[w-boson][W] \x[boson]{p} are said to carry a property known as 'weak isospin'. \x[w-boson]{p} mediate the weak force when particles with charge are involved, and \x[z-boson]{p} mediate the weak force when neutral particles are involved.

The different only shows up for \x[field-physics], not with particles. For fields, there are two types of changes that we can make that can keep the \x[lagrangian] unchanged as mentioned at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter "4.5.2 Noether's Theorem for Field Theories - Spacetime":
* \x[spacetime-symmetry]: act with the \x[poincare-group] on the \x[four-vector] spacetime inputs of the field itself, i.e. transforming $L(\Phi(x), \partial \Phi(x), dx)$ into $L(\Phi'(x'), \partial \Phi'(x'), x')$
* \x[internal-symmetry]: act on the output of the  field, i.e.: $L(\Phi(x) + \delta \Phi(x), \partial (\Phi(x) + \delta \Phi(x)), x)$

From \x[defining-properties-of-elementary-particles]:
* spacetime:
  * \x[mass]
  * \x[spin-physics]
* internal
  * \x[electric-charge]
  * \x[weak-charge]

From the spacetime theory alone, we can derive the \x[lagrangian] for the free theories for each \x[spin-physics]:

Author: \x[david-tong]{parent}.

Number of pages circa 2021: 155.

It should also be noted that those notes are still being updated circa 2020 much after original publication. But without \x[git] to track the \x[latex], it is hard to be sure how much. \x[ourbigbook-com][We'll get there one day, one day].

Likely used at: \x[david-tong-s-2009-quantum-field-theory-lectures-at-the-perimeter-institute].

Some quotes self describing the work:
* \Q[
  \x[an-introduction-to-quantum-field-theory-by-peskin-and-schroeder-1995]

  This is a very clear and comprehensive book, covering everything in this course at the right level. To a large extent, our course will follow the first section of this book.
  ]
  Perhaps for this reason \x[ciro-santilli] was not able to get as much as he'd out of those notes either. This is not to say that the notes are bad, just not what Ciro needed, much like P&S:
  * \x[the-missing-link-between-basic-and-advanced]

Free to view draft: https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/ms-qft-DRAFT.pdf Page presenting it: http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html

Author affiliation: University of California, Santa Barbara.

Number of pages: 616!

Don't redistribute clause, and final version by Cambridge University Press, alas, so corrections will never be merged back: http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html[]. But at least he's collecing erratas for the published (and therefore draft) versions there.

The book is top-level organized in spin 0, spin half, and spin 1. Quite ominous, really.

The preface states that one of its pedagogical philosophies is to "Illustration of the basic concepts with the simplest examples.", so maybe there is hope after all.

Bibliography review:
* \x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-notes-by-david-tong-2007] is the course basis
* \x[quantum-field-theory-in-a-nutshell-by-anthony-zee-2010] is a good quick and dirty book to start

Course outline given:
* classical field theory
* quantum scalar field. Covers \x[boson]{p}, and is simpler to get intuition about.
* quantum Dirac field. Covers \x[fermion]{p}
* interacting fields
* \x[perturbation-theory]
* \x[renormalization]

Non-relativistic \x[qft] is a limit of relativistic QFT, and can be used to describe for example \x[condensed-matter-physics] systems at very low temperature. But it is still very hard to make accurate measurements even in those experiments.

Defines "relativistic" as: "the \x[lagrangian] is symmetric under the \x[poincare-group]".

Mentions that "QFT is hard" because (a finite list follows???):
\Q[There are no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary \x[representation-theory][representations] of the \x[poincare-group].]
But I guess that if you fully understand what that means precisely, QTF won't be too hard for you!

Notably, this is stark contrast with rotation symmetry groups (\x[special-orthogonal-group][SO(3)]) which appears in space rotations present in \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics].

{parent=quantum-field-theory-book}

This didn't really deliver. It does start from the basics, but it is often hard to link those basics to more interesting or deeper points. Also like many other \x[quantum-field-theory-book], it does not seem to contain a single comparison between a theoretical result and an experiment.

= Quantum superposition
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

Quantum superposition is really weird because it is fundamentally different than "either definite state but I don't know which", because the superposition state leads to different measurements than the non-superposition state.

Examples:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt8gVXDsh7Q "Interference in quantum mechanics" by \x[looking-glass-universe] (2015) shows how a left-right \x[spin-physics] measurement has a defined value for a superposed half up half down state, but not for a pure up state.

  TODO can this be conducted? As mentioned in the video, this is closely linked to the fact that you can describe the wave function in multiple different bases (up/down or left/right), which is also at the root of the \x[uncertainty-principle].
* \x[video-quantum-mechanics-9b-photon-spin-and-schrodinger-s-cat-ii-by-viascience-2013] gives a similar photon version
* it seems that the \x[single-particle-double-slit-experiment] can also be thought of as in terms of a superposition of "the particle goes through the right" and "the particle goes through the right", although it is a bit harder to thing about as it is not a \x[discrete] process

= Entanglement
{synonym}

Quantum entanglement is often called spooky/surprising/unintuitive, but they key question is to understand why.

To understand that, you have to understand why it is fundamentally impossible for the entangled particle pair be in a predefined state \x[bell-test-experiment][according to experiments done] e.g. where one is deterministically yes and the other deterministically down.

In other words, why \x[local-hidden-variable-theory] is not valid.

* for \x[photon]{p}, notably: \x[spontaneous-parametric-down-conversion], e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn1sEaw1K2k "Shanni Prutchi Construction of an Entangled Photon Source" by HACKADAY (2015). Estimatd price: 5000 USD.
