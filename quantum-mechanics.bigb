Quantum mechanics is quite a broad term. Perhaps it is best to start approaching it from the division into:
* <non-relativistic quantum mechanics>: obviously the simpler one, and where you should start
* <relativistic quantum mechanics>: more advanced, and arguably "less useful"

Key experiments that could not work without quantum mechanics: <quantum mechanics experiment>{full}.

Mathematics: there are a few models of increasing precision which could all be called "quantum mechanics":
* <Schrödinger equation>
* <Dirac equation>
* <quantum electrodynamics>

<Ciro Santilli> feels that the <deep tech>[largest technological revolutions since the 1950's have been quantum related], and will continue to be for a while, from deeper understanding of chemistry and materials to <quantum computing>, understanding and controlling quantum systems is where the most interesting frontier of technology lies.

{parent=Spectral line}

<NIST> database for <spectral line>: https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html

Let's do a sanity check.

Searching for "H" for <hydrogen> leads to: https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ASD/lines1.pl?spectra=H&limits_type=0&low_w=&upp_w=&unit=1&submit=Retrieve+Data&de=0&format=0&line_out=0&en_unit=0&output=0&bibrefs=1&page_size=15&show_obs_wl=1&show_calc_wl=1&unc_out=1&order_out=0&max_low_enrg=&show_av=2&max_upp_enrg=&tsb_value=0&min_str=&A_out=0&intens_out=on&max_str=&allowed_out=1&forbid_out=1&min_accur=&min_intens=&conf_out=on&term_out=on&enrg_out=on&J_out=on

From there we can see for example the 1 to 2 lines:
* 1s to 2p: 121.5673644608 nm
* 1s to 2: 121.56701 nm TODO what does that $2$ mean?
* 1s to 2s: 121.5673123130200 TODO what does that mean?

We see that the table is sorted from lower from level first and then by upper level second.

So it is good to see that we are in the same 121nm ballpark as mentioned at <hydrogen spectral line>.

TODO why I can't see 2s to 2p transitions there to get the <fine structure>?

https://phys.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD%3A_Physics_9HE_-_Modern_Physics/06%3A_Emission_and_Absorption_of_Photons/6.2%3A_Selection_Rules_and_Transition_Times has some very good mentions:
\Q[
So it appears that if a hydrogen atom emits a photon, it not only has to transition between two states whose energy difference matches the energy of the photon, but it is restricted in other ways as well, if its mode of radiation is to be dipole. For example, a hydrogen atom in its 3p state must drop to either the n=1 or n=2 energy level, to make the energy available to the photon. The n=2 energy level is 4-fold degenerate, and including the single n=1 state, the atom has five different states to which it can transition. But three of the states in the n=2 energy level have l=1 (the 2p states), so transitioning to these states does not involve a change in the angular momentum quantum number, and the dipole mode is not available.

So what's the big deal? Why doesn't the hydrogen atom just use a quadrupole or higher-order mode for this transition? It can, but the characteristic time for the dipole mode is so much shorter than that for the higher-order modes, that by the time the atom gets around to transitioning through a higher-order mode, it has usually already done so via dipole. All of this is statistical, of course, meaning that in a large collection of hydrogen atoms, many different modes of transitions will occur, but the vast majority of these will be dipole.

It turns out that examining details of these restrictions introduces a couple more. These come about from the conservation of angular momentum. It turns out that photons have an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) magnitude of $\hbar$, which means whenever a photon (emitted or absorbed) causes a transition in a hydrogen atom, the value of l must change (up or down) by exactly 1. This in turn restricts the changes that can occur to the magnetic quantum number: $m_l$ can change by no more than 1 (it can stay the same). We have dubbed these transition restrictions selection rules, which we summarize as:

$$
\Delta l = \pm 1, \Delta m_l = 0, \pm 1
$$

The discovery of the <photon> was one of the major initiators of quantum mechanics.

Light was very well known to be a wave through <diffraction> experiments. So how could it also be a particle???

This was a key development for people to eventually notice that the <electron> is also a wave.

This process "started" in 1900 with <Planck's law> which was based on discrete energy packets being exchanged as exposed at <On the Theory of the Energy Distribution Law of the Normal Spectrum by Max Planck (1900)>.

This ideas was reinforced by <Einstein>'s explanation of the <photoelectric effect> in 1905 in terms of <photon>.

In the next big development was the <Bohr model> in 1913, which supposed non-<classical physics> new quantization rules for the <electron> which explained the <hydrogen emission spectrum>. The quantization rule used made use of the <Planck constant>, and so served an initial link between the emerging quantized nature of <light>, and that of the <electron>.

The final phase started in 1923, when <Louis de Broglie> proposed that in analogy to photons, <electrons> might also be waves, a statement made more precise through the <de Broglie relations>.

This event opened the floodgates, and soon <matrix mechanics> was published in <quantum mechanical re-interpretation of kinematic and mechanical relations by Heisenberg (1925)>, as the first coherent formulation of <quantum mechanics>.

It was followed by the <Schrödinger equation> in 1926, which proposed an equivalent <partial differential equation> formulation to <matrix mechanics>, a mathematical formulation that was more familiar to <physicists> than the matrix ideas of Heisenberg.

<Inward Bound by Abraham Pais (1988)> summarizes his views of the main developments of the subjectit:
\Q[
* Planck's on the discovery of the quantum theory (1900);
* Einstein's on the light-quantum (1905);

= Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics
{parent=Quantum mechanics}
{wiki}

These are the key mathematical ideas to understand!!

There are actually a few formulations out there. By far the dominant one as of 2020 has been the <Schrödinger picture>, which contrasts notably with the <Heisenberg picture>.

Another well known one is the <de Broglie-Bohm theory>, which is deterministic, but <non-local>.

= Schrödinger picture
{c}
{parent=Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics}

The state of a quantum system is a vector of unit length in a <Hilbert space>. TODO why Hilbert Space.

"Making a measurement" for an <observable> means applying a <self-adjoint operator> to the state, and after a measurement is done:
* the state <wave function collapse>[collapses] to an <eigenvector> of the self adjoint operator
* the result of the measurement is the <eigenvalue> of the self adjoint operator
* the probability of a given result happening when the spectrum is <discrete> is proportional to the modulus of the projection on that eigenvector.

  For continuous spectra such as that of the <position operator> in most systems, e.g. <Schrödinger equation for a free one dimensional particle>, the projection on each individual eigenvalue is zero, i.e. the probability of one absolutely exact position is zero. To get a non-zero result, measurement has to be done on a continuous range of eigenvectors (e.g. for position: "is the particle present between x=0 and x=1?"), and you have to integrate the probability over the projection on a continuous range of eigenvalues.

  In such continuous cases, the probability collapses to an uniform distribution on the range after measurement.

  The continuous position operator case is well illustrated at: <video Visualization of Quantum Physics (Quantum Mechanics) by udiprod (2017)>
Those last two rules are also known as the <born rule>.

Self adjoint operators are chosen because they have the following key properties:
* their eigenvalues form an orthonormal basis
* they are diagonalizable

See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics

Perhaps the easiest case to understand this for is that of <spin (physics)>, which has only a finite number of eigenvalues. Although it is a shame that fully understanding that requires a <special relativity>[relativistic] quantum theory such as the <Dirac equation>.

The next steps are to look at simple 1D bound states such as <particle in a box> and <quantum harmonic oscillator>.

This naturally generalizes to <Schrödinger equation solution for the hydrogen atom>.

The solution to the <Schrödinger equation for a free one dimensional particle> is a bit harder since the possible energies do not make up a <countable set>.

This formulation was apparently called more precisely <Dirac-von Neumann axioms>, but it because so dominant we just call it "the" formulation.

<Quantum Field Theory lecture notes by David Tong (2007)> mentions that:
\Q[if you were to write the wavefunction in quantum field theory, it would be a functional, that is a function of every possible configuration of the field $\phi$.]

= Wave function collapse
{parent=Schrödinger picture}
{wiki}

Similar to <quantum jump> in the <Bohr model>, but for the <Schrödinger equation>.

The idea the the wave function of a small observed system collapses "obviously" cannot be the full physical truth, only a very useful approximation of reality.

Because then are are hard pressed to determine the boundary between what collapses and what doesn't, and there isn't such a boundary, as everything is interacting, including the observer.

The <many-worlds interpretation> is an elegant explanation for this. Though it does feel a bit sad and superfluous.

{parent=Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics}
{wiki=Bra–ket_notation}

= Bra-ket
{synonym}

Notation used in <quantum mechanics>.

Ket is just a <vector (mathematics)>. Though generally in the context of <quantum mechanics>, this is an infinite dimensional vector in a <Hilbert space> like <l2>.

Bra is just the <dual vector> corresponding to a ket, or in other words <projection (mathematics)> <linear operator>, i.e. a linear function which can act on a given vector and returns a single <complex number>. Also known as... <dot product>.

For example:
$$
(\bra{x}) \ket{y}
$$
is basically a fancy way of saying:
$$
x \cdot y
$$
that is: we are taking the projection of $y$ along the $x$ direction. Note that in the ordinary dot product notation however, we don't differentiate as clearly what is a vector and what is an operator, while the bra-ket notation makes it clear.

The projection operator is completely specified by the vector that we are projecting it on. This is why the bracket notation makes sense.

It also has the merit of clearly differentiating vectors from operators. E.g. it is not very clear in $x \cdot y$ that $x$ is an operator and $y$ is a vector, except due to the relative position to the dot. This is especially bad when we start manipulating operators by themselves without vectors.

This notation is widely used in <quantum mechanics> because calculating the <probability> of getting a certain outcome for an experiment is calculated by taking the projection of a state on one an <eigenvalue> basis vector as explained at: <mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics>{full}.

Making the projection operator "look like a thing" (the bra) is nice because we can add and multiply them much like we can for vectors (they also form a <vector space>), e.g.:
$$
\bra{x} + \bra{y}
$$
just means taking the projection along the $x + y$ direction.

<Ciro Santilli> thinks that this notation is a bit over-engineered. Notably the bra's are just vectors, which we should just write as usual with $\va{v}$... the bra thing makes it look scarier than it needs to be. And then we should just find a different notation for the projection part.

Maybe <Dirac> chose it because of the appeal of the women's piece of clothing: <bra>, in an irresistible call from <British humour>.

But in any case, alas, we are now stuck with it.

The <partial differential equation> of <special relativity>[non-relativistic] <quantum mechanics>.

Experiments explained:
* via the <Schrödinger equation solution for the hydrogen atom> it predicts:
  * <spectral line> basic lines, plus <Zeeman effect>
* <Schrödinger equation solution for the helium atom>: perturbative solutions give good approximations to the energy levels
* <double-slit experiment>: I think we have a closed solution for the max and min probabilities on the measurement wall, and they match experiments

Experiments not explained: those that the <Dirac equation> explains like:
* <fine structure>
* <spontaneous emission> coefficients

To get some intuition on the equation on the consequences of the equation, have a look at:
* <Schrödinger equation simulations>
* <solutions of the Schrodinger equation>

The easiest to understand case of the equation which you must have in mind initially that of the <Schrödinger equation for a free one dimensional particle>.

Then, with that in mind, the general form of the <Schrödinger equation> is:
$$
i\hbar\pdv{\psi(\vv{x}, t)}{t} = \hat{H}[\psi(\vv{x}, t)]
$$
{title=Schrodinger equation}
where:
* $\hbar$ is the <reduced Planck constant>
* $\psi$ is the <wave function>
* $t$ is the time
* $\hat{H}$ is a <linear operator> called the <Hamiltonian>. It takes as input a function $\psi$, and returns another function. This plays a role analogous to the Hamiltonian in <classical mechanics>: determining it determines what the physical system looks like, and how the system evolves in time, because we can just plug it into the equation and solve it. It basically encodes the total energy and forces of the system.

The $\vv{x}$ argument of $\psi$ could be anything, e.g.:
* we could have preferred <polar coordinates> instead of linear ones if the potential were symmetric around a point
* we could have more than one particle, e.g. <solutions of the Schrodinger equation for two electrons>, which would have e.g. $x_1$ and $x_2$ for different particles. No matter how many particles there are, we have just a single $\psi$, we just add more arguments to it.
* we could have even more generalized coordinates. This is much in the spirit of <Hamiltonian mechanics> or <generalized coordinates>
Note however that there is always a single magical $t$ time variable. This is needed in particular because there is a time <partial derivative> in the equation, so there must be a corresponding time variable in the function. This makes the equation explicitly <non-relativistic>.

The general <Schrödinger equation> can be broken up into a trivial time-dependent and a <time-independent Schrödinger equation> by separation of variables. So in practice, all we need to solve is the slightly simpler <time-independent Schrödinger equation>, and the full equation comes out as a result.

Existence and uniqueness: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/212913/existence-and-uniqueness-for-two-dimensional-time-dependent-schr%C3%B6dinger-equation

= Time-independent Schrödinger equation
{parent=Schrödinger equation}
{wiki=Schrödinger_equation#Time-independent_equation}

The cool thing about the <Time-independent Schrödinger equation> is that we can always reduce solving the full <Schrödinger equation> to solving this slightly simpler time-independent version.

This is actually the approach that we will always take <solutions of the Schrodinger equation>[when solving the schrodinger equation], see e.g. <quantum harmonic oscillator>.

Before reading any further, you \i[must] understand <heat equation solution with Fourier series>, which uses <separation of variables>.

Once that example is clear, we see that the exact same <separation of variables> can be done to the <Schrödinger equation>. If we name the constant of the separation of variables $E$ for energy, we get::
* a time-only part that does not depend on space and does not depend on the <Hamiltonian> at all. The solution for this part is therefore always the same exponentials for any problem, and this part is therefore "boring":
  $$
  e^{-iEt/\hbar}
  $$
* a space-only part that does not depend on time, bud does depend on the hamiltonian:

  $$
  \hat{H}[\psi(\vv{x})] = E \psi{\vv{x}}
  $$
  {title=Time-independent Schrodinger equation}

  Since this is the only non-trivial part, unlike the time part which is trivial, this spacial part is just called "the time-independent Schrodinger equation".

  Note that the $\psi$ here is not the same as the $\psi$ in the <equation Schrodinger equation>[time-dependent Schrodinger equation] of course, as that psi is the result of the multiplication of the time and space parts. This is a bit of imprecise terminology, but hey, physics.

Because the time part of the equation is always the same and always trivial to solve, all we have to do to actually solve the Schrodinger equation is to solve the time independent one, and then we can construct the full solution trivially.

Once we've solve the time-independent part, call it for each discrete energy $E_i$ as $E_i\psi_i(x)$, we proceed exactly as we did in <heat equation solution with Fourier series>: we make a weighted sum over all possible $E$ to match the initial condition, which is analogous to the <Fourier series> in the case of the heat equation to reach a final full solution:
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-iEt/\hbar} E_i\psi_i(x)
$$
{title=Solution of the Schrodinger equation in terms of the time-independent and time dependent parts}
and this is a solution by selecting $E_i$ such that at time $t = 0$ we match the intial condition:
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-iE0/\hbar} E_i\psi_i(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} E_i\psi_i(x) = initial condition
$$

The fact that this approximation of the initial condition is always possible from is mathematically proven by some version of the <spectral theorem> bsaed on the fact that <The Schrodinger equation Hamiltonian has to be Hermitian> and therefore behaves nicely.

It is interesting to note that solving the time-independent Schrodinger equation can also be seen exactly as an <eigenvalue> equation where:
* the <Hamiltonian> is a linear operator
* the value of the energy `E` is an <eigenvalue>
The only difference from usual <matrix> <eigenvectors> is that we are now dealing with an <infinite dimensional> vector space.

Furthermore:
* we immediately see from the equation that the time-independent solutions are states of deterministic energy because the energy is an <eigenvalue> of the Hamiltonian operator
* by looking at <equation Solution of the Schrodinger equation in terms of the time-independent and time dependent parts>{full}, it is obvious that if we take an energy measurement, the probability of each result never changes with time, because it is only multiplied by a constant

Quantum numbers appear directly in the <Schrödinger equation solution for the hydrogen atom>.

However, it very cool that they are actually discovered before the <Schrödinger equation>, and are present in the <Bohr model> (<principal quantum number>) and the <Bohr-Sommerfeld model> (<azimuthal quantum number> and <magnetic quantum number>) of the atom. This must be because they observed direct effects of those numbers in some experiments. TODO which experiments.

E.g. <The Quantum Story by Jim Baggott (2011)> page 34 mentions:
\Q[As the various lines in the spectrum were identified with different quantum jumps between different orbits, it was soon discovered that not all the possible jumps were appearing. Some lines were missing. For some reason certain jumps were forbidden. An elaborate scheme of ‘selection rules’ was established by Bohr and Sommerfeld to account for those jumps that were allowed and those that were forbidden.]
This refers to <forbidden mechanism>. TODO concrete example, ideally the first one to be noticed. How can you notice this if the energy depends only on the <principal quantum number>?

E.g. consider <gallium> which is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10 4p1:
* the electrons in <s-orbitals> such as 1s, 2d, and 3d are $l=0$, and so the only value for $m_l$ is 0
* the electrons in <p-orbitals> such as 2p, 3p and 4p are $l=1$, and so the possible values for $m_l$ are -1, 0 and 1
* the electrons in <d-orbitals> such as 2d are $l=2$, and so the possible values for $m_l$ are -2, -1, 0 and 1 and 2

The z component of the <quantum angular momentum> is simply:
$$
L_z = m_l \hbar
$$
so e.g. again for gallium:
* <s-orbitals>: necessarily have 0 z angular momentum
* <p-orbitals>: have either 0, $- \hbar$ or $+ \hbar$ z angular momentum

Note that this direction is arbitrary, since for a fixed <azimuthal quantum number> (and therefore fixed total angular momentum), we can only know one direction for sure. $z$ is normally used by convention.

The <principal quantum number> thing fully determining energy is only true for the <hydrogen emission spectrum> for which we can solve the <Schrodinger equation> explicitly.

For other atoms with more than one electron, the orbital names are just a very good approximation/perturbation, as we don't have an explicit solution. And the internal electrons do change energy levels.

However, orbitals energies for large atoms don't increase in energy like those of hydrogen due to <electron>-electron interactions.

{wiki}

This notation is so confusing! People often don't manage to explain the intuition behind it, why this is an useful notation. When you see Indian university entry exam level memorization classes about this, it makes you want to cry.

The key reason why term symbols matter are <Hund's rules>, which allow us to predict with some accuracy which <electron configurations> of those states has more energy than the other.

https://web.chem.ucsb.edu/~devries/chem218/Term%20symbols.pdf puts it well: <electron configuration notation> is not specific enough, as each such notation e.g. 1s2 2s2 2p2 contains several options of spins and z angular momentum. And those affect energy.

This is why those symbols are often used when talking about energy differences: they specify more precisely which levels you are talking about.

Basically, each term symbol appears to represent a group of possible electron configurations with a given <quantum angular momentum>.

We first fix the energy level by saying at which orbital each electron can be (<hyperfine structure> is ignored). It doesn't even have to be the ground state: we can make some electrons excited at will. 

The best thing to learn this is likely to draw out all the possible configurations explicitly, and then understand what is the term symbol for each possible configuration, see e.g. <term symbols for carbon ground state>.

It also confusing how uppercase letters S, P and D are used, when they do not refer to orbitals s, p and d, but rather to states which have the same angular momentum as individual electrons in those states.

It is also very confusing how extremelly close it looks to <spectroscopic notation>!

The form of the term symbol is:
$$
^{2S + 1}L_J
$$

The $2S + 1$ can be understood directly as the degeneracy, how many configurations we have in that state.

{parent=Term symbol}
{title2=1927}
{wiki}

Allow us to determine with good approximation in a multi-electron atom which <electron configuration> have more energy. It is a bit like the <Aufbau principle>, but at a finer resolution.

Note that this is not trivial since there is no explicit solution to the <Schrodinger equation> for multi-electron atoms <Schrödinger equation solution for the hydrogen atom>[like there is for hydrogen].

For example, consider carbon which has <electron configuration> 1s2 2s2 2p2.

If we were to populate the 3 <p orbitals> with two electrons with spins either up or down, which has more energy? E.g. of the following two:
``
m_L -1  0  1
    u_ u_ __
    u_ __ u_
    __ ud __
``

= Term symbols for carbon ground state
{parent=Solutions for the Schrodinger equation with multiple particles}

This example covered for example at <video Term Symbols Example 1 by TMP Chem (2015)}>.

<Carbon> has electronic structure 1s2 2s2 2p2.

For term symbols we only care about unfilled layers, because in every filled layer the total z angular momentum is 0, as one electron necessarily cancels out each other:
* <magnetic quantum number> varies from -l to +l, each with z angular momentum $-l \hbar$ to $+l \hbar$ and so each cancels the other out
* <spin quantum number> is either + or minus half, and so each pair of electron cancels the other out

So in this case, we only care about the 2 electrons in 2p2. Let's list out all possible ways in which the 2p2 electrons can be.

There are 3 p orbitals, with three different <magnetic quantum numbers>, each representing a different possible z <quantum angular momentum>.

We are going to distribute 2 electrons with 2 different spins across them. All the possible distributions that don't violate the <Pauli exclusion principle> are:

``
m_l  +1  0 -1  m_L  m_S
     u_ u_ __    1    1
     u_ __ u_    0    1
     __ u_ u_   -1    1
     d_ d_ __    1   -1
     d_ __ d_    0   -1
     __ d_ d_   -1   -1
     u_ d_ __    1    0
     d_ u_ __    1    0
     u_ __ d_    0    0
     d_ __ u_    0    0
     __ u_ d_   -1    0
     __ d_ u_   -1    0
     ud __ __    2    0
     __ ud __    0    0
     __ __ ud   -2    0
``

where:
* `m_l` is $m_l$, the <magnetic quantum number> of each electron. Remember that this gives a orbital (non-spin) <quantum angular momentum> of $m_l \hbar$ to each such electron
* `m_L` with a capital L is the sum of the $m_l$ of each electron
* `m_S` with a capital S is the sum of the spin angular momentum of each electron

For example, on the first line:
``
m_l  +1  0 -1  m_L  m_S
     u_ u_ __    1    1
``
we have:
* one electron with $m_l = +1$, and so angular momentum $\hbar$
* one electron with $m_l = +0$, and so angular momentum 0
and so the sum of them has angular momentum $0 + 1 \hbar = 1 \hbar$. So the value of $m_L$ is 1, we just omit the $\hbar$.

TODO now I don't understand the logic behind the next steps... I understand how to mechanically do them, but what do they mean? Can you determine the <term symbol> for individual microstates at all? Or do you have to group them to get the answer? Since there are multiple choices in some steps, it appears that you can't assign a specific term symbol to an individual microstate. And it has something to do with the <Slater determinant>. The previous lecture mentions it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_8n1TS-8Y0 more precisely https://youtu.be/7_8n1TS-8Y0?t=2268 about carbon.

https://youtu.be/DAgEmLWpYjs?t=2675 mentions that $^{3}D$ is not allowed because it would imply $L = 2, S = 1$, which would be a state `uu __ __` which violates the <Pauli exclusion principle>, and so was not listed on our list of 15 states.

He then goes for $^{1}D$ and mentions:
* S = 1 so $m_S$ can only be 0
* L = 2 (D) so $m_L$ ranges in -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
and so that corresponds to states on our list:
``
ud __ __    2    0
u_ d_ __    1    0
u_ __ d_    0    0
__ u_ d_   -1    0
__ __ ud   -2    0
``
Note that for some we had a two choices, so we just pick any one of them and tick them off off from the table, which now looks like:
``
 +1  0 -1  m_L  m_S
 u_ u_ __    1    1
 u_ __ u_    0    1
 __ u_ u_   -1    1
 d_ d_ __    1   -1
 d_ __ d_    0   -1
 __ d_ d_   -1   -1
 d_ u_ __    1    0
 d_ __ u_    0    0
 __ d_ u_   -1    0
 __ ud __    0    0
``

Then for $^{3}P$ the choices are:
* S = 2 so $m_S$ is either -1, 0  or 1
* L = 1 (P) so $m_L$ ranges in -1, 0, 1
so we have 9 possibilities for both together. We again verify that 9 such states are left matching those criteria, and tick them off, and so on.

For the $m_S$, we have two electrons with spin up. The angular momentum of each electron is $1/2 \hbar$, and so given that we have two, the total is $1 \hbar$, so again we omit $\hbar$ and $m_S$ is 1.

The wave equation contains the entire state of a particle.

From <mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics> remember that the wave equation is a vector in <Hilbert space>.

And a single vector can be represented in many different ways in different basis, and two of those ways happen to be the position and the momentum representations.

More importantly, position and momentum are first and foremost operators associated with observables: the <position operator> and the <momentum operator>. And both of their eigenvalue sets form a basis of the <Hilbert space> according to the <spectral theorem>.

When you represent a wave equation as a function, you have to say what the variable of the function means. And depending on weather you say "it means position" or "it means momentum", the position and momentum operators will be written differently.

This is well shown at: <video Visualization of Quantum Physics (Quantum Mechanics) by udiprod (2017)>.

Furthermore, the position and momentum representations are equivalent: one is the <Fourier transform> of the other: <position and momentum space>. Remember that notably we can always take the Fourier transform of a function in <l2> due to <Carleson's theorem>.

Then the uncertainty principle follows immediately from a general property of the Fourier transform: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fourier_transform&oldid=961707157#Uncertainty_principle

In precise terms, the <uncertainty principle> talks about the <standard deviation> of two measures.

We can visualize the uncertainty principle more intuitively by thinking of a <wave function> that is a <real number>[real] <flat top bump function> with a flat top in <1D>. We can then change the width of the support, but when we do that, the top goes higher to keep probability equal to 1. The momentum is 0 everywhere, except in the edges of the support. Then:
* to localize the wave in space at position 0 to reduce the space uncertainty, we have to reduce the support. However, doing so makes the momentum variation on the edges more and more important, as the slope will go up and down faster (higher top, and less x space for descent), leading to a larger variance (note that average momentum is still 0, due to to symmetry of the bump function)
* to localize the momentum as much as possible at 0, we can make the support wider and wider. This makes the bumps at the edges smaller and smaller. However, this also obviously delocalises the wave function more and more, increasing the variance of x

= Position and momentum space
{parent=Uncertainty principle}
{wiki}

One of the main reasons why physicists are obsessed by this topic is that position and momentum are mapped to the <phase space coordinates> of <Hamiltonian mechanics>, which appear in the <matrix mechanics> formulation of <quantum mechanics>, which offers insight into the theory, particularly when generalizing to <relativistic quantum mechanics>.

One way to think is: what is the definition of space space? It is a way to write the wave function $\psi_x(x)$ such that:
* the position operator is the multiplication by $x$
* the momentum operator is the derivative by $x$
And then, what is the definition of momentum space? It is of course a way to write the wave function $\psi_p(p)$ such that:
* the momentum operator is the multiplication by $p$

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/39442/intuitive-explanation-of-why-momentum-is-the-fourier-transform-variable-of-posit/39508#39508 gives the best idea intuitive idea: the <Fourier transform> writes a function as a (continuous) sum of plane waves, and each plane wave has a fixed momentum.

i.e., a function that takes the wavefunction as input, and outputs another function:

If you believe that <mathematicians> took care of <continuous spectrum (functional analysis)> for us and that everything just works, the most concrete and direct thing that this representation tells us is that:

Basically the operators are just analogous to the classical ones e.g. the classical:

$$
becomes:
$$
\hat{L}_z = -i \hbar \left( x\pdv{}{y} - y\pdv{}{x} \right)
$$

Besides the angular momentum in each direction, we also have the <total angular momentum>:
$$
\hat{L}^2 = \hat{L}_x + \hat{L}_y + \hat{L}_z
$$

Then you have to understand what each one of those does to the each <atomic orbital>:
* total angular momentum: determined by the <azimuthal quantum number>
* angular momentum in one direction ($z$ by convention): determined by the <magnetic quantum number>

There is an <uncertainty principle> between the x, y and z angular momentums, we can only measure one of them with certainty at a time. <video Quantum Mechanics 7a - Angular Momentum I by ViaScience (2013)> justifies this intuitively by mentioning that this is analogous to <precession>: if you try to measure electrons e.g. with the <Zeeman effect> the precess on the other directions which you end up modifing.

Relates particle momentum and its wavelength, or equivalently, energy and frequency.

The wavelength relation is:
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$
but since:
$$
v = \lambda f
E = p v
$$
the wavelength relation implies:
$$
\frac{v}{f} = \frac{h}{p}
f = \frac{v p}{h}  = \frac{E}{h}
$$

Particle wavelength can be for example measured very directly on a <double-slit experiment>.

So if we take for example electrons of different speeds, we should be able to see the diffraction pattern change accordingly.

It is apparently more closely related to the <ladder operator> method, which is a more <algebraic> than the more <analytical> <Schrödinger equation>.

It appears that this formulation makes the importance of the <Poisson bracket> clear, and explains why <physicists> are so obsessed with talking about <position and momentum space>.

Quantum superposition is really weird because it is fundamentally different than "either definite state but I don't know which", because the superposition state leads to different measurements than the non-superposition state.

Examples:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt8gVXDsh7Q "Interference in quantum mechanics" by <Looking Glass Universe> (2015) shows how a left-right <spin (physics)> measurement has a defined value for a superposed half up half down state, but not for a pure up state.

  TODO can this be conducted? As mentioned in the video, this is closely linked to the fact that you can describe the wave function in multiple different bases (up/down or left/right), which is also at the root of the <uncertainty principle>.
* <video Quantum Mechanics 9b - Photon Spin and Schrodinger's Cat II by ViaScience (2013)> gives a similar photon version
* it seems that the <single particle double slit experiment> can also be thought of as in terms of a superposition of "the particle goes through the right" and "the particle goes through the right", although it is a bit harder to thing about as it is not a <discrete> process

Quantum entanglement is often called spooky/surprising/unintuitive, but they key question is to understand why.

To understand that, you have to understand why it is fundamentally impossible for the entangled particle pair be in a predefined state <Bell test experiment>[according to experiments done] e.g. where one is deterministically yes and the other deterministically down.

In other words, why <local hidden-variable theory> is not valid.

How to generate entangled particles:
* <particle decay>, notably <pair production>
* for <photons>, notably: <spontaneous parametric down-conversion>, e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn1sEaw1K2k "Shanni Prutchi Construction of an Entangled Photon Source" by HACKADAY (2015). Estimatd price: 5000 USD.

{title=Bell's Theorem: The Quantum Venn Diagram Paradox by <minutephysics> (2017)}
{description=
Contains the clearest <Bell test experiment> description seen so far.

It clearly describes the <photon>-based 22.5, 45 degree/85%/15% probability <photon polarization> experiment and its result conceptually.

It does not mention <spontaneous parametric down-conversion> but that's what they likely hint at.

Done in Collaboration with <3Blue1Brown>.

{description=Gives a clear explanation of a thought <Bell test experiments> with <electron> <spin (physics)> of electron pairs from photon decay with three 120-degree separated slits. The downside is that he does not clearly describe an experimental setup, it is quite generic.}

{description=This only has two merits compared to <video Quantum Entanglement & Spooky Action at a Distance by Veritasium (2015)>: it mentions the Aspect et al. (1982) <Bell test experiment>, and it shows the continuous curve similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bell.svg[]. But it just does not clearly explain the bell test.}

{description=The hosts interview Professor Enrique Galvez of Colgate University who shows briefly the <optical table> setup without great details, and then moves to a whiteboard explanation. Treats the audience as stupid, doesn't say the keywords <spontaneous parametric down-conversion> and <Bell's theorem> which they clearly allude to. You can even them showing a two second footage of the professor explaining the rotation experiments and the data for it, but that's all you get.}

Basically a precise statement of "<quantum entanglement> is spooky".

Some of the most remarkable ones seem to be:
* Alain Aspect 1982
* Hensen et al., Giustina et al., Shalm et al. (2015): "<loopholes in Bell test experiments>[loophole]-free" Bell tests
