Quantum mechanics is quite a broad term. Perhaps it is best to start approaching it from the division into:
* <non relativistic quantum mechanics>: obviously the simpler one, and where you should start
* <relativistic quantum mechanics>: more advanced, and arguably "less useful"

Key experiments that could not work without quantum mechanics: <quantum mechanics experiment>{full}.

Mathematics: there are a few models of increasing precision which could all be called "quantum mechanics":
* <schrodinger equation>
* <dirac equation>
* <quantum electrodynamics>

<ciro santilli> feels that the <deep tech>[largest technological revolutions since the 1950's have been quantum related], and will continue to be for a while, from deeper understanding of chemistry and materials to <quantum computing>, understanding and controlling quantum systems is where the most interesting frontier of technology lies.

Atoms exist and last for a long time, while in <maxwell s equations>[classical electromagnetic theory punctual] orbiting electrons should emit radiation quickly and fall into the nucleus: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/20003/why-dont-electrons-crash-into-the-nuclei-they-orbit

= Atomic spectra
{synonym}

= Spectral line
{parent=emission-spectrum}
{wiki}

A single line in the <emission spectrum>.

So precise, so <discrete>, which makes no sense in <classical mechanics>!

Has been the leading motivation of the development of <quantum mechanics>, all the way from the:
* <schrodinger equation>: major lines predicted, including <zeeman effect>, but not finer line splits like <fine structure>
* <dirac equation>: explains <fine structure> 2p spin split due to electron spin/orbit interactions, but not <lamb shift>
* <quantum electrodynamics>: explains <lamb shift>
* <hyperfine structure>: due to electron/nucleus spin interactions, offers a window into <nuclear spin>

= NIST Atomic Spectra Database
{c}
{parent=spectral-line}

<nist> database for <spectral line>: https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html

Let's do a sanity check.

Searching for "H" for <hydrogen> leads to: https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ASD/lines1.pl?spectra=H&limits_type=0&low_w=&upp_w=&unit=1&submit=Retrieve+Data&de=0&format=0&line_out=0&en_unit=0&output=0&bibrefs=1&page_size=15&show_obs_wl=1&show_calc_wl=1&unc_out=1&order_out=0&max_low_enrg=&show_av=2&max_upp_enrg=&tsb_value=0&min_str=&A_out=0&intens_out=on&max_str=&allowed_out=1&forbid_out=1&min_accur=&min_intens=&conf_out=on&term_out=on&enrg_out=on&J_out=on

From there we can see for example the 1 to 2 lines:
* 1s to 2p: 121.5673644608 nm
* 1s to 2: 121.56701 nm TODO what does that $2$ mean?
* 1s to 2s: 121.5673123130200 TODO what does that mean?

We see that the table is sorted from lower from level first and then by upper level second.

So it is good to see that we are in the same 121nm ballpark as mentioned at <hydrogen spectral line>.

TODO why I can't see 2s to 2p transitions there to get the <fine structure>?

= Gross hydrogen emission spectrum
{parent=hydrogen-emission-spectrum}

One reasonable and memorable approximation excluding any <fine structure> is:
$$
E_n = -\frac{13.6eV}{n^2}
$$
{title=Hydrogen spectral series mnemonic}
see for example example: <hydrogen 1 2 spectral line>.

= Hydrogen 1-2 spectral line
{parent=gross-hydrogen-emission-spectrum}
{title2=121.6 nm}

<equation hydrogen spectral series mnemonic> gives for example from <principal quantum number> 1 to 2 a difference:
$$
E_n = -13.6eV\left[\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{1^2}\right] = 10.2eV
$$
which with <planck einstein relation> gives about 121.6 <nm> ($2.47 \times 10^15$ <hz>), which is a reasonable match with the value of 121.567... from the <nist atomic spectra database>.

Split in energy levels due to interaction between electron up or down <spin physics> and the electron orbitals.

= Hyperfine structure
{parent=fine-structure}
{wiki}

Small splits present in all levels due to interaction between the electron spin and the <nuclear spin> if it is present, i.e. the nucleus has an even number of nucleons.

As the name suggests, this energy split is very small, since the influence of the nucleus spin on the electron spin is relatively small compared to other <fine structure>.

For example, for the <hydrogen emission spectrum>:
* <hydrogen 1 2 spectral line>: 10.2eV

TODO confirm: does it need <quantum electrodynamics> or is the <dirac equation> enough?

Notable application: <caesium standard>, which is used to define the <second> in the <international system of units> since 1967.

= Zeeman effect
{c}
{parent=spectral-line}
{wiki}

Split in the <spectral line> when a <magnetic field> is applied.

Non-anomalous: number of splits matches predictions of the <schrodinger equation> about the number of possible states with a given angular momentum. TODO does it make numerical predictions?

<anomalous zeeman effect>[Anomalous]: evidence of <spin physics>.

http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~blackman/ast104/zeeman-split.html contains the hello world that everyone should know: 2p splits into 3 energy levels, so you see 3 spectral lines from 1s to 2p rather than just one.

p splits into 3, d into 5, f into 7 and so on, i.e. one for each possible <azimuthal quantum number>.

It also mentions that polarization effects become visible from this: each line is polarized in a different way. TODO more details as in an experiment to observe this.

{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

The discovery of the <photon> was one of the major initiators of quantum mechanics.

Light was very well known to be a wave through <diffraction> experiments. So how could it also be a particle???

This was a key development for people to eventually notice that the <electron> is also a wave.

This process "started" in 1900 with <planck s law> which was based on discrete energy packets being exchanged as exposed at <on the theory of the energy distribution law of the normal spectrum by max planck 1900>.

This ideas was reinforced by <einstein>'s explanation of the <photoelectric effect> in 1905 in terms of <photon>.

In the next big development was the <bohr model> in 1913, which supposed non-<classical physics> new quantization rules for the <electron> which explained the <hydrogen emission spectrum>. The quantization rule used made use of the <planck constant>, and so served an initial link between the emerging quantized nature of <light>, and that of the <electron>.

The final phase started in 1923, when <louis de broglie> proposed that in analogy to photons, <electrons> might also be waves, a statement made more precise through the <de broglie relations>.

This event opened the floodgates, and soon <matrix mechanics> was published in <quantum mechanical re interpretation of kinematic and mechanical relations by heisenberg 1925>, as the first coherent formulation of <quantum mechanics>.

It was followed by the <schrodinger equation> in 1926, which proposed an equivalent <partial differential equation> formulation to <matrix mechanics>, a mathematical formulation that was more familiar to <physicists> than the matrix ideas of Heisenberg.

<inward bound by abraham pais 1988> summarizes his views of the main developments of the subjectit:

= Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

These are the key mathematical ideas to understand!!

There are actually a few formulations out there. By far the dominant one as of 2020 has been the <schrodinger picture>, which contrasts notably with the <heisenberg picture>.

Another well known one is the <de broglie bohm theory>, which is deterministic, but <non local>.

= Schrödinger picture
{c}
{parent=mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics}

The state of a quantum system is a vector of unit length in a <hilbert space>. TODO why Hilbert Space.

"Making a measurement" for an <observable> means applying a <self adjoint operator> to the state, and after a measurement is done:
* the state <wave function collapse>[collapses] to an <eigenvector> of the self adjoint operator
* the result of the measurement is the <eigenvalue> of the self adjoint operator
* the probability of a given result happening when the spectrum is <discrete> is proportional to the modulus of the projection on that eigenvector.

  For continuous spectra such as that of the <position operator> in most systems, e.g. <schrodinger equation for a free one dimensional particle>, the projection on each individual eigenvalue is zero, i.e. the probability of one absolutely exact position is zero. To get a non-zero result, measurement has to be done on a continuous range of eigenvectors (e.g. for position: "is the particle present between x=0 and x=1?"), and you have to integrate the probability over the projection on a continuous range of eigenvalues.

  In such continuous cases, the probability collapses to an uniform distribution on the range after measurement.

  The continuous position operator case is well illustrated at: <video visualization of quantum physics quantum mechanics by udiprod 2017>
Those last two rules are also known as the <born rule>.

Self adjoint operators are chosen because they have the following key properties:
* their eigenvalues form an orthonormal basis
* they are diagonalizable

See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics

Perhaps the easiest case to understand this for is that of <spin physics>, which has only a finite number of eigenvalues. Although it is a shame that fully understanding that requires a <special relativity>[relativistic] quantum theory such as the <dirac equation>.

The next steps are to look at simple 1D bound states such as <particle in a box> and <quantum harmonic oscillator>.

This naturally generalizes to <schrodinger equation solution for the hydrogen atom>.

The solution to the <schrodinger equation for a free one dimensional particle> is a bit harder since the possible energies do not make up a <countable set>.

This formulation was apparently called more precisely <dirac von neumann axioms>, but it because so dominant we just call it "the" formulation.

<quantum field theory lecture notes by david tong 2007> mentions that:
\Q[if you were to write the wavefunction in quantum field theory, it would be a functional, that is a function of every possible configuration of the field $\phi$.]

= Bra-ket notation
{parent=mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics}
{wiki=Bra–ket_notation}

= Bra-ket
{synonym}

Notation used in <quantum mechanics>.

Ket is just a <vector mathematics>. Though generally in the context of <quantum mechanics>, this is an infinite dimensional vector in a <hilbert space> like <l2>.

Bra is just the <dual vector> corresponding to a ket, or in other words <projection mathematics> <linear operator>, i.e. a linear function which can act on a given vector and returns a single <complex number>. Also known as... <dot product>.

For example:
$$
(\bra{x}) \ket{y}
$$
is basically a fancy way of saying:
$$
x \cdot y
$$
that is: we are taking the projection of $y$ along the $x$ direction. Note that in the ordinary dot product notation however, we don't differentiate as clearly what is a vector and what is an operator, while the bra-ket notation makes it clear.

The projection operator is completely specified by the vector that we are projecting it on. This is why the bracket notation makes sense.

It also has the merit of clearly differentiating vectors from operators. E.g. it is not very clear in $x \cdot y$ that $x$ is an operator and $y$ is a vector, except due to the relative position to the dot. This is especially bad when we start manipulating operators by themselves without vectors.

This notation is widely used in <quantum mechanics> because calculating the <probability> of getting a certain outcome for an experiment is calculated by taking the projection of a state on one an <eigenvalue> basis vector as explained at: <mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics>{full}.

Making the projection operator "look like a thing" (the bra) is nice because we can add and multiply them much like we can for vectors (they also form a <vector space>), e.g.:
$$
\bra{x} + \bra{y}
$$
just means taking the projection along the $x + y$ direction.

<ciro santilli> thinks that this notation is a bit over-engineered. Notably the bra's are just vectors, which we should just write as usual with $\va{v}$... the bra thing makes it look scarier than it needs to be. And then we should just find a different notation for the projection part.

Maybe <dirac> chose it because of the appeal of the women's piece of clothing: <bra>, in an irresistible call from <british humour>.

But in any case, alas, we are now stuck with it.

Their most popular formulation has been the <schrodinger equation>.

{c}
{parent=non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

The <partial differential equation> of <special relativity>[non-relativistic] <quantum mechanics>.

Experiments explained:
* via the <schrodinger equation solution for the hydrogen atom> it predicts:
  * <spectral line> basic lines, plus <zeeman effect>
* <schrodinger equation solution for the helium atom>: perturbative solutions give good approximations to the energy levels
* <double slit experiment>: I think we have a closed solution for the max and min probabilities on the measurement wall, and they match experiments

Experiments not explained: those that the <dirac equation> explains like:
* <fine structure>
* <spontaneous emission> coefficients

To get some intuition on the equation on the consequences of the equation, have a look at:
* <schrodinger equation simulations>
* <solutions of the schrodinger equation>

The easiest to understand case of the equation which you must have in mind initially that of the <schrodinger equation for a free one dimensional particle>.

Then, with that in mind, the general form of the <schrodinger equation> is:
$$
i\hbar\pdv{\psi(\vv{x}, t)}{t} = \hat{H}[\psi(\vv{x}, t)]
$$
{title=Schrodinger equation}
where:
* $\hbar$ is the <reduced planck constant>
* $\psi$ is the <wave function>
* $t$ is the time
* $\hat{H}$ is a <linear operator> called the <hamiltonian>. It takes as input a function $\psi$, and returns another function. This plays a role analogous to the Hamiltonian in <classical mechanics>: determining it determines what the physical system looks like, and how the system evolves in time, because we can just plug it into the equation and solve it. It basically encodes the total energy and forces of the system.

The $\vv{x}$ argument of $\psi$ could be anything, e.g.:
* we could have preferred <polar coordinates> instead of linear ones if the potential were symmetric around a point
* we could have more than one particle, e.g. <solutions of the schrodinger equation for two electrons>, which would have e.g. $x_1$ and $x_2$ for different particles. No matter how many particles there are, we have just a single $\psi$, we just add more arguments to it.
* we could have even more generalized coordinates. This is much in the spirit of <hamiltonian mechanics> or <generalized coordinates>
Note however that there is always a single magical $t$ time variable. This is needed in particular because there is a time <partial derivative> in the equation, so there must be a corresponding time variable in the function. This makes the equation explicitly <non relativistic>.

The general <schrodinger equation> can be broken up into a trivial time-dependent and a <time independent schrodinger equation> by separation of variables. So in practice, all we need to solve is the slightly simpler <time independent schrodinger equation>, and the full equation comes out as a result.

= Time-independent Schrödinger equation
{parent=schrodinger-equation}
{wiki=Schrödinger_equation#Time-independent_equation}

The cool thing about the <Time independent Schrödinger equation> is that we can always reduce solving the full <schrodinger equation> to solving this slightly simpler time-independent version.

This is actually the approach that we will always take <solutions of the Schrodinger equation>[when solving the schrodinger equation], see e.g. <quantum harmonic oscillator>.

Before reading any further, you \i[must] understand <heat equation solution with Fourier series>, which uses <separation of variables>.

Once that example is clear, we see that the exact same <separation of variables> can be done to the <schrodinger equation>. If we name the constant of the separation of variables $E$ for energy, we get::
* a time-only part that does not depend on space and does not depend on the <hamiltonian> at all. The solution for this part is therefore always the same exponentials for any problem, and this part is therefore "boring":
  $$
  e^{-iEt/\hbar}
  $$
* a space-only part that does not depend on time, bud does depend on the hamiltonian:

  $$
  \hat{H}[\psi(\vv{x})] = E \psi{\vv{x}}
  $$
  {title=Time-independent Schrodinger equation}

  Since this is the only non-trivial part, unlike the time part which is trivial, this spacial part is just called "the time-independent Schrodinger equation".

  Note that the $\psi$ here is not the same as the $\psi$ in the <equation schrodinger equation>[time-dependent Schrodinger equation] of course, as that psi is the result of the multiplication of the time and space parts. This is a bit of imprecise terminology, but hey, physics.

Because the time part of the equation is always the same and always trivial to solve, all we have to do to actually solve the Schrodinger equation is to solve the time independent one, and then we can construct the full solution trivially.

Once we've solve the time-independent part, call it for each discrete energy $E_i$ as $E_i\psi_i(x)$, we proceed exactly as we did in <heat equation solution with Fourier series>: we make a weighted sum over all possible $E$ to match the initial condition, which is analogous to the <fourier series> in the case of the heat equation to reach a final full solution:
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-iEt/\hbar} E_i\psi_i(x)
$$
{title=Solution of the Schrodinger equation in terms of the time-independent and time dependent parts}
and this is a solution by selecting $E_i$ such that at time $t = 0$ we match the intial condition:
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{-iE0/\hbar} E_i\psi_i(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} E_i\psi_i(x) = initial condition
$$

The fact that this approximation of the initial condition is always possible from is mathematically proven by some version of the <spectral theorem> bsaed on the fact that <The Schrodinger equation Hamiltonian has to be Hermitian> and therefore behaves nicely.

It is interesting to note that solving the time-independent Schrodinger equation can also be seen exactly as an <eigenvalue> equation where:
* the <hamiltonian> is a linear operator
* the value of the energy `E` is an <eigenvalue>
The only difference from usual <matrix> <eigenvectors> is that we are now dealing with an <infinite dimensional> vector space.

Furthermore:
* we immediately see from the equation that the time-independent solutions are states of deterministic energy because the energy is an <eigenvalue> of the Hamiltonian operator
* by looking at <equation Solution of the Schrodinger equation in terms of the time independent and time dependent parts>{full}, it is obvious that if we take an energy measurement, the probability of each result never changes with time, because it is only multiplied by a constant

Quantum numbers appear directly in the <schrodinger equation solution for the hydrogen atom>.

However, it very cool that they are actually discovered before the the <schrodinger equation>, and are present in the <Bohr model> (<principal quantum number>) and the <Bohr Sommerfeld model> (<azimuthal quantum number> and <magnetic quantum number>) of the atom. This must be because they observed direct effects of those numbers in some experiments. TODO which experiments.

E.g. <The Quantum Story by Jim Baggott (2011)> page 34 mentions:
\Q[As the various lines in the spectrum were identiﬁed with different quantum jumps between different orbits, it was soon discovered that not all the possible jumps were appearing. Some lines were missing. For some reason certain jumps were forbidden. An elaborate scheme of ‘selection rules’ was established by Bohr and Sommerfeld to account for those jumps that were allowed and those that were forbidden.]

The wave equation contains the entire state of a particle.

From <mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics> remember that the wave equation is a vector in <hilbert space>.

And a single vector can be represented in many different ways in different basis, and two of those ways happen to be the position and the momentum representations.

More importantly, position and momentum are first and foremost operators associated with observables: the <position operator> and the <momentum operator>. And both of their eigenvalue sets form a basis of the <hilbert space> according to the <spectral theorem>.

When you represent a wave equation as a function, you have to say what the variable of the function means. And depending on weather you say "it means position" or "it means momentum", the position and momentum operators will be written differently.

This is well shown at: <video visualization of quantum physics quantum mechanics by udiprod 2017>.

Furthermore, the position and momentum representations are equivalent: one is the <fourier transform> of the other: <position and momentum space>. Remember that notably we can always take the Fourier transform of a function in <l2> due to <carleson s theorem>.

Then the uncertainty principle follows immediately from a general property of the Fourier transform: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fourier_transform&oldid=961707157#Uncertainty_principle

In precise terms, the <uncertainty principle> talks about the <standard deviation> of two measures.

We can visualize the uncertainty principle more intuitively by thinking of a <wave function> that is a <real number>[real] <flat top bump function> with a flat top in <1d>. We can then change the width of the support, but when we do that, the top goes higher to keep probability equal to 1. The momentum is 0 everywhere, except in the edges of the support. Then:
* to localize the wave in space at position 0 to reduce the space uncertainty, we have to reduce the support. However, doing so makes the momentum variation on the edges more and more important, as the slope will go up and down faster (higher top, and less x space for descent), leading to a larger variance (note that average momentum is still 0, due to to symmetry of the bump function)
* to localize the momentum as much as possible at 0, we can make the support wider and wider. This makes the bumps at the edges smaller and smaller. However, this also obviously delocalises the wave function more and more, increasing the variance of x

One of the main reasons why physicists are obsessed by this topic is that position and momentum are mapped to the <phase space coordinates> of <hamiltonian mechanics>, which appear in the <matrix mechanics> formulation of <quantum mechanics>, which offers insight into the theory, particularly when generalizing to <relativistic quantum mechanics>.

One way to think is: what is the definition of space space? It is a way to write the wave function $\psi_x(x)$ such that:
* the position operator is the multiplication by $x$
* the momentum operator is the derivative by $x$
And then, what is the definition of momentum space? It is of course a way to write the wave function $\psi_p(p)$ such that:
* the momentum operator is the multiplication by $p$

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/39442/intuitive-explanation-of-why-momentum-is-the-fourier-transform-variable-of-posit/39508#39508 gives the best idea intuitive idea: the <fourier transform> writes a function as a (continuous) sum of plane waves, and each plane wave has a fixed momentum.

{parent=position-and-momentum-space}
{wiki}

A way to write the wavefunction $\psi(x)$ such that the <position operator> is:
$$
x
$$
i.e., a function that takes the wavefunction as input, and outputs another function:
$$
x \psi(x)
$$

If you believe that <mathematicians> took care of <continuous spectrum functional analysis> for us and that everything just works, the most concrete and direct thing that this representation tells us is that:
\Q[the probability of finding a particle between $x_0$ and $x_1$ at time $t$]
equals:
$$
\int_{x_0}^{x_1}x \psi{x, t} dx
$$

This operator case is surprisingly not necessarily mathematically trivial to describe formally because you often end up getting into the <dirac delta functions>/continuous spectrum: as mentioned at: <mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics>

= Momentum operator
{parent=position-and-momentum-space}
{wiki}

One dimension in <position representation>:
$$
\hat{p} = - i \hbar \pdv{}{x}
$$

In three dimensions In position representation, we define it by using the <gradient>, and so we see that 
$$
\hat{p} = - i \hbar \pdv{}{x}
$$

{wiki}

Appears directly on <schrodinger equation>! And in particular in the <time independent schrodinger equation>.

= Time-energy uncertainty principle
{parent=energy-operator}

There is also a time-energy <uncertainty principle>, because those two operators are also <complementarity physics>[complementary].

= Angular momentum operator
{parent=uncertainty-principle}
{wiki}

Basically the operators are just analogous to the classical ones e.g. the classical:
$$
L_z = x p_y - y p_x
$$
becomes:
$$
\hat{L}_z = -i \hbar \left( x\pdv{}{y} - y\pdv{}{x} \right)
$$

Besides the angular momentum in each direction, we also have the <total angular momentum>:
$$
\hat{L}^2 = \hat{L}_x + \hat{L}_y + \hat{L}_z
$$

Then you have to understand what each one of those does to the each <atomic orbital>:
* total angular momentum: determined by the <azimuthal quantum number>
* angular momentum in one direction ($z$ by convention): determined by the <magnetic quantum number>

There is an <uncertainty principle> between the x, y and z angular momentums, we can only measure one of them with certainty at a time. <video quantum mechanics 7a angular momentum i by viascience 2013> justifies this intuitively by mentioning that this is analogous to <precession>: if you try to measure electrons e.g. with the <zeeman effect> the precess on the other directions which you end up modifing.

  That proof also mentions that if the potential `V` is not real, then there is no conservation of probability! Therefore the potential \i[must] be real valued!

This is in contrast to classical mechanics where e.g. the state of mechanical system is given by two real functions: position and speed.

The wave equation in <position representation> on the other hand encodes speed in "how fast does the complex phase spin around", and direction in "does it spin clockwise or counterclockwise", as described well at: <video visualization of quantum physics quantum mechanics by udiprod 2017>. Then once you understand that, it is more compact to just view those graphs with the phase color coded as in <video simulation of the time dependent schrodinger equation javascript animation by coding physics 2019>.

Relates particle momentum and its wavelength, or equivalently, energy and frequency.

The wavelength relation is:
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$
but since:
$$
v = \lambda f
E = p v
$$
the wavelength relation implies:
$$
\frac{v}{f} = \frac{h}{p}
f = \frac{v p}{h}  = \frac{E}{h}
$$

Particle wavelength can be for example measured very directly on a <double slit experiment>.

So if we take for example electrons of different speeds, we should be able to see the diffraction pattern change accordingly.

{wiki}

Published by <werner heisenberg> in 1925-07-25 as <quantum mechanical re interpretation of kinematic and mechanical relations by heisenberg 1925>, it offered the first general formulation of quantum mechanics.

It is apparently more closely related to the <ladder operator> method, which is a more <algebraic> than the more <analytical> <schrodinger equation>.

It appears that this formulation makes the importance of the <poisson bracket> clear, and explains why <physicists> are so obsessed with talking about <position and momentum space>. This point of view also apparently makes it clearer that <quantum mechanics> can be seen as a generalization of <classical mechanics> through the <hamiltonian>.

<qed and the men who made it dyson feynman schwinger and tomonaga by silvan schweber 1994> mentions however that <relativistic quantum mechanics> broke that analogy, because some 2x2 matrix had a different form, TODO find that again.

<inward bound by abraham pais 1988> chapter 12 "Quantum mechanics, an essay" part (c) "A chronology" has some ultra brief, but worthwhile mentions of matrix mechanics and the <commutator>.

{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki=Planck–Einstein_relation}

Photon energy is proportional to its frequency:
$$
energy = (plancks \space constant) * (frequency)
$$
or with common weird variables:
$$
E = h * \nu
$$

This only makes sense if the <photon> exists, there is no classical analogue, because the energy of classical waves depends only on their amplitude, not frequency.

Experiments that suggest this:
* <photoelectric effect>
* <compton scattering>

= Planck constant
{c}
{parent=planck-einstein-relation}
{title2=$h$}
{wiki}

Proportionality factor in the <planck einstein relation> between light energy and frequency.

And analogously for matter, appears in the <de broglie relations> relating momentum and frequency. Also appears in the <schrodinger equation>, basically as a consequence/cause of the de Broglie relations most likely.

Intuitively, the <planck constant> determines at what length scale do quantum effects start to show up for a given energy scale. It is because the Plank constant is very small that we don't perceive quantum effects on everyday energy/length/time scales. On the $\lim_{h \to 0}$, quantum mechanics disappears entirely.

A very direct way of thinking about it is to think about what would happen in a <double slit experiment>. TODO think more clearly what happens there.

= Quantum superposition
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

Quantum superposition is really weird because it is fundamentally different than "either definite state but I don't know which", because the superposition state leads to different measurements than the non-superposition state.

Examples:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt8gVXDsh7Q "Interference in quantum mechanics" by <looking glass universe> (2015) shows how a left-right <spin physics> measurement has a defined value for a superposed half up half down state, but not for a pure up state.

  TODO can this be conducted? As mentioned in the video, this is closely linked to the fact that you can describe the wave function in multiple different bases (up/down or left/right), which is also at the root of the <uncertainty principle>.
* <video quantum mechanics 9b photon spin and schrodinger s cat ii by viascience 2013> gives a similar photon version
* it seems that the <single particle double slit experiment> can also be thought of as in terms of a superposition of "the particle goes through the right" and "the particle goes through the right", although it is a bit harder to thing about as it is not a <discrete> process

= Entanglement
{synonym}

Quantum entanglement is often called spooky/surprising/unintuitive, but they key question is to understand why.

To understand that, you have to understand why it is fundamentally impossible for the entangled particle pair be in a predefined state <bell test experiment>[according to experiments done] e.g. where one is deterministically yes and the other deterministically down.

In other words, why <local hidden variable theory> is not valid.

How to generate entangled particles:
* <particle decay>, notably <pair production>
* for <photons>, notably: <spontaneous parametric down conversion>, e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn1sEaw1K2k "Shanni Prutchi Construction of an Entangled Photon Source" by HACKADAY (2015). Estimatd price: 5000 USD.
