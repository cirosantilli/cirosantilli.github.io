Therefore, perhaps "gifted education" is not the ideal name for this idea, as it generally implies very small N (1%?), while this project hopes for larger N, maybe 10%.

Either because you believe in the <a href="religion">soul</a>, or because your <a href="brain">built-in empathy behaviours</a>. If it is not a human, do whatever you want to it. Killing is already undoubtedly the greatest <a href="religion#sin">sin</a>. It is not OK to kill a human painlessly is it? So if torturing it brings humans good, then do it.</div><div class="p" id="_217">Of course, this does get use close and closer to "the what is a human" question, which is more relevant than ever in the <a href="ciro-santilli#molecular-biology-technologies">awakening of genetics</a>: all species are after all a continuum right?</div><div class="p" id="_218">And Ciro does not have a simple solution to this problem, besides that in 99.9999% the answer is obvious to 99.9999% of the people, and for the others cases, we have to do it like the law and make flawed rules to cover the remaining 0.000099999% cases and let juries decide the rest.</div><div class="p" id="_219">The only other sensible sacredness barrier is the common vegetarian "nervous systems are sacred" one. But how can you believe that if you also follow the religion of <a href="physics">physics</a>, where <a href="science#physics-and-the-illusion-of-life">everything is just made of atoms</a>?</div><div class="p" id="_220">Is it evil to take one neuron and torture it? What does that even mean? It will be fun when <a href="brain">pain and pleasure</a> are fully understood.</div><div class="p" id="_221">And you are going to have a really hard time when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa_in_Jainism">mosquitoes start transmitting deadly diseases that kill your family</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_222">Laws in most 2020 Western modern societies have converged to a hypocritical balance between not offending people too much by hiding the killing and minimizing the pain when possible at low cost. Killing animals painlessly is basically always fine if it brings any "non sadistic" pleasure to humans. And torturing animals is fine with approval e.g. to make medicines.</div><div class="p" id="_223">This has the downside of increasing costs for society. Maybe there are practical benefits besides people feeling bad about animals? Maybe we would have more serial killers if people were free to torture animals? Maybe people in butcher shops would become depressive if their bosses weren't forced to use more expensive painless killing methods? Neither of those seems like huge arguments though.</div><div class="p" id="_224">It eventually comes down to: "how much more is a human life worth than that of an animal" which brings <a href="religion#jesus">Jesus</a>'s <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-34&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 6:25-34 "Do Not Worry"</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190801221835/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-34&amp;version=NIV">archive</a>) quote to mind:<div><blockquote id="_225">Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?</blockquote></div></div><div class="p" id="_226">Non-vegetarian pets owners also baffle Ciro, as most of them basically extend the sacred human line further arbitrarily to certain other cute looking animals like dogs, cats or rabbits, but will gladly kill a cow indirectly by paying someone to pay someone to pay someone to cut it into small pieces. Or they believe that certain specific individuals are sacred. Admittedly, the latter is more rational, and looks a lot of how we treat our own families well, and can accept that other families are not doing so well.</div><div class="p" id="_227">Ciro's even more rational evil side says: the real reason why humans are sacred is a practical one: people have families that love them, and they come to kill you if you kill them, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Romeo_and_Juliet#Prince_Escalus">this starts endless chains of violence</a> that make society unbearable.</div><div class="p" id="_228">While animals feel pain when their children are killed, their memory and logic is just not good enough to fully understand that humans in general have an evil plot to it, and they don't have a method to communicate between themselves and fight back.</div><div class="p" id="_229">For similar reasons, Ciro is pro-abortion.</div><div class="p" id="_230"><a href="television-series#futurama">Futurama</a>'s S02E15 <a href="television-series#the-best-television-series">"The Problem With Popplers" episode</a> blew Ciro's mind so much.</div><div class="p" id="_231">Ciro should stop discussing topics in which infinite argument has already been had. Sometimes he writes things down so he can stop caring the next time the subject comes up, as there's no need to say it again once it is written.</div><div class="h" id="university-entry-quotas"><div class="notnav"><h2><a href="university-entry-quotas">University entry quotas</a></h2><span class="hover-meta"> <a class="split" href="university-entry-quotas"></a><span class="metrics"><span class="wcntr"> Words: 858</span></span></span></div><nav class="h-nav h-nav-toplevel"><div class="nav"><a href="" class="u"> Cirism</a><a href="#_toc/university-entry-quotas" class="toc"></a><a href="https://ourbigbook.com/cirosantilli/university-entry-quotas"><img src="_obb/logo.svg" class="logo" alt=""> OurBigBook.com</a></div></nav></div><div class="p" id="_232"><a href="ciro-santilli">Ciro Santilli</a> is against <a href="economy#affirmative-action">affirmative action</a> university entry quotas that reserve spaces e.g. for students from discriminated races or poor families. Instead, he believes that affirmative action should take place on earlier stages of education as described at: <a href="#free-gifted-education">free gifted education</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_233">Notably, <a href="brazil">Brazil</a> has implemented a very heavy university entry quota system <a href="ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-formal-education">after Ciro had left university there</a>: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23862676">www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23862676</a></div><div class="p" id="_234">This is of course easy for a white male from a privileged background to say, and infinite debate has already been had on this matter, but here goes again.</div><div class="p" id="_235">First, in defense to the personal attack, Ciro raises the fact that he has dedicated large chunks (all?) of his life to open source <a href="software#open-source-software">software</a> and knowledge in general, which Ciro believes is the only way to actually make the world fairer to poor countries. His money (time) is where his mouth is.</div><div class="p" id="_236">One good argument in favor of the <a href="brazil">Brazilian</a> quota system, is that the kids who enter university because of quotas <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0100-15742009000200014">do just as well as those who don't</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_237">Ciro has actually believes that this is possible, and offers the following possible explanation: <a href="ourbigbook-com#motivation">most of pre-university knowledge is useless, and university selection system is crap, and Ciro wants to destroy it with a system in which anyone can learn university stuff from home</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_238">Both the top end of the quota and non-quota kids are basically equally capable of doing useful stuff therefore.</div><div class="p" id="_239">Only a tiny fraction of what you learn in high school is useful for university or your career.</div><div class="p" id="_240">And possibly more importantly than knowledge, Ciro saw many of his colleagues (basically all of which were from relatively privileged backgrounds) "do badly" in university, because of lack of motivation, because they had chosen a course only to find that they were not interested in it because the existing <a href="how-to-teach#help-students-achieve-their-goal">high school educational system is crap and does not help them find what they love</a> and because it costs you <a href="#students-must-have-a-flexible-choice-of-what-to-learn">several years of your life to change your choice in most universities</a> (long live <a href="ecole-polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a>).</div><div class="p" id="_241">Maybe the fact that poor kids know that they are <a href="biology#sexual-intercourse">fucked</a> if they fail, and so they have to succeed at any cost, might also help with motivation. Which is a terrible terrible thing, because only those who have to leeway to take risks end up taking them and making the <a href="ciro-santilli#the-next-big-thing">the next big thing</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_242">Ciro believes instead that only once kids have learnt university level stuff in their area of interest <a href="ourbigbook-com#motivation">for free on the Internet</a> should they go through selection based on that specific and much more concentrated useful knowledge.</div><div class="p" id="_243">And this competition must only be used to distribute resources which you can't learn from <a href="biology#sexual-intercourse">fucking</a> computers:<div class="list"><ul id="_244"><li id="_245">laboratories. Actually, one of Ciro's most important advices to kids nowadays is: <a href="university#when-in-doubt-choose-the-course-that-has-the-most-experimental-work">when in doubt, choose the course that has the most experimental work</a></li><li id="_246"><a href="how-to-teach#talk-with-individuals-not-to-groups">one to one mentorship</a> on advanced master thesis/PhD level projects</li></ul></div></div><div class="p" id="_247">Once this point knowledge is reached however, it starts to become unclear if a single "everyone takes the same test to avoid discrimination" test is feasible anymore, and we start entering the much more relevant (and potentially discriminatory) "I am a teacher trying to advance the <a href="art#state-of-the-art">state of the art</a>, and I need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_having_ordinary_skill_in_the_art">a person mildly skilled in the art</a> to do some slave labor for me", which is PhDs selection work.</div><div class="p" id="_248">If quota are in place, what will happen is that parents of the rich kids will start investing less in education, and possibly just put their kids in high schools, and do home schooling instead. This would therefore reduce the total investments the country makes in education!</div><div class="p" id="_249">Outside of the obvious technical evolution proposed, Ciro is a huge proponent of <a href="#free-gifted-education">free gifted education</a>. Or closely related, creating scholarships that focus on poor students. The entry requirements should be the same, but once you qualify, everyone should have enough money to lead a decent life during their studies.</div><div class="p" id="_250">Then let those kids pass exactly the same university entry exams, and watch them crush the average privileged kids.</div><div class="p" id="_251">This advice is similar to what is mentioned at: <a href="what-poor-countries-have-to-do-to-get-richer">what poor countries have to do to get richer</a>. When you don't have money to do everything, you must select a few good bets and focus on them. You can't pay a lot to every public school teacher, so you must select a few select places that need it the most. As those smart bets pay off, you start to have more and more money to expand the system further.</div><div class="figure"><figure id="video-inside-westside-barbell-by-vice-news-2018" class="multiline"><div class="float-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AvHM7H_hh80?start=121" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><figcaption><a href="#video-inside-westside-barbell-by-vice-news-2018"><span class="caption-prefix">Video 5. </span></a><div class="title">Inside Westside Barbell by Vice News (2018)</div> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvHM7H_hh80">Source</a>. <div class="p" id="_252">One sentence of this nice documentary about the notorious Westside Barbell gym where the openly pro-performance-enhancing-drug powerlifting legend leader and <a href="religion#cult">cult</a>-leader-like personality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Simmons">Louis Simmons</a> teaches just stuck to <a href="ciro-santilli">Ciro Santilli</a>'s mind.

In its philosophy and organization, Uni resembled the Dewey School. The students were accelerated as much as possible to keep lessons challenging. One goal was to "introduce pupils to high school methods and subjects before they reached the 9th grade." The fourth quarter, offered during the summer, allowed students who had missed work or had fallen behind to catch up.

By the time John had turned fifteen and Bill seventeen, the two had completed every course of interest at Madison Central. There was no longer any reason to postpone entering college.
