In this first year I improved project tech, but didn't go and solve university courses to create super targeted content, and didn't obtain a single contributing user except myself, see a summary at <a href="updates#ourbigbook-project-update-march-2024">Section "OurBigBook Project Update March 2024"</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_4">For a followup, it would be an interesting experiment to spend on year full time solving as many courses as I can from a world class university in the city where I live in the UK, and adding that as content to the platform to see if that would attract interest, and reaching out directly to course takers at their university environment to try and help them. I intended to do that in year one but my got distracted by tech. It is quite possible that no one has ever done that before in history: a highly motivated technical person with the time and opportunity to do one single thing: help top university students learn their STEM courses better and have more fun doing so. I have in particular identified one course where this would be particularly feasible: the mathematics course, given that much of their course materials, and also their building are quite open. I do sometimes wonder if doing this would be just a waste of my life. But part of me tells me it could generate big interest and is worth a try. It would also be fun for you to watch me continue to commit career seppuku.</div><div class="p" id="_5">For a second follow up year, I increased my requirement to 300k USD to give me more peace of mind.

If you want to donate in crypto, and clearly give me your real identity and an explanation of how you got the money, then that is fine, it can count. Just be warned that I will need to give that information to my bank and clear it with them beforehand, and if they are still not happy with it, I'll just give it all back.

Other experiences and ideas that contribute to this realization are:<div class="list"><ul id="1000-monero-donation/_146"><li id="1000-monero-donation/_147">the creation of the <a href="https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#ourbigbook-com-fellowship">OurBigBook Fellowship</a>, which as of writing consisted of a single donation. During this exercise, <a href="ciro-santilli">Ciro Santilli</a> gave about 2k USD to help a promising Brazilian student. In doing so, he understood a lot about what goes on inside a "rich person's" head when considering a donation<div class="list"><ul id="1000-monero-donation/_148"><li id="1000-monero-donation/_149">it is hard to decide who to donate to and find those people. In part because as soon as you create a public donation system with an application process, people will game the fuck out of it. Perhaps the <a href="amazon#lost-horse-llc">Lost Horse LLC</a> approach of "they find you" is the best?</li><li id="1000-monero-donation/_150">it is basically impossible to donate more than 1% of your net worth if you have a family.

First a private 150 USD by an awesome sponsor. Then the 2023-09 ~810$ <a href="cryptocurrency#bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> one. Finally came the 2023-11-20 100 Monero one. And it was that one that pushed Ciro to start his "100k USD = 1 year campaign".</div><div class="p" id="1000-monero-donation/_153">Finally on 2024-03-13, Ciro received an anonymous 10 <a href="cryptocurrency#monero">Monero</a> donation to self-custody wallet. He had clearly stated that one should make a test donation to that wallet before the big one, so 10 Monero felt like it could be the test one. Ciro communicated the reception at: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cirosantilli/112112988286298258">mastodon.social/@cirosantilli/112112988286298258</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1769464788009066710">twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1769464788009066710</a>:</div><div><blockquote id="1000-monero-donation/_154">I cashed out 10 XMR on @<a href="cryptocurrency#agoradesk">AgoraDesk</a> for ~1,375 USD, and kept some change in the wallet for fun.

He was feeling particularly bored and a bit sad with his work life that night. And there it was. 1000 Monero on the wallet.

But he managed. Further notes on that at: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/17arz9f/converting_xmr_to_gbp_in_the_uk/">www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/17arz9f/converting_xmr_to_gbp_in_the_uk/</a>. Ciro also decided to keep about 200 Monero around just for fun as a crazy moonshot.</div><div class="p" id="1000-monero-donation/_157">Another major factor likely Ciro having published his article: <a href="cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain">Section "Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain"</a> in 2019. This is something he wrote entirely for fun during an intense 3 week side-time binge in 2019, though some large updates were made later on. It was this article that likely some crypto-dude attention to <a href="ciro-santilli">Ciro Santilli</a>'s profile. As of 2024, there is said to be about 20 crypto billionaires, so perhaps there are about 2000 crypto 10 millionaires<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90949038/bitcoin-price-billionaires-list-crypto-wealth-2023"><sup class="ref">[ref]</sup></a>, which is the minimum net worth for a donation of 100k USD to be feasible (1% mark). And perhaps a reasonable number of them are just nerds who got rich, and want to improve the world. There are two lessons from this:<div class="list"><ul id="1000-monero-donation/_158"><li id="1000-monero-donation/_159">follow your instincts, always. If something seems mega fun and quick, do it!</li><li id="1000-monero-donation/_160">making money from a few rich people (or entities like organizations) is easier than working for a bunch of poor people, because you have to convince less people. If you reach many poor people however, things are much more stable as you can lose a few customers and still be fine</li></ul></div></div><div class="p" id="1000-monero-donation/_161">Another factor in the donation, <a href="ciro-santilli">Ciro Santilli</a> believes, is that many rich people thing that education is bullshit. <a href="brain#many-successful-people-are-neurodiverse">Many successful people are neurodiverse</a> and as such, it is only natural that a large number of rich people want to improve our educational system, which tends to be the very epitome of "boring and average normality" which <a href="ciro-santilli">Ciro Santilli</a> so much detests.

id="1000-monero-donation/_248">On the 28th of July 2025, Barclays finally replied with a hopefully final (who knows, everything is such a mess with this process):<div><blockquote id="1000-monero-donation/_249">Following a review of the above account, we have identified large value crypto assets with unknown sources. If such activity continues, keeping this account open poses a risk that we might breach laws or regulations. We therefore request that such payments are halted and, if the transactions repeat, we will take action to close this account with immediate notice. In the event of any closure, you will be required to repay any overdraft or other borrowing on the account. </blockquote></div>So <a href="ciro-santilli">Ciro Santilli</a> gets to keep his account and the anonymous ~80k cashed out to it, but he cannot receive further anonymous donations on it.</div><div class="p" id="1000-monero-donation/_250">As an outcome of this, I've also had to update my donation guidelines to not count anonymous donations towards my goals.</div><div class="p" id="1000-monero-donation/_251">Barclays regulation felt so sloppy that I'm sure that with some effort to essentially launder the money, e.g. cashing out smaller amounts across various accounts, which I explicitly did not do in part to test the system, I would have gotten away with it, or large part of it.
