Check out: \b[https://OurBigBook.com], the best way to publish your scientific knowledge. It's an <open source> <note taking system> that can publish from <lightweight markup> files in your computer both to a multi-user \b[<mind melding>] dynamic website, or as a <static website>. It's like \b[<Wikipedia> + <GitHub> + <Stack Overflow> + <Obsidian (software)> mashed up]. Source code: \b[https://github.com/ourbigbook/ourbigbook].

<sponsor>[Sponsor me to work on this project]. For \b[200k <USD>] I will quit my job or not get a new job and work on <OurBigBook> full time for a second year to try and kickstart \b[The Higher Education Revolution]. Status: \b[~44k / 200k USD]. At \b[2M USD] I retire/tenure and work on open STEM forever. How to donate: <sponsor>{full}.

I first quit my job 1st June 2024 to work on the project for 1 year after I reached my initial 100k goal mostly via a <sponsor/1000 Monero donation>. For a second follow up year, I increased my requirement to 200k USD to give me more peace of mind. So the total donation so far is \b[144k], and if I reach a total of \b[300k USD], then I'll work on the project for a second year. A second year greatly improve chances of success: year one I improved my tech, year two I come guns blazing to solve courses and expand further.

\b[Mission]: to live in a world where you can learn <university>-level <mathematics>, <physics>, <chemistry>, <biology> and <engineering> from perfect free <open source> books that anyone can write to get famous. More rationale: <OurBigBook.com>{full}

<Ciro Santilli's documentation superpowers>[Explaining things is my superpower], e.g. I was top user \#39 on <Stack Overflow> in 2023https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/year/stackoverflow/2023-01-01{ref}<Ciro Santilli's Stack Overflow contributions>{ref} and I have a few 1k+ star educational <GitHub> repositorieshttps://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat{ref}<Linux Kernel Module Cheat>{ref}https://github.com/cirosantilli/x86-bare-metal-examples{ref}https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=user%3Acirosantilli&s=stars&type=Repositories{ref}. Now I want to bring that level of awesomeness to <Master's degree>[masters level] <Mathematics> and <Physics>. But I can't do it alone! So I created <OurBigBook.com> to allow everyone to work together towards the perfect book of everything.

My life's goal is to bring hardcore <university>-level <STEM> <open educational content> to all ages. Sponsor me at https://github.com/sponsors/cirosantilli[] starting from 1<Dollar>[\$]/month so I can work full time on it. Further information: <sponsor>{full}. Achieving what I call "<free gifted education>" is my <Nirvana>.

Besides that, I'm also a <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[freedom of speech] <slacktivist> and <Ciro Santilli's cycling>[recreational cyclist]. I like <Chinese traditional music> and classic <Brazilian pop>. Opinions are my own, but they could be yours too. <Tax the rich>.

Let's <the ideal university>[create an educational system] with:
* no distinction between <university> and <high school>, <students must have a flexible choice of what to learn>[students just go as fast as they can to what they really want] without stupid <university entry exams>
* <OurBigBook.com>[fully open source learning material]
* <exam as a service>[on-demand examinations that anyone can easily take without prerequisites]
* <the only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories>[granular entry selection only for space in specific laboratories] or participation in specific <novel research> projects

\b[I offer]:
* online private tutoring for:
  * any <STEM> university course
  * passionate younger <STEM> students (any age) who want to learn university level material and beyond. Can your kid be the next <Fields Medalist> or <Nobel Prize> winner? I'm here to help, especially if you are filthy rich! I focus <Students must be allowed to progress as fast as they want>[moving students forward as fast as they want] on and on <how to teach/Projects must aim for novelty>[producing useful novel tutorials and results]

  Let <Emile, or On Education>[your child be my Emile], and me be their <Adolfo Amidei>, and let's see how far they can go! I will help take your child:
  * into the best <universities>
  * into the best <PhD> programs
  and achieve their ambitious <STEM> goals!
* educational consulting for institutions looking to improve their <STEM> courses
  * do you know \i[that] course or teacher that consistently gets bad reviews every year? I'll work with the teacher to turn the problem around!
  * are you looking to create a consistent <open educational resources> offering to increase your institutions internationally visibility? I can help with that too.

My approach is to:
* propose interesting research projects. The starting point is always deciding the end goal: <backward design>{full}
* learn what is needed to do the project together with the student(s)
* publish any novel results or tutorials/tools produced <freely licensed> online, and encourage the student to do the same (<how to teach/Let students learn by teaching>{full}, <digital garden>)
For minors, parents are welcome to join video calls, and all interactions with the student will be recorded and made available to parents.

I have <articles>[a proven track of explaining complex concepts in an interesting and useful way]. I work for the learner. Teaching statement at: <How to teach>{full}. Pricing to be discussed. Contact details at: <How to contact Ciro Santilli>{full}.

I am particularly excited about pointing people to the potential <next big things>, my top picks these days are:
* <quantum computing>
* <AGI research>, in particular <AI code generation>, <automated theorem proving> and <robotics>
* assorted <molecular biology technologies>
I am also generally interested in:
* 20th century physics, notably <AMO> and <condensed matter>
* the <history of science>, and in particular <there is value in tutorials written by early pioneers of the field>[trying to look at seminal papers of a field]

{title=`YellowRobot.jpg`}
{disambiguate=index}
{description=
<JPG> image fully embedded in the <Bitcoin blockchain> depicting some kind of cut material art depicting a yellow robot, <inscription (blockchain)>[inscribed] on https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/4cbb32cd27b5b5edc12d3559bdffc1355ac2a210463d5cfaadc7ce9b06675b2b[January 29, 2017].

<Ciro Santilli> found this image and others during his research for <Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain>{full} by searching for image fingerprints on every transaction payload of the blockchain with a script.

The image was uploaded by <EMBII>, co-creator of the <Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain/AtomSea & EMBII> upload mechanism, which was responsible for a large part of the image <inscription (blockchain)>[inscriptions] in the <Bitcoin blockchain>.

The associated message reads:
> Chiharu \[<EMBII>'s Japanese wife\] and I found this little yellow robot while exploring Chicago. It will be covered by tar or eventually removed but this tribute will remain. N 41.880778 E -87.629210
This is one of <Ciro Santilli>'s favorite AtomSea & EMBII uploads, as it perfectly encapsules the "medium as an art form" approach to blockchain art, where even non-novel works can be recontextualized into something interesting, here depicting an opposition between the ephemeral and the immutable.

At https://twitter.com/EMBII4U/status/1615389973343268871 <EMBII> announced that he would be giving off shares of that image on <Sup!? (Bitcoin-based social media)>, a <Bitcoin>-backed <NFT> system he was; making. In December 2023, he gave some shares of the robot to <Ciro Santilli>.

This is another website that was used as one of the <CIA 2010 covert communication websites>. This website is written in <Brazilian Portuguese>, and therefore suggests that the <CIA> had assets in <Brazil> at the time, and thus was spying on a "fellow democracy".

Although <Snowden>'s revelations made it extremely obvious to the world that the USA spies upon everyone outside of the <Five Eyes>, including fellow democracies, it is rare to have such a direct a concrete proof of it visible live right on the <Wayback Machine>.
