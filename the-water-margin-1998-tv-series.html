The best part of it is the backstory of <a href="china#water-margin-character">individual characters</a>, and how noble men are made fight their government. As things progress however, it becomes more of a mass battles thing, so less interesting. This is perhaps a problem of the novel itself, which an adaption cannot avoid. The good part basically ends with the end of Wu Song's story at episode 22.</div><div class="p" id="_192">One of the most amazing things about this series is learning about how people lived in the past. It feels very realistic. Some amazing details:<div class="list"><ul id="_193"><li id="_194">on the pharmacy, they used a leg powered grinder. <a href="ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-wife">Ciro Santilli's wife</a> said she had actually seen one those in use in China</li><li id="_195">to indicate that something is for sale, the would attach some straws around it</li><li id="_196">it is totally fine to talk to an old person about giving them money to buy a nice coffin</li><li id="_197">some dudes drink <a href="china#baijiu">baijiu</a> from bowls.

He is bounced again, and finally accepted as assistant to a wealthy household. The actor and the way Gao Qiu is portrayed is very subtle. Makes you almost like him or feel sorry for him. Good job.</li><li id="_212">while delivering two small jade statues to a wealthy friend of his current master, he stumbles upon the friend playing <a href="china#cuju">cuju</a> with some attendants, and shows off his incredible abilities. The friend soon asks his current master to give him over, and the old master complies.</li><li id="_213">the new master much appreciates Gao Qiu because of his playing. Gao Qiu's old gang of misfits comes looking for him, and he invites them to restaurant the next day. But at the restaurant, he menaces his old friends who adore him, saying that they must never try to find him again. Gao then orders his men to beat the old friends with sticks. He asks the men to not beat the old friend who adored him the most so as to look as if he were an accomplice with Gao, and the other old friends then beat him up as well themselves.</li><li id="_214">Gao's new master becomes the emperor for some reason. The new master, now emperor, then also promotes Gao, of whom he is very fond of, to a very high military rank for which he has no qualifications. Want Jin learns of this as Gao will now be his boss, and foreseeing trouble asks for fake sick leave on the first day that Gao will be there.</li><li id="_215">Upon learning about the sick leave, Gao remembers Wang Jin, and calls him in regardless, and orders his men to beat him severely with sticks as a punishment for faking to be sick. An advisor pleads him to stop as that would look bad in his first day in charge.</li><li id="_216">while Wang Jin's mother nurses him to recovery, they decide that it is best if they escape to another city to avoid Gao's persecution. Wang Jin the flees carrying his mother on a wheeled cart. Upon learning of this, Gao orders Wang to be arrested for leaving his post. The <a href="literature#shirtless-scene">shirtless scene</a> in which Wang is treated by his mother shows how physically prepared the actor was, well done.

Shi Jin's story is told properly in chapter 2 and 3 of the novel according to Wikipedia, before Lu's own story is told on chapters 3-7, but this adaptation skips it.</div><div class="p" id="_224">While they are talking, there is some lady crying nearby, and Zhishen ends up helping her out. She had been deceived by the butcher Zheng, and now ows him money and cannot leave town.</div><div class="p" id="_225">Butcher Zheng is a ruthless fellow, one amazing scene shows him throwing a knife at a dog that was stealing some of his meat, and telling his men to skin the dog so they can eat it, saying:<div><blockquote id="_226">You eat from me for free, so I eat from you for free!</blockquote></div>in Chinese:<div><blockquote id="_227">你白吃我，我白吃你！</blockquote></div></div><div class="p" id="_228">Next morning, Shi Jin leaves whil Zhishen is sleeping his drunkenness off, and when Zhishen wakes up he goes to escort the damsel out of town. When he arrives, Lu's hotel keeper underling is causing trouble, and he slaps him hard and forces him to massage his legs while the lady can escape.</div><div class="p" id="_229">After that, he pays butcher Zheng a visit. First he pisses Zheng off by making an order of 5 kg of lean minced meat. Minced meat was produced by cutting it up with two meat cleavers, a rather tiring job Ciro's <a href="ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-mother-in-law">mother in law sometimes</a> did that when there was no pork mince but there was a piece of pork laying around, can you believe it!</div><div class="p" id="_230">Lu then asks Zheng to produce 5 kg of minced fatty, a weird request, but to which Zheng complies, causing him much effort.</div><div class="p" id="_231">Lu then finally asks for 5 kg of minced bones! Zheng understands that Lu is not trying to buy from him, and a fight ensues, in which Lu soon kills Zheng with his bare fists, and then escapes to avoid justice.</div><div class="p" id="_232">Lu ends up finding the damsel he had helped earlier in another town, and she's doing fine as the concubine of a wealthy man, who then helps him become a monk to avoid justice, but entering a monastery to which the man had donated money.</div></li><li id="_233">3 Lu can't follow the monastery rules, notably not drinking alcohol and not eating meat, and gets kicked out, sent to find work in another monastery at the Capital</li></ul></div></li><li id="_234"><a href="china#lin-chong">Lin Chong</a><div class="list"><ul id="_235"><li id="_236">4 Lu arrives at the new monastery at the capital and is assigned to take care of the vegetable garden that was being pilfered, which he does well. In a remarkable scene, he shows his might to the thieves by <a href="china#lu-zhishen-uproots-willow-tree">uprooting a willow three</a>. Later on, while demonstrating his fighting skills to his new acquired followers, <a href="china#lin-chong">Lin Chong</a> is passing by and takes notice. The two fight a few rounds to measure each others strengths and are impressed by one another.</li><li id="_237">5 The magistrate, possibly after some bribing, does not dare accuse Lin of attempting murder, which would mean the death sentence. So he reduces it to 20 beatings with a stick and banishment to TODO Chang something. They then plan to kill him on the way and make it look like an accident.</li><li id="_238">6 On the way to prison which is in another town, while crossing a forest, the two underlings attempt to murder <a href="china#lin-chong">Lin Chong</a>, but <a href="china#lu-zhishen-saves-lin-chong">Lu Zhishen appears and saves him</a>.<br>He intimidates the men by breaking a tree with his staff, Lu really has something against trees it seems. Lin Chong decides to still go to prison so as to not become a fugitive, and arrives safely in prison.</li><li id="_239">7 Men from the capital are sent to the prison to kill Lin Chong. They transfer him to a barn, and try to set the barn on fire, but Lin Chong happens to be staying at a small nearby temple in which he made an offer to the Gods of the mountain. The killers then come by to take cover, and Lin Chong murders them with his spear, thus sealing his fate as a fugitive forever. The killing is represented in this painting: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yoshitoshi-Lin_Chong.jpg">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Yoshitoshi-Lin_Chong.jpg</a></li><li id="_240">8 Lu's followers lure Gao Qiu's adopted son into a trap, and cut off his genitals. Lin Chong goes to Mount Liang marsh. He head of the bandit group there does not want to take him in afraid that he will steal his leadership post, but his second in commands badly want Lin Chong to stay, recognizing his worth. The leader asks him to kill someone to prove his commitment, but Lin refuses to kill innocent people. Still, ends up staying having nowhere else to go. At the end, the <a href="china#yang-zhi-water-margin">Yang Zhi</a>, the Blue Faced Demon, passes by the Mount Liang marsh. Je has just lost a stone shipment for the Emperor's <a href="china#chinese-garden">stone garden</a> due to a storm while he was on boat. The garden is a useless pursuit directly supervised by Gao Qiu.</li></ul></div></li><li id="_241">Chao Gai and the original 7:<div class="list"><ul id="_242"><li id="_243"><div class="p" id="_244">9 The Blue faced demon returns to the capital. He tries to bribe bribe Gao Qiu for forgiveness for losing the stones, but it fails and he is thrown into jail. He is then forced to use all his money to bribe his way out of jail, and after leaving has to sell his precious family inherited sword to eat. A local bully who often eats merchants food without paying, because he has connection to corrupt officials, asks to see the sword. Although the does not appear serious about buying, the Blue faced demon displays it to him and the crowd. The incredible sword can:<div class="list"><ul id="_245"><li id="_246">cut <a href="chemistry#copper">copper</a> without denting. He demonstrates this on some copper coins</li><li id="_247">cut a hair placed on it by simply blowing the hairs</li><li id="_248">cut through a man without being stained by blood</li></ul></div>In order to demonstrate the cutting of a man, the demon asks for someone to bring a dog, but the bully keeps insisting that a man must be used. When he starts to get physical, the demon kills the bully by semi-accident with the sword. After being cut and just before dying, the bully recognizes that the sword is truly a magnificent weapon.</div><div class="p" id="_249">The demon turns himself in for the killing, but because it was a semi accident with many witnesses to support him, all of which hated the bully, he is exiled to another city rather than put to death. Upon arriving in the new city, the governor of the new city seems happy to have him as a great warrior and releases him and gives him a good reception, having him demonstrate his weapon skills to court.</div></li><li id="_250"><div class="p" id="_251">10 The Blue faced demon is tasked by his new master with delivering some expensive birthday gifts from the new city to the capital, a dangerous task. He proposes transporting the gifts as ordinary goods in cheap looking packages to divert the attention of thieves.</div><div class="p" id="_252">The scene then cuts to the Red Haired Devil and other men plan to steal the gifts, which is morally justified because they are being sent from one corrupt official to another. The leader of the group of thieves dreams about the <a href="astronomy#big-dipper">Big Dipper</a> and the number of stars coincides with the number of accomplices that ends up forming somewhat by chance. The band makes a formal oath to their goal and intentions, in which they burning papers (presumably with written promises) and drink <a href="china#baijiu">baijiu</a> ritually.

She later finds the letter from Chai Gai which would implicate Song Jiang with the bandits. She tries to bribe Song Jiang into fucking her, only then will she give the letter back, but Song Jiang is not happy with that, and instead pulls out a knife, and in the struggle kills her by semi accident.
