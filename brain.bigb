There are two ways:
* manually dumping your brain on <media> such as notebooks, <wikis> or videos, i.e. forming a <personal knowledge base>
* technically using sensors for <brain scanning>

<Wikipedia> defines <Mind uploading> as a synonym for <whole brain emulation>. This sounds really weird, as "mind uploading" suggests much more simply <brain dumping>, or perhaps reuploading a brain dump to a brain.

<Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom (2014)> section "Whole brain emulation" provides a reasonable setup: post mortem, take a brain, freeze it, then cut it into fine slices with a <Microtome>, and then inspect slices with an <electron microscope> after some kind of staining to determine all the synapses.

Likely implies <AGI>.

In the 2020's, this refers to writing down everything you know, usually in some graph structured way.

This is somewhat the centerpiece of <Ciro Santilli's documentation superpowers>: dumping your brain into text form, which he has been doing through <Ciro Santilli's website>.

This is also the closest one can get to immortality pre full blown <transhumanism>.

Ciro's still looking for the restore this plaintext backup on a new body though.

It is a good question, how much of your knowledge you would be able to give to others with text and images. It is likely almost all of it, except for coordination/signal processing tasks.

His passion for <braindumping> like this is a big motivation behind <Ciro Santilli>'s <OurBigBook.com> work.

= Connectome
{parent=Brain}
{tag=Omics}
{wiki}

= Connectome scale
{parent=Connectome}

A <Drosophila melanogaster> has about 135k <neurons>, and we only managed to reconstruct its connectome in 2023.

The human brain <Number of neurons in the human brain>[has 86 billion neurons], about 1 million times more. Therefore, it is obvious that we are very very far away from a full connectome.

Instead however, we could look at larger scales of connectome, and then try from that to extract modules, and then reverse engineer things module by module.

This is likely how we are going to "understand how the human brain works".

Some notable conectomes:
* 2019: 1mm cube of <mouse brain>: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02208-0
* 2023: <Drosophila connectome>

= Milimiter resolution connectome
{parent=Connectome}

= Microscopy connectome extraction
{parent=Connectome}
{tag=Brain reading}

= Post mortem connectome extraction with microtome
{synonym}

This is the most plausible way of obtaining a full <connectome> looking from 2020 forward. Then you'd observe the slices with an <electron microscope> + appropriate <Staining>. <Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom (2014)> really opened <Ciro Santilli>'s eyes to this possibility.

Once this is done for a <human>, it will be one of the greatest milestone of humanities, coparable perhaps to the <Human Genome Project>. BUt of course, privacy issues are incrediby pressing in this case, even more than in the human genome project, as we would essentially be able to read the brain of the person after their death.

As of 2022, the <Drosophila connectome> had been almost fully extracted.

This is also a possible path towards post-mortem <brain reading>.
