{title2}

Theoretical framework on which quantum field theories are based, theories based on framework include:
* <quantum electrodynamics>
* <quantum chromodynamics>
so basically the entire <standard model>

The basic idea is that there is a field for each particle particle type.

E.g. in QED, one for the <electron> and one for the <photon>: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/166709/are-electron-fields-and-photon-fields-part-of-the-same-field-in-qed[].

And then those fields interact with some <lagrangian>.

One way to look at QFT is to split it into two parts:
* deriving the Lagrangians of the <standard model>: <why do symmetries such as su 3 su 2 and u 1 matter in particle physics>. This is the easier part, since the lagrangians themselves can be understood with not very advanced mathematics, and derived beautifully from symmetry constraints
* the qantization of fields. This is the hard part <ciro santilli> is unable to understand, TODO <mathematical formulation of quantum field theory>.
Then interwined with those two is the part "OK, how to solve the equations, if they are solvable at all", which is an open problem: <yang mills existence and mass gap>.

There appear to be two main equivalent formulations of quantum field theory:
* <second quantization>
* <path integral formulation>

TODO holy crap, even this is hard to understand/find a clear definition of.

The <dirac equation>, OK, is a <partial differential equation>, so we can easily understand its definition with basic calculus. We may not be able to solve it efficiently, but at least we understand it.

But what the heck is the mathematical model for a quantum field theory? TODO someone was saying it is equivalent to an infinite set of PDEs somehow. Investigate. Related:

The <path integral formulation> might actually be the most understandable formulation, as shown at <richard feynman quantum electrodynamics lecture at university of auckland 1979>.

The formulation of QFT also appears to be a form of infinite-dimentional calculus.

<quantum electrodynamics by lifshitz et al 2nd edition 1982> chapter 1. "The uncertainty principle in the relativistic case" contains an interesting idea:
\Q[
The foregoing discussion suggests that the theory will not consider the time dependence of particle interaction processes. It will show that in these processes there are no characteristics precisely definable (even within the usual limitations of quantum mechanics); the description of such a process as occurring in the course of time is therefore just as unreal as the classical paths are in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The only observable quantities are the properties (momenta,
polarizations) of free particles: the initial particles which come into interaction, and the final particles which result from the process.

{parent=mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-field-theory}

The term and idea was first introduced initialized by <hermann weyl> when he was working on combining <electromagnetism> and <general relativity> to formulate <maxwell s equations in curved spacetime> in 1918 and published as <gravity and electricity by hermann weyl 1918>. Based on perception that <u 1> symmetry implies <charge conservation>. The same idea was later adapted for <quantum electrodynamics>, a context in which is has even more impact.

{wiki}

https://www.quora.com/How-are-quantum-fields-quantized-to-describe-particles

Second quantization also appears to be useful not only for <relativistic quantum mechanics>, but also for <condensed matter physics>. The reason is that the basis idea is to use the number occupation basis. This basis is:
* convenient for <quantum field theory> because of <particle creation and annihilation> changes the number of particles all the time
* convenient for <condensed matter physics> because there you have a gazillion particles occupying entire <electronic band theory>[energy bands]

{wiki}

This one might actually be understandable! It is what <richard feynman> starts to explain at: <richard feynman quantum electrodynamics lecture at university of auckland 1979>.

The difficulty is then proving that the total probability remains at 1, and maybe causality is hard too.

The path integral formulation can be seen as a generalization of the <double slit experiment> to infinitely many slits.

Feynman first stared working it out for <non relativistic quantum mechanics>, with the relativistic goal in mind, and only later on he attained the relativistic goal.

TODO why intuitively did he take that approach? Likely is makes it easier to add <special relativity>.

This approach more directly suggests the idea that <quantum particles take all possible paths>.

  <quantum field theory lecture by tobias osborne 2017/lecture 3> properly defines a <local symmetry> in terms of the context of the <lagrangian density>, and explains that the conservation of currents there is basically the statement of <noether s theorem> in that context.

Theory that describes <electrons> and <photons> really well, and <richard feynman quantum electrodynamics lecture at university of auckland 1979>[as Feynman puts it] "accounts very precisely for all physical phenomena we have ever observed, except for gravity and nuclear physics" ("including the laughter of the crowd" ;-)).

Learning it is one of <ciro santilli>'s main intellectual <fetishes>.

While Ciro acknowledges that QED is intrinsically challenging due to the wide range or requirements (<quantum mechanics>, <special relativity> and <electromagnetism>), Ciro feels that there is a glaring gap in this moneyless market for a learning material that follows the <middle way> as mentioned at: <the missing link between basic and advanced>. <richard feynman quantum electrodynamics lecture at university of auckland 1979> is one of the best attempts so far, but it falls a bit too close to the superficial side of things, if only Feynman hadn't assumed that the audience doesn't know any mathematics...

The funny thing is that when <ciro santilli s mother> retired, learning it (or as she put it: "how photons and electrons interact") was also one of her retirement plans. She is a pharmacist by training, and doesn't know much <mathematics>, and her <english language> was <having more than one natural language is bad for the world>[somewhat limited]. Oh, she also wanted to learn how <photosynthesis> works (possibly not fully understood by science as that time, 2020). Ambitious old lady!!!

Experiments: <quantum electrodynamics experiments>.

Combines <special relativity> with more classical <quantum mechanics>, but further generalizing the <dirac equation>, which also does that: <dirac equation vs quantum electrodynamics>.

Before QED, the most advanced theory was that of the <dirac equation>, which was already relativistic but TODO what was missing there exactly?

As summarized at: https://youtube.com/watch?v=_AZdvtf6hPU?t=305[] Quantum Field Theory lecture at the African Summer Theory Institute 1 of 4 by Anthony Zee (2004):
* classical mechanics describes large and slow objects
* special relativity describes large and fast objects (they are getting close to the speed of light, so we have to consider relativity)
* classical <quantum mechanics> describes small and slow objects.
* QED describes objects that are both small and fast

That video also mentions the interesting idea that:
* in special relativity, we have the <mass energy equivalence>
* in quantum mechanics, thinking along the <time energy uncertainty principle>, $\Delta E \sim \frac{1}{\Delta t}$
Therefore, for small timescales, energy can vary a lot. But mass is equivalent to energy. Therefore, for small time scale, particles can appear and disappear wildly.

QED is the first <quantum field theory> fully developed. That framework was later extended to also include the <weak interaction> and <strong interaction>. As a result, it is perhaps easier to just <google> for "Quantum Field Theory" if you want to learn QED, since QFT is more general and has more resources available generally.

Like in more general quantum field theory, there is on field for each particle type. In quantum field theory, there are only two fields to worry about:
* <photon> field
* <electromagnetism> field

where:
* $F$ is the <electromagnetic tensor>

Note that this is the sum of the:
* <dirac lagrangian>, which  only describes the "inertia of bodies" part of the equation
* the <electromagnetic> interaction term ${1 \over 4\mu_0} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}$, which describes term describes forces
Note that the relationship between $\psi$ and $F$ is not explicit. However, if we knew what type of particle we were talking about, e.g. <electron>, then the knowledge of <psi> would also give the charge distribution and therefore $F$

* add the <u 1> <internal symmetry> to add interactions, which reaches the full equation

{title=Deriving the <qed lagrangian> by <dietterich labs> (2018)}
{description=
As mentioned at the start of the video, he starts with the <dirac equation> Lagrangian derived in a previous video. It has nothing to do with <electromagnetism> specifically.

He notes that that <dirac lagrangian>, besides being globally <lorentz invariant>, it also also has a global <u 1> invariance.

However, it does not have a local invariance if the <u 1> transformation depends on the point in spacetime.

He doesn't mention it, but I think this is highly desirable, because in general <local symmetries of the lagrangian imply conserved currents>, and in this case we want conservation of charges.

To fix that, he adds an extra <gauge field> $A_\mu$ (a field of $4 \times 4$ matrices) to the regular derivative, and the resulting derivative has a fancy name: the <covariant derivative>.

Then finally he notes that this <gauge field> he had to add has to transform exactly like the <electromagnetic four potential>!

So he uses that as the gauge, and also adds in the <maxwell lagrangian> in the same go. It is kind of a guess, but it is a natural guess, and it turns out to be correct.

= What does it mean that photons are force carriers for electromagnetism?
{parent=quantum-electrodynamics}

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/61095/photon-as-the-carrier-of-the-electromagnetic-force

TODO find/create decent answer.

I think the best answer is something along:
* <local symmetries of the lagrangian imply conserved currents>. $U(1)$ gives conserved charges.
* OK now. We want a local $U(1)$ symmetry. And we also want:
  * <dirac equation>: quantum relativistic Newton's laws that specify what forces do to the fields
  * <electromagnetism>: specifies what causes forces based on currents. But not what it does to masses.
  Given all of that, the most obvious and direct thing we reach a guess at the <quantum electrodynamics lagrangian> is <video deriving the qed lagrangian by dietterich labs 2018>

A basic non-precise intuition is that a good model of reality is that electrons do not "interact with one another directly via the electromagnetic field".

A better model happens to be the <quantum field theory> view that the electromagnetic field interacts with the photon field but not directly with itself, and then the photon field interacts with parts of the electromagnetic field further away.

The more precise statement is that the <photon field> is a gauge field of the electromagnetic force under local U(1) symmetry, which is described by a <lie group>. TODO understand.

This idea was first applied in <general relativity>, where <einstein> understood that the "force of <gravity>" can be understood just in terms of symmetry and curvature of space. This was later applied o <quantum electrodynamics> and the entire <standard model>.

From <video lorenzo sadun on the yang mills and mass gap millennium problem>:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCQ9GIqpGBI&t=1663s mentions this idea first came about from <hermann weyl>.
* https://youtu.be/pCQ9GIqpGBI?t=2827 mentions that in that case the curvature is given by the <electromagnetic tensor>.

Talk title shown on intro: "Today's Answers to Newton's Queries about Light".

6 hour lecture, where he tries to explain it to an audience that does not know any modern physics. This is a noble effort.

Part of The Douglas Robb Memorial Lectures lecture series.

Feynman apparently also made a book adaptation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED:_The_Strange_Theory_of_Light_and_Matter[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]. That book is basically word by word the same as the presentation, including the diagrams.

According to http://www.feynman.com/science/qed-lectures-in-new-zealand/ the official upload is at http://www.vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8[] and Vega does show up as a watermark on the video (though it is too pixilated to guess without knowing it), a project that has been discontinued and has has a non-permissive license. Newbs.

4 parts:
* Part 1: is saying "<photons> exist"
* Part 2: is amazing, and describes how photons move as a sum of all possible paths, not sure if it is relativistic at all though, and suggests that something is minimized in that calculation (the <action physics>)
* Part 3: is where he hopelessly tries to explain the crucial part of how electrons join the picture in a similar manner to how photons do.

  He does make the link to light, saying that there is a function $P(A, B)$ which gives the amplitude for a photon going from A to B, where A and B are spacetime events.

  And then he mentions that there is a similar function $E(A, B)$ for an electron to go from A to B, but says that that function is too complicated, and gives no intuition unlike the photon one.

  He does not mention it, but P and E are the so called <propagators>.

  This is likely the <path integral formulation> of QED.

  On <quantum mechanical view of reality by richard feynman 1983> he mentions that $E$ is a <bessel function>, without giving further detail.

  And also mentions that:
  $$
  E = f(1, 2, m) \\
  P = f(1, 2, 0)
  $$
  where `m` is basically a scale factor.
  such that both are very similar. And that something similar holds for many other particles.

  And then, when you draw a <feynman diagram>, e.g. electron emits photon and both are detected at given positions, you sum over all the possibilities, each amplitude is given by:
  $$
  c \times E(A, D) \times E(D, B) \times P(B, C)
  $$
  summed over all possible $D$ <spacetime> points.

  This is basically well said at: https://youtu.be/rZvgGekvHes?t=3349 from <quantum mechanical view of reality by richard feynman 1983>.

  TODO: how do electron velocities affect where they are likely to end up? $E(A, D)$ suggests the probability only depends on the spacetime points.

  Also, this clarifies why computations in QED are so insane: you have to sum over every possible point in space!!! TODO but then how do we calculate anything at all in practice?
* Part 4: known problems with QED and thoughts on QCD. Boring.
This talk has the merit of being very experiment oriented on part 2, big kudos: <how to teach and learn physics>

Basically the same content as: <richard feynman quantum electrodynamics lecture at university of auckland 1979>, but maybe there is some merit to this talk, as it is a bit more direct in some points. This is consistent with what is mentioned at http://www.feynman.com/science/qed-lectures-in-new-zealand/ that the Auckland lecture was the first attempt.

Some more information at: https://iucat.iu.edu/iub/5327621

By Mill Valley, CA based producer "Sound Photosynthesis", some info on their website: http://sound.photosynthesis.com/Richard_Feynman.html

They are mostly a <new age> production company it seems, which highlights Feynman's absolute cult status. E.g. on the last video, he's not wearing shoes, like a proper guru.

Feynman liked to meet all kinds of weird people, and at some point he got interested in the <new age> <esalen institute>. <surely you re joking mr feynman> this kind of experience a bit, there was nude bathing on a pool that oversaw the sea, and a guy offered to give a massage to the he nude girl and the accepted.

https://youtu.be/rZvgGekvHest=5105 actually talks about <spin physics>, notably that the endpoint events also have a spin, and that the transition rules take spin into account by rotating thing, and that the transition rules take spin into account by rotating things.

{wiki}

= Weak force
{synonym}

Explains <beta decay>. TODO why/how.

Maybe a good view of why this force was needed given <beta decay> experiments is: in beta decay, a <neutron> is getting split up into an <electron> and a <proton>. Therefore, those charges must be contained inside the neutron somehow to start with. But then what could possibly make a positive and a negative particle separate?
* the <electromagnetic force> should hold them together
* the <strong force> seems to hold positive charges together. Could it then be pushing opposite-charges apart? Why not?
* <gravity> is too weak

http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/Weak-nuclear-force.html gives a quick and dirty:
\Q[Beta decay could not be explained by the strong nuclear force, the force that's responsible for holding the atomic nucleus together, because this force doesn't affect electrons. It couldn't be explained by the electromagnetic force, because this does not affect <neutrons>, and the force of <gravity> is far too weak to be responsible. Since this new atomic force was not as strong as the strong nuclear force, it was dubbed the weak nuclear force.]
Also interesting:
\Q[While the photon 'carries' charge, and therefore mediates the <electromagnetic force>, the <z boson>[Z] and <w boson>[W] <bosons> are said to carry a property known as 'weak isospin'. <w bosons> mediate the weak force when particles with charge are involved, and <z bosons> mediate the weak force when neutral particles are involved.]

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/106392/internal-and-spacetime-symmetries

The different only shows up for <field physics>, not with particles. For fields, there are two types of changes that we can make that can keep the <lagrangian> unchanged as mentioned at <physics from symmetry by jakob schwichtenberg 2015> chapter "4.5.2 Noether's Theorem for Field Theories - Spacetime":
* <spacetime symmetry>: act with the <poincare group> on the <four vector> spacetime inputs of the field itself, i.e. transforming $L(\Phi(x), \partial \Phi(x), dx)$ into $L(\Phi'(x'), \partial \Phi'(x'), x')$
* <internal symmetry>: act on the output of the  field, i.e.: $L(\Phi(x) + \delta \Phi(x), \partial (\Phi(x) + \delta \Phi(x)), x)$

From <defining properties of elementary particles>:
* spacetime:
  * <mass>
  * <spin physics>
* internal
  * <electric charge>
  * <weak charge>
  * <color charge>

From the spacetime theory alone, we can derive the <lagrangian> for the free theories for each <spin physics>:
* <spin 0>: <klein gordon equation>
* <spin half>: <dirac equation>
* <spin 1>: <proca equation>
Then the internal symmetries are what add the interaction part of the <lagrangian>, which then completes the <standard model lagrangian>.

Don't redistribute clause, and final version by Cambridge University Press, alas, so corrections will never be merged back: http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html[]. But at least he's collecing erratas for the published (and therefore draft) versions there.

The book is top-level organized in spin 0, spin half, and spin 1. Quite ominous, really.

The preface states that one of its pedagogical philosophies is to "Illustration of the basic concepts with the simplest examples.", so maybe there is hope after all.

* quantum scalar field. Covers <bosons>, and is simpler to get intuition about.
* quantum Dirac field. Covers <fermions>
* interacting fields
* <perturbation theory>
* <renormalization>

Non-relativistic <qft> is a limit of relativistic QFT, and can be used to describe for example <condensed matter physics> systems at very low temperature. But it is still very hard to make accurate measurements even in those experiments.

Defines "relativistic" as: "the <lagrangian> is symmetric under the <poincare group>".

Mentions that "QFT is hard" because (a finite list follows???):
\Q[There are no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary <representation theory>[representations] of the <poincare group>.]
But I guess that if you fully understand what that means precisely, QTF won't be too hard for you!

Notably, this is stark contrast with rotation symmetry groups (<special orthogonal group>[SO(3)]) which appears in space rotations present in <non relativistic quantum mechanics>.

Followup to <quantum field theory lecture by tobias osborne 2017>.

When the word "advanced" precedes QFT, you know that the brainrape is imminent!!!

Big goal: explain the <standard model>.

This book really tries to recall basic things to ensure that the reader will be able to understand the more advanced ones.

Sometimes it goes a little bit overboard, like defining what a <function> does several times.

But <ciro santilli> really prefers it when authors error on the side of obvious.

People are mostly saying you have to be a more of a genius amateur to read it.

<quantum field theory lecture by tobias osborne 2017/lecture 1> mentions that this book is quick and dirty, as one might guess from the title. <ciro santilli> thinks he's gonna like this one.

First edition: from 2003, https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691010196[], ISBN-13: 978-0691010199.

= Quantum Field Theory Demystified by David McMahon (2008)
{parent=quantum-field-theory-book}

This didn't really deliver. It does start from the basics, but it is often hard to link those basics to more interesting or deeper points. Also like many other <quantum field theory book>, it does not seem to contain a single comparison between a theoretical result and an experiment.

= An Introduction To Quantum Field Theory by Peskin and Schroeder (1995)
{parent=quantum-field-theory-book}

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Frontiers-Physics/dp/0201503972

This is very widely used in courses as of 2020, it became kind of the default book.

Unfortunately, this approach bores <ciro santilli> to death. Or perhaps is too <the missing link between basic and advanced>[just advanced for him to appreciate]. Either of those.

800+ pages.
