This is a list of cool stuff found using techniques mentioned at: <how to extract data from the Bitcoin blockchain>{full}. Notably, <Ciro Santilli> developed his own set of scripts at https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids to find some of this data. This article was originally based on data analyzed going up to around block 668k (2021).

If you are loaded and like this article, consider dropping some coins at: 3KRk7f2JgekF6x7QBqPHdZ3pPDuMdY3eWR to support some much needed higher educational reform: <sponsor>{full}.

<Hidden surprises in the Bitcoin blockchain by Ken Shirriff (2014)> is a mandatory precursor to this article, and potentially contains some of the most interesting examples already. An attempt is made to not repeat stuff that is already said in that article. Some repetition happened by accident, as we explored and only later noticed it was already mentioned there. But this also managed to add some new aspects to points previously covered by Ken. This analysis is also a bit more data oriented through our scripting. And there are somethings that only showed up after that post was originally written in 2014, this one being originally written in 2021.

<Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[China stuff] is mentioned at: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/bitcoin-blockchain[].

As of 2023:
* this type of cool data had converged to the name "<inscription (blockchain)>", as seen e.g. at: <ordinal ruleset inscriptions>
* the study or "early" inscriptions had been called a form of "archeology" e.g. at: https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html

It is really cool to see people treating the Bitcoin blockchain basically like a global social media feed!

Cool stuff in other sections:

These can be viewed at https://bitcoinstrings.com/blk00052.txt[] and are mostly commented on the "Wikileaks cablegate data" section of <Hidden surprises in the Bitcoin blockchain by Ken Shirriff (2014)>.

Soon after block 229991 uploaded the <Satoshi uploader>, several interesting files were added to the blockchain using the uploader, and notably some containing content that might be <illegal> in certain <countries>, as a test to see if this type of content would make the Bitcoin blockchain illegal or not:

The announced filename is `cablegate-201012041811.7z`. As mentioned in <Hidden surprises in the Bitcoin blockchain by Ken Shirriff (2014)>, it has an ASCII list of several other transactions, which presumably when downloaded with the <Satoshi uploader> can concatenated lead to the full 7z file. Also as mentioned by Ken, it is infinitely easier for the average user to just access the cables directly on <WikiLeaks> :-) The data is preceded by the message:
  ``

These can be viewed at: https://bitcoinstrings.com/blk00052.txt[]. Not reproduced here because we are cowards.

So basically, this was the first obviously illegal block attempt.

None of this content is particularly eye-popping for <Ciro Santilli>'s slightly crazy <freedom of speech> standards, and as of 2021, the Bitcoin blockchain likely hasn't become illegal anywhere yet due to freedom of speech concerns.

Furthermore, it is likely much easier to find much worse illegal content by browsing any <uncensored Onion service search engine> for 2 minutes.

<Ciro Santilli> estimates that perhaps the uploader didn't upload <child pornography>, which is basically the apex of illegality of this era, because they were afraid that their identities would one day be found.

  \Q[skillfully regulating the order of the day]

Tribute to <computer security researcher> <Len Sassaman>, who killed himself on 2011-07-03, starting with an <ASCII art> portrait followed by text.

Because it comes so early in the blockchain, and because it is the first ASCII art on the blochain as far as we can see, and because is so well done, this is by far the most visible ASCII art of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Present at https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/out/0138.txt#L2[tx 930a2114cdaa86e1fac46d15c74e81c09eee1d4150ff9d48e76cb0697d8e1d72]. It does not show well on <bitcoin-strings-with-txids> however with rationale described at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/tree/3f53e152ec9bb0d070dbcb8f9249d92f89effa70#smart-newline-joining

But it can be seen at on <bitcoinStrings.com> at: https://bitcoinstrings.com/blk00003.txt[].

Transaction: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/930a2114cdaa86e1fac46d15c74e81c09eee1d4150ff9d48e76cb0697d8e1d72 from 2011-07-30, a few weeks after the suicide.

Discussion: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3370/in-which-block-was-len-sassaman-memorialised/101276#101276

Created by famous <computer security researcher> <Dan Kaminsky> and Travis Goodspeed, presumably https://twitter.com/travisgoodspeed[this other security researcher], evidence:
* signature on the tribute
* the art is highlighted at <video Black OPS of TCP IP by Dan Kaminsky (2011)>, which happened very few days after the art was uploaded to the blockchain, thus making it exceedingly unlikely that someone else could have done it

"Bernanke" is a reference to <Ben Bernanke>, who was one of the <economists> in power in the <US Government> during the <financial crisis of 2007-2008>, and much criticized by some, as shown for example in the documentary <Inside Job (2010)>. As hinted in the <Genesis block message>, the <United States Government> bailed out many big banks that were going to go bankrupt with taxpayer money, even though it was precisly those banks that had started the crisis through their reckless investment, thus violating principles of the free market and business accountability. This was one of the motivations for the creation Bitcoin, which could reduce government power over economic policy.

It is worth mentioning that there do exist some slightly earlier "artistic" <inscription (blockchain)>[inscriptions] in the form <Punycode inscription> in the <Namecoin> blockchain, but as far as we've seen, the are all trivial compared to `BitLen` in terms of artistic value/size.

From the JSON transaction we understand the encoding format:
``

      {

So it is really encoded one line at a time in the `script` of the transaction outputs.

</ASCII art> of a https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413591[Force of Will], a famous and powerful <Magic: The Gathering> card first printed in 1996.

This is <Ciro Santilli>'s personal favorite ASCII art he has found in the blockchain so far. Also Ciro could not find any other previous source of this, so there is some chance it is original. One can dream.

The choice of card is probably linked to the function of the card in the game of <Magic: The Gathering>. This card essentially prevents the opponent from casting a spell they are about to cast. The presumed intended meaning of this art is further accentuated by the https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/rules-interrupted-2002-07-03[old card type term "interrupt" (late renamed to "instant")], which suggests that "this ASCII art is an interruption to the normal monetary transactions of the blockchain".

One of also reminded of the <prayer wars> interruption attempts. We could not however identify anything specific that this ASCII art might have tried to interrupt besides the normal flow of monetary transactions.

If one goes full art critic mode, it is also tempting to draw a parallel between the card's "You may pay 1 life" alternative casting cost (as opposed to 5 mana, 3 and two blue, which is a very large cost for most games) as being a reference to the money spent by the uploader of the art to upload it.

TODO understand exactly how it was encoded and why it is so weird. The `UUUU` has a slightly weird encoding which we fixed by hand here TODO understand.

suggest this ASCII art might have been uploaded by <image Erich Erstu>, AKA Hyena, creator of <cryptograffiti.info>, a service which would have allowed uploading ASCII content to the blockchain.

The only other mention of "Duriel" in the blockchain is https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/out/0364.txt#L572[tx 140562ceb42fc8943fa52ccc0ddbb11ca2d88dae9b5240d7a4b46864538c515a] which has some freedom of speech comments and gives the email:

{description=
A bitcoin logo on https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/123573[block 123573] (2011-05-13).

This is the very first ASCII string to show up at https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids after only the <Genesis block message>.

This version of the image was just ripped from <Hidden surprises in the Bitcoin blockchain by Ken Shirriff (2014)>.

Reconstructing it should likely be a simple matter of copy pasting the ASCII <yEnc> encoding present in the two transactions from https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/out/0123.txt#L11[tx ceb1a7fb57ef8b75ac59b56dd859d5cb3ab5c31168aa55eb3819cd5ddbd3d806] into a text file and decoding the <yEnc>, but after searching for 20 minutes Ciro couldn't find a working yEnc decoder on <Ubuntu 21.10>. How can a format be so dead, even after considerable extensive use in the <Usenet>??? It makes you think about life.

As mentioned by Ken, the logo is split across two transactions: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/ceb1a7fb57ef8b75ac59b56dd859d5cb3ab5c31168aa55eb3819cd5ddbd3d806[ceb1a7fb57ef8b75ac59b56dd859d5cb3ab5c31168aa55eb3819cd5ddbd3d806] and 9173744691ac25f3cd94f35d4fc0e0a2b9d1ab17b4fe562acc07660552f95518.

There appears to be nothing strictly linking the two transactions, besides that they are very close by and the only ASCII strings around back in those pre-infinite-spam days, as can be seen at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/out/0123.txt#L11[], so you could just see both of them by eye.

Also the first one starts with:
``
=ybegin line=128 size=8776 name=bitcoin.jpg
``
and the second one ends in:
``
=yend size=8776 crc32=a7ac8449
``
so this is likely clearly part of the yEnc format for someone who knows it, and the filename `bitcoin.jpg` gives the file format.

They are not even in the same block:
* https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/ceb1a7fb57ef8b75ac59b56dd859d5cb3ab5c31168aa55eb3819cd5ddbd3d806 is in block 123573
* https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/9173744691ac25f3cd94f35d4fc0e0a2b9d1ab17b4fe562acc07660552f95518 is in block 123571
both from 2011-05-13. Also note that they ended up being committed reverse order, since you don't have a strict order control over the final blockchain.

It contains a base 64 encoded image:

By manually copy pasting that into a file `v27sSra.base64` we can obtain the image with:
``

``
The exact same content appears to be present on the next input transaction 56d23a230042c094bc54bb72fc4c10a3f26750030b9927994e741d3689f5c09e on the same block.

The article also contains a higher resolution version of the image uploaded to the blockchain.

{title2=2013-}

A text/file upload system.

http://bitfossil.org/ an indexer website which interprets the format. Each page has an "abuse report" button to unindex presumably. TODO website source? Local indexer/extraction script? Ciro's indexer and its generated index can be found at:
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids#atomsea
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids#atomsea-index

Each AtomSea payload has a toplevel transaction which links to other transactions. All the linked transactions together make up the payload. The most common payload type is a text plus image, as is the case of <Nelson-Mandela.jpg>, which can be seen at http://bitfossil.com/78f0e6de0ce007f4dd4a09085e649d7e354f70bc7da06d697b167f353f115b8e/ where `78f0e6de0ce007f4dd4a09085e649d7e354f70bc7da06d697b167f353f115b8e` is the toplevel transaction ID: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/78f0e6de0ce007f4dd4a09085e649d7e354f70bc7da06d697b167f353f115b8e

See <Nelson-Mandela.jpg>{full} for a detailed reverse engineering of the format, and <AtomSea & EMBII data format>{full} for a summary of it.

http://apertus.io/ is the system to upload/index locally, and therefore likely part of the backend of bitfossil: https://github.com/HugPuddle/Apertus

These are of course likely all made by AtomSea & EMBII themselves while developing/testing their upload system.

They are also artsy peoeple themselves, and as pointed at https://twitter.com/AllenVandever/status/1563964396656812034 what they were doing was basicaly <non-fungible token> art, which became much much more popular a few years later around 2021.

The first upload that we could find at https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/tree/3f53e152ec9bb0d070dbcb8f9249d92f89effa70#atomsea-index was https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/44e80475dc363de2c7ee17b286f8cd49eb146165a79968a62c1c2c4cf80772c9[tx 44e80475dc363de2c7ee17b286f8cd49eb146165a79968a62c1c2c4cf80772c9] on https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/272573[block 272573] (2013-12-01) but it does not show on Bitfossil: http://bitfossil.org/44e80475dc363de2c7ee17b286f8cd49eb146165a79968a62c1c2c4cf80772c9/[]. This is was due to an upload bug explained by the following entry. By looking at the ASCII data at https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/out/0272.txt#L449 that this is meant to contain the same content as the following message: a quote from the <Bhagavad Gita>, so this is definitely a bugged version of the following one.

The next one is http://bitfossil.org/c9d1363ea517cd463950f83168ce8242ef917d99cd6518995bd1af927d335828/ on block 272577 (2013-12-02). It actually shows on bifossil and it reads:

He is the greatest.\br

~<Bhagavad Gita>[Bhagavad - Gita]

The bug message is definitely a reference to the previous non-visible bugged upload http://bitfossil.org/4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17/[], TODO understand exactly how they fucked up. This illustrates the beauty of the blockchain very well: unlike with <version control>, you don't just see selected snapshots: you see actual debug logs!!!

\Q[
There is a place where the sidewalk ends\br
And before the street begins,\br
And there the grass grows soft and white,\br
And there the sun burns crimson bright,\br
And there the moon-bird rests from his flight\br
To cool in the peppermint wind.\br

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black\br
And the dark street winds and bends.\br
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow\br
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow\br,
And watch where the chalk-white arrowls go\br
To the place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,\br
And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,\br
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know\br
The place where the sidewalk ends.\br

On a related note, https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/out/0273.txt#L54[tx f3c2e1178fa20a44e942e1137cd7125b376edaadb4fbd46be30b69fe89525d64] contains a speech from Mandela starting with:
``

"I am fundamentally an optimist ...

An "artificially" colored visualization of the <Arecibo message> ripped from <Wikipedia>: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arecibo_message.svg[] (with attribution).

The cool thing about this image is that it highlights the striking parallels between the encoding of the Arecibo message with crypto graffiti, because in both cases people were creating undocumented new ways of communicating with strangers on a new medium in those early blockchain days.

The associated message contains the Arecibo message as ASCII 0's and 1's. When properly cut at the newlines, they draw the message as </ASCII art>, as the original Arecibo encoding intends, here's a version with the 0's replaced by spaces to make it more readabale:

= AtomSea & EMBII data format
{c}
{parent=AtomSea & EMBII}

For a detailed analysis of one transaction see: <Nelson-Mandela.jpg>.

Best guess so far, all in ASCII hex of output scripts:
* remove the single output value different from first one from payload, that's the change, and it is randomly placed as far as I see
* 64 bytes: hex address of top level text
* 1 byte: some random punctuation
* decimal number of bytes of some payload
* 1 byte: some random punctuation
* 64 bytes: same as the first address
* CR LF
* ends in NUL

= Raw images
{parent=Images}

In this section contains a list of images we could find that wre uploaded as raw data to the blockchain, without any special encoding, e.g. as done by the <AtomSea & EMBII> system.

It is possible that some/most of those were uploaded via the <cryptograffiti.info> system, but since that indexer stopped working, and since the format is so non-specific, it is not possible be sure as far as we can tell.

These images were indexed by looking for standard transaction output script hashes that contain <JPEG> or <PNG> images immediately on the first payload byte based on file signature bytes and indexed/easily downloaded at https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids#image-indexing-and-download[].

"Danzhen" (?) hides silently in the mountains
]
and no <Google> hits, so maybe an original poem? What a hero. TODO transcribe the rest.

If Danzhen is a proper noun, the only hit is https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/洛桑丹珍[洛桑丹珍] (pinyin: Luosang Danzhen), who appears to be a <Chinese Communist Party> official that worked in Tibet. So does not feel likely.

\Q[Svým podpisem pod tímto textem potvrzuji, že Daniela Dudysová a Pavel Urbaczka v mé přítomnosti dne 20.8.2016 v Ropici projevili vůli uzavřít spolu manželství, přičemž ani jeden z těchto projevů se mi nejevil jako nesvobodný, nikoliv vážný, nesrozumitelný, omylný nebo uzavřený v tísni.]
Translation:
\Q[With my signature under this text, I confirm Daniela Dudysová and Pavel Urbaczka have, in my presence on 2016-08-20 in Ropice, expressed the will to enter marriage, whereas neither of their expressions seemed to me to be non-free, not serious, in error, or under distress.]
Signatures:
\Q[Tereza (unreadable) Hana (unreadable) Jakub (unreadable) Radim Kozub (unreadable) (unreadable) Lenka (unreadable)]

Petr also conjectures that Jakub may refer to https://www.blockchainlegal.cz/cs/tym[Jakub Olšina from Blockchain Legal]. <image Wedding on grass> on the same block contains a image of a wedding, presumably the same of the contract. The photo of the man might be the same person as https://www.linkedin.com/in/olsinajakub/[], but a bit younger.

At some point it stopped using Bitcoin mainline and moved to Bitcoin Cash instead: https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/cryptograffiti-rejects-bitcoin-core-bch-now-available-payment-method/ and therefore became useless. Existing indexes seem to have been broken as well.

= Base58 messages
{parent=Text}

Bitcoin addresses are by convention expressed in <Base58>, which is a human readable <binary-to-text encoding> invented by Bitcoin. It is a bit like <Base64>, but obsessed with eliminating characters that look like one another in popular but stupid fonts like capital "I" and lower case ell "l".

This seems to be one of the earliest strategies used to encode messages.

These messages were originally found with: https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids#payload-size-out-utxo-2vals

The generated text is however rather obfuscated by the limitations of Base58.

The following transactions contain base58 encoded messages on addresses:

Starting at https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/in/0139.txt#L1[tx cbbaa0a64924fe1d6ace3352f23242aa0028d4e0ff6ae8ed615244d66079cfb1] (https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/cbbaa0a64924fe1d6ace3352f23242aa0028d4e0ff6ae8ed615244d66079cfb1[2011-08-05]), <Catholic> <Bitcoin developer> <Luke Dashjr> started to <inscription (blockchain)>[inscribe] prayers in the <miner messages> of his <mining pool> "<Eligius pool>", usually one verse per message.

These are some of the earliest inscriptions in the blockchain, and therefore extremelly visible.

Although the prayer verses appear contiguous in ASCII dumps, Eligius was not actually mining every block: it is just that in those early days, miners still hadn't started adding advertisement messages to every block, so only Eligius shows up and appears contiguous.

At some point, opponents noticed these messages, and started adding atheist mockery graffiti replies, which appear interspersed in ASCII dumps with the prayer.

The first prayer is  the <Latin> version of the <Divine Praises>, a <Catholic> prayer composed in 1797 in <Italian> by Luigi Felici for the purpose of making reparation after saying or hearing sacrilege or blasphemy. Luke claims he was referring to anything in particular that came prior in the blockchain: https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1749182637569122434[]. There arent many earlier inscriptions at all to refer to in any case! The prayer and correspondong interrupts (in transaction outputs, not by other miners) ordered by block are:

* https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/139690[139690] (2011-08-05) prayer: "Eligius/Benedictus Deus. Benedictum Nomen Sanctum eius."

  \Q[In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.]
* <#Act of Contrition>
* <#Act of Hope>
and various others + output message interruptions.

Then at last come the first <miner message> interruptions. Luke explained on Twitterhttps://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1749183094081335413{ref} that they were also made by Eligius pool, as there was a system in which contributors besides Luke could submit their own strings:

Part of the goal of this dump is that the Bitcoin developers have a policy of not allowing logging on their talk channel, and this released it all to the blockchain forever where it cannot be deleted. These might just be more of <protests against larger block sizes>.
