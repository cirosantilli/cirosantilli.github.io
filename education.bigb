One of the causes <Ciro Santilli> care the most about: <ourbigbook com/motivation>.

<Ciro Santilli>'s view of the ideal teaching method: <how to teach>.

A list of complaints against education: <education is broken>{full}.

How to improve education? Simple:
* <tax the rich>[tax the fuck out of the rich] people and companies: <wealth tax> and invest it in education
* invest intelligently as mentioned at <what poor countries have to do to get richer>:
  * focus on fewer higher excellence schools that select the most promising poor students, rather than giving crappy average to everyone
  * use <OurBigBook.com>

{title=David Deutsch on Education interviewed by Aidan McCullen (2019)}
{description=
Key quote that hits the nail:
\Q[
\[...\] the existing assumptions behind educational systems are that the purpose of education is to transmit valuable knowledge faithfully from on generation to the next. From people who already have that knowledge, to people who don't.

So the knowledge is conceived of as a kind of valuable fluid, which you pour from one generation to the next, pour it into their brains.
]

So right... the purpose of education is not to teach facts. The purpose of education is to propose ways of thinking, which students themselves must try to apply and decide if it suits them! And use the patterns of thinking that are useful to <how to teach/help students achieve their goal>[reach their goals]. 

<video The Purpose of Education by Noam Chomsky (2012)>[Like Noam Chomsky], he proposes education has been a system of indoctrination more than anything else e.g. https://twitter.com/daviddeutschoxf/status/1406374921748496386[]:
\Q[All compulsory education, "tough" or not, "love" or not, in camps or not, and whether it "traumatises" or not, is a violation of human rights.]
At https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/1051475227476185089 another good quote by <Churchill>:
\Q[Headmasters have powers at their disposal with which Prime Ministers have never yet been invested.]

The same video also mentions in passing that <john Wheeler> used to be Deutsch's boss, but I can't find a reference for it very easily.

You lose what individualism you have, if you have enough of course, you retain some of it... Then you work the 8 hour job with almost a feeling of goodness, like you're doing something. Then you get married like marriage is a victory, and you have children like children is a victory... Marriage, birth, children. It's something they have to do because there's nothing else to do. There's no glory in it, there's no steam, there's no fire. It's very, very flat... You get caught into the stricture of what you're supposed to be and you have no other choice. You're finally molded and melded into what you're supposed to be. I didn't like this.]}

The goal of our <broken educational system> is not to teach.

It is simply a test of who can learn the most in the least amount of time.

What is being learnt is of little importance. it doesn't matter if it is <How to teach/Explain how to make money with the lesson>[useful] or <How to teach/Explain why the subject is beautiful>[beautiful] things.

The <exams are useless>[useless exams] are set exactly at a difficulty level that produces a <normal distribution> of grades:
* too hard and everyone gets 0, so you can't split people well
* too easy and everyone gets 100, so you can't split them well either
The difficulty is just set for your particular group of students.

As <Elon Musk> https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/10/elon-musk-college-for-fun-not-learning[put it]:
> I think college is basically for fun and to prove that you can do your chores, but they're not for learning

= Education as a system of indoctrination
{parent=Education is broken}

Whenever <Ciro Santilli> walks in front of a school and sees the tall gates it makes him sad. Maybe 8 year olds need gates. But do we need to protect 15 year olds like that? Students should be going out to see the world, both good and evil not hiding from it! We should instead be guiding them \i[to] the world. But instead, we are locking them up in <brainwashing> centers.

<video The Purpose of Education by Noam Chomsky (2012)> puts it well, education can be either be:
* a <brainwashing> to make people comply with The Establishment
* a way to get people genuinely interested and <how to teach/help students achieve their goal>[help them to reach their life goals]
He has spoken about that infinitely, e.g. from when he was thin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVqMAlgAnlo

https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curso_de_Ciências_Moleculares

Good <Portuguese (language)> overview: http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1806-11172017000300301&lng=pt&tlng=pt

A fantastic sounding full time 4-year course that any student could transfer to called that teaches various <natural science> topics, notably <mathematics>, <physics>, <chemistry> and <molecular biology>.

Many past students Ciro talked to however share a common frustration with the course: in the first 2 years at least, the "basic cycle", you have infinitely many courses, and no time to study, and <students must have a flexible choice of what to learn>[no choice of what to study], it is only in the latter 2 years (the advanced cycle) that you get the choices.

Also, if you get low grades in a single subject, your out. And <exams are useless> of course.

Here's a <Quora> question in <Portuguese (language)> about the course: https://pt.quora.com/Como-funciona-o-tal-do-curso-secreto-da-USP[], the only decent answer so far being: https://pt.quora.com/Como-funciona-o-tal-do-curso-secreto-da-USP/answer/Victor-Soares-31[]. Very disappointing to hear.

On the advanced cycle, you have a lot of academic freedom. You are basically supposed to pick a research project with an advisor and go for it, with a small amount of mandatory course hours. Ciro was told in 2022 that you can even have advisors from other universities or industry, and that it is perfectly feasible to take courses in another university and validate the course hours later on. Fantastic!!!

Students from the entire <University of São Paulo> can apply to transfer to it only after joining the university, with the guarantee that they can go back to their original courses if they don't adapt to the new course, which is great!

Not doing it is one of <Ciro Santilli>'s regrets in life, see also: <don't be a pussy>.

Around 2007, they were in a really shady building of the University, but when Ciro checked in 2021, they had apparently moved to a shiny new entrepreneurship-focused building. Fantastic news!!!

This place has one of the best changes of spawning the first <Brazilian> <Nobel Prize> or <unicorn (startup)>.

One of the <Brazilians> who came to <École Polytechnique> together with Ciro was from this course. The fact that he is one of the most intelligent people Ciro knows gave further credit to that course in his eyes.

Sometimes <Ciro Santilli> regrets not having done a <PhD>. But this section makes him feel better about himself. To be fair, part of the merit is on him, part of the reason he didn't move on was the strong odour of bullshit oozing down to Masters level. A good PhH might have opened interesting job opportunities however, given that you <Students must have a flexible choice of what to learn>[don't really learn anything useful before that point in your education].

  \Q[Scientific journals are perhaps one of the most damaging IP rackets. Scientists are funded by governments to do research and publish papers. Reviews of these papers are done by other publicly funded scientists. Even paper selection and formatting for publication is done by scientists. So what do journals actually do? Nearly nothing.]

= Exams are useless
{synonym}
{title2}

Exams as a prerequisite for a degree are useless. Exams as part of a degree must be abolished. And degrees must be abolished. Ultimately the only metrics that really matter are <money> and fame. See also: <ourbigbook com/motivation>.

The only thing exams should matter for is as a screening tool to select people with specific abilities that you care about as an employer or <principal investigator>. If:
* you have no idea about what the content of specific exams are (and you don't because they are all ad-hoc university secrets)
* or don't have a way to <machine learn> what grades correlate with your desired performance (you don't because where's the data?)
then exams are useless for your purposes. then might as well just go by interviews (basically what all employers do already, though not PIs). Degrees are too course grained to mean anything to anybody. Employers and PIs likely only care about very few specific subjects.

Once the question of an exam has been formulated, the usefulness of the problem is already been completely destroyed, because formulating the problem that matters is the most important part of things. And any problem with an answer, is useless to put effort into: <how to teach/give answers>.

Furthermore, preventing people from searching for answers while answering an exam, AKA preventing "cheating", also makes absolutely no sense. In the real world, we want people to find answers as quickly as possible! We should be teaching people how to "cheat"! What we should teach them instead is what a <fucking> <license> is, and what you have to do to comply with it.

And if you must absolutely have exams, <exam as a service>[they must be open to anyone who wants to applies. Then people have to pay to take the exam, with subsidies for "official course takers", who are spending 100x more anyways due to not living with their parents].

And if you pass the exam, you pass the course, without any further time requirements.

And those exams must be applied by professional test application companies to ensure no cheating and to factor out the anti-cheat work, while still making the tests available to people anywhere.

A quote from <Richard Feynman> present in the book <Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman chapter O Americano, Outra Vez!>:
\Q[
You cannot get educated by this self-propagating system in which people study to pass exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything.

You learn something by doing it yourself, by asking questions, by thinking, and by experimenting.
]

The only metric that matters is "to feel that you've satisfied youre curiosity". When one studies for that, it can take a lot more time to actually learn everything, because it is sometimes not as clear when you should stop. But it is the only way to go deeper.

A person's understanding is the most <illiquid> asset that exists, to judge that based only on standardized exams, is a certain way to fail to identify top talent.

Related: <how to teach/exams and homework are useless, only projects matter>

= Exam as a service
{parent=Exam}

This is <Ciro Santilli>'s name for the idea that we should not have structured degrees at <university> that require entry exams, only tests that anybondy could take, likely for free, and then they would just have proof that they know the stuff for e.g. teachers that care about a subject while selecting students to work with them in research.

We just need control rooms where someone can watch students for cheating. Multiple different exams can be taken in the same room of course, students just have to sign up in advance. The exams should happen regularly depending on demand. E.g. extremelly common subjects should happen every month, and highly specialized ones every 6 months or 1 year.

Questions should be always taken from an open question pool which also contains answers, thus allowing anyone to effectively study for it.

How many questions can you actually come up with about a given non research subject, right?

We then make an API available, so that students can grant access to specific results to anyone they choose, or even make the results public for anyone to see. This way the people that care about the exams can just machine learn what exams correlate with their desired performance.

{tag=Entity against giving answer to problem sets}
{title2=2015-}

https://promys-europe.org/

<European> <PROMYS> offshoot hosted at the <University of Oxford>. Started in 2015.

The structure seems to be: come every day for 6 weeks, one problem sheet per day. Go.

Strongly against <giving answer to problem sets>... sad, as of 2024: https://promys-europe.org/students/faq (https://web.archive.org/web/20240618215501/https://promys-europe.org/students/faq[archive]):
\Q[
When do I get the solutions to the problems on the problem sets?

When you discover them for yourself: on your own or collaborating with other students. Returning students and counsellors and faculty will support and encourage you, but not by giving you the answers (hint: they don't even give hints). What PROMYS Europe does is offer you the tools and structure to enable you to be a creative mathematician.
]
and:
\Q[
What rules are there at PROMYS Europe?

They're mostly the ones you'd expect: don't do anything dangerous or illegal, don't divide by zero, don't even try to skip Friday Fun, and don't give anyone solutions to the problem sets (though collaboration is definitely OK).
]
It does not seem to be the case for the <PROMYS>[American version] however after a quick look: https://promys.org/programs/promys/for-students/faq/[]. Sad to see.

Also participants are strongly forbidden from sharing the problem sheets with anyone from outside the program. <Ciro Santilli> asked a participant face to face if he could take a look, but was told that they are not allowed to share it. So it is a very clear and strict order. Truly sad.

These experiences would shape his concerns for the poor and would help to construct his particular educational viewpoint. Freire stated that poverty and hunger severely affected his ability to learn. These experiences influenced his decision to dedicate his life to improving the lives of the poor: "I didn't understand anything because of my hunger. I wasn't dumb. It wasn't lack of interest. My social condition didn't allow me to have an education. Experience showed me once again the relationship between social class and knowledge"]

\Q[it is not specifically about schooling but about the upbringing of a rich man’s son, Émile, by a tutor who is given unlimited authority over him.

Also:
\Q[He learns a trade, among other things. He studies science, not by receiving instruction in its facts but by making the instruments necessary to solve scientific problems of a practical sort.]

Book 1:
\Q[
I do not consider these laughable establishments called Colleges as a public institution.

There are in several schools, and especially in the <University of Paris>, Professors whom I like, whom I esteem very much, and whom I believe very capable of instructing young people well, if they were not forced to follow established usage. I urge one of them to publish the reform project he designed. We will perhaps finally be tempted to cure the illness by seeing that it is not without a remedy.
