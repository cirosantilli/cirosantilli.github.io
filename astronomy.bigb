<Ciro Santilli> likes to learn astronomy a bit like he learns geography: go down some lists of "stuff that seems most relevant in some criteria to us!", possibly at different size scales e.g.:
* <stars nearest to the Sun>
* <brightest natural objects in the sky>
* <galaxies nearest the Milky Way>
* <black holes nearest to the Sun>

= Good targets for amateur astronomy
{parent=Amateur astronomy}

Looking at most <astronomical object> through a <telescope> is boring because you only see a white ball or point every time. Such targets would likely only be interesting with <spectroscopy> analysis.

There are however some objects that you can see the structure of even with an <amateur telescope>, and that makes them very exciting.

Some good ones:
* <The Moon>, notably crater detail.
* <Saturn>. Clearly visible to the naked eye, but looks like a ball. But under an amateur telescope, you can clearly see that there is a disk. Clearly discerning that the disk is a ring, i.e. seeing the gap, is a bit harder though.
* <Jupiter>. Clearly visible to the naked eye, it is quite huge. The four <Galilean moons>, being <Earth>-sized, are incredibly clearly visible, tested on <Celestron NexStar 4SE> 25mm/9mm eyepiece. Colored gas clouds are hard though, you will likely just see it bright white. https://www.reddit.com/r/telescopes/comments/35xrbb/how_can_i_see_the_color_of_jupiter_with_my/
* a <double star>. As mentioned at https://www.relativelyinteresting.com/10-astronomical-targets-new-telescope/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albireo[Albireo] are incredibly separated. Also it is is easy to find manually being in a major well known constellation. It is no wonder it is not quite even known if they are gravitationally bound or not!
* <Andromeda Galaxy>. This is when things start getting hard. You can see a faint cloud, but it is not super clear that it has a center.

  One important understanding is that <it is not possible to see stars outside of the Milky Way by naked eye>.

  It is at this point that you start to learn that pictures of faint objects require longer term exposure and averaging of the images taken. For this you need:
  * a digital camera attached to the scope
  * a computerized scope that slowly moves to track the point of interest
  * image processing software that does the averaging
  Just looking through the scope to immediately see something is not enough.

  <video Andromeda Galaxy with only a Camera, Lens, & Tripod by Nebula Photos (2020)> gives a good notion of expectation adjustment.

<It is not possible to see stars outside of the Milky Way by naked eye>.

With <telescopes> however, it is possible. https://www.quora.com/Can-we-distinguish-individual-stars-in-other-galaxies-or-would-it-be-equivalent-to-say-we-know-there-are-other-forests-of-stars-galaxies-but-we-cant-tell-the-individual-trees-stars-What-is-the-farthest-individual/answer/Jerzy-Micha%C5%82-Pawlak contains an amazing answer that mentions two special cases of the furthest ones:
* <#gravitational lensing> observation
* a star that is far but visible because its light is reflected by a nearby <#nebulae>

But what we can definitely see are <#globular clusters> of galaxies. E.g. the article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87 basically gauges the size of galaxies by the number of <#globular clusters> that they contain.

<Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman> chapter An Offer You Must Refuse (a play on words on <The Godfather (1972)>) has an interesting historical mention from the early 1950s while at <Caltech>:
\Q[
The next day, I had the greatest luck in making a decision. God must have set it up to help me decide. I was walking to my office, and a guy came running up to me and said, "Hey, Feynman! Did you hear what happened? Baade found that there are two different populations of stars! All the measurements we had been making of the distances to the galaxies had been based on Cephid variables of one type, but there's another type, so the universe is twice, or three, or even four times as old as we thought!"

I knew the problem. In those days, the <age of Earth>[earth appeared to be older] than the universe. The earth was four and a half billion, and the universe was only a couple, or three billion years old. It was a great puzzle. And this discovery resolved all that: The universe was now demonstrably older than was previously thought. And I got this information right away - the guy came running up to me to tell me all this.

= CMB
{c}
{synonym}
{title2}

If you point a <light> detector to any empty area of the sky, you will still get some light.

The existence of this is quite mind blowing, since "there is nothing there emitting that light".

To make sense of how it is possible to see this light, you can think of the universe as the <expanding raisin bread model>, but it expands faster than light (thus the existence of the <cosmological event horizon>), so we are still receiving light form the middle, not the borders.

<CMB> is basically perfectly <black-body radiation> at 2.725 48 <Kelvin>[K], but it has small variations with variations of the order of 200 microKelvin: <cosmic microwave background anisotropy>.

= Cosmic microwave background anisotropy
{parent=Cosmic microwave background}
{tag=2006 Nobel Prize in Physics}

There is a slight variation in temperature of <CMB> across the sky of the order of 200 microKelvin. It is small to the ~2.7 K average temperature, but it can be measured.

If the <initial conditions> of the <big bang> and the <laws of physics> were perfectly symmetric, then we could expect the <universe> to just be one perfectly uniform boring soup.

But instead some asymetry made all the fun weird things we see today happen eventually, like <galaxies> and <life>.

And the <cosmic microwave background> serves as a way for us to look back in time to the early conditions of the universe, as it was set in stone as soon as the universe became transparent to this <light> during <recombination (cosmology)>.

Or if you want to get poetic, it is the closest we can ever get to listening to the original word of <God> when he setup the <initial conditions> of the universe.

The ansiotropies of CMB is the ultimate astronomical compass we will ever have, as it is the thing with the least <proper motion>.

First proper <galaxies nearest the Milky Way>[nearest galaxy to the Milky Way]. Everything in the middle in the <Local group> is either a satellite of the Milky Way or Andromeda.

Many Andromeda satellite galaxies are simply numbered Andromeda II, Andromeda III and so on.

As described on Wikipedia, the observational history of Andromeda is fascinating. Little by little, people noticed that it had a different nature to many other objects observed on the sky, and the hypothesis that there are other galaxies like ours grew in force.

Part of our fascination with Andromeda is due to how similar in size and shape and close it is to the Milky Way.

It is clearly the only thing so large and so close.

Andromeda is, without a doubt, our sister galaxy.

One can't help but wonder if there is some <alien> looking back at us when we are looking at them through our <telescope>.

Andromeda is also the furthest object from <Earth> that can be seen with the naked eye.https://www.relativelyinteresting.com/10-astronomical-targets-new-telescope/{ref} Not surprising, as it literally shines with the strength of a trillion suns!
