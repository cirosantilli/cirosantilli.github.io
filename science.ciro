\x[ciro-santilli] often wonders to himself, how much of the natural sciences can one learn in a lifetime? Certainly, a very strong basis, with concrete experimental and \x[physics], \x[chemistry] and \x[biology] should be attainable to all? How much Ciro manages to learning and teach in those areas is a kind of success metric of Ciro's life.

Physics is the \x[art] of predicting the future by modelling the world with \x[mathematics].

\x[ciro-santilli] doesn't know physics. He writes about it partly to start playing with some scientific content for: \x[ourbigbook-com], partly because this stuff is just amazingly beautiful.

Ciro's main intellectual \x[physics] \x[fetish]{p} are to learn \x[quantum-electrodynamics] (understanding the point of \x[lie-group]{p} being a subpart of that) and \x[condensed-matter-physics].

Every science \x[reductionism][is Physics in disguise], but the number of objects in the real world is so large that we can't solve the real equations in practice.

Luckily, due to \x[emergence], we can use uglier higher level approximations of the world to solve many problems, with the complex limits of applicability of those approximations.

Therefore, such higher level approximations are highly specialized, and given different names such as:
* \x[chemistry]
* \x[biology]

As of 2019, all known physics can be described by two theories:
* the \x[standard-model]
* \x[general-relativity]

Unifying those two into the \x[theory-of-everything] one of the major goals of modern physics.

= How to teach and learn physics
{parent=physics}
{tag=essays-by-ciro-santilli}

The approach many courses take to physics, specially "modern Physics" is really bad, this is how it should be taught:
* start by describing experiments that the previous best theory did not explain. This gets intimately entangled with basically learning the \x[history-of-physics], which is extremely beneficial as also highlighted by \x[ron-maimon], and also because \x[there-is-value-in-tutorials-written-by-early-pioneers-of-the-field].

  In the \x[surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman-chapter-o-americano-outra-vez] \x[richard-feynman] describes his experience teaching in \x[brazil] in the early 1950s, and how everything was memorized, without any explanation of the experiments or that the theory has some relationship to the real world! Although things have improved considerably since, Ciro still feels that some areas of physics are still taught without enough experiments described upfront. Notably, ironically, \x[quantum-field-theory], which is where Feynman himself worked. Feynman gave huge importance to understanding and explaining experiments, as can also be seen on \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].
* then, give the final formula for the next best theory
* then, give all the important final implications of that formula, and how it amazingly describes the experiments. In particular this means: \x[doing-physics-means-calculating-a-number]
* then, give some mathematical intuition on the formulas, and how the main equation could have been derived
* finally, then and only then, start deriving the outcomes of the main formula in detail

This is likely because at some point, experiments get more and more complicated, and so people are tempted to say "this is the truth" instead of "this is why we think this is the truth", which is much harder.

But we can't be lazy, there is no replacement to the why.

{parent=how-to-teach-and-learn-physics}

In Physics, in order to test a theory, you must be able to extract a number from it.

It does not matter how, if it is exact, or numerical, or a message from \x[god]: a number has to come out of the formulas in the end, and you have to compare it with the experimental data.

Many theoretical physicists seem to forget this in their lectures, see also: \x[how-to-teach-and-learn-physics]{full}.

{wiki}

Classic theory predicts that the output frequency must be the same as the input one since the electromagnetic wave makes the electron vibrate with same frequency as itself, which then irradiates further waves.

But the output waves are longer because \x[planck-einstein-relation][photons are discrete and energy is proportional to frequency]:

The formula is exactly that of two \x[relativistic] billiard balls colliding.

Therefore this is evidence that \x[photon]{p} exist and have momentum.

{title2=1947}

Published as Fine Structure of the Hydrogen Atom by a Microwave Method by \x[willis-lamb] and Robert Retherford (1947) on \x[physical-review].

\x[microwave] technology was developed in \x[world-war-ii] for \x[radar], notably at the \x[mit-radiation-laboratory]. Before that, people were using much higher frequencies such as the \x[visible-spectrum]. But to detect small energy differences, you need to look into longer wavelengths.

This experiment was fundamental to the development of \x[quantum-electrodynamics]. As mentioned at \x[genius-richard-feynman-and-modern-physics-by-james-gleick-1994] chapter "Shrinking the infinities", before the experiment, people already knew that trying to add \x[electromagnetism] to the \x[dirac-equation] led to \x[infinities-in-quantum-field-theory][infinities] using previous methods, and something needed to change urgently. However for the first time now the theorists had one precise number to try and hack their formulas to reach, not just a philosophical debate about infinities, and this led to major breakthroughs. The same book also describes the experiment briefly as:
\Q[Willis Lamb had just shined a beam of microwaves onto a hot wisp of hydrogen blowing from an oven.]

This one has open accesses as of 2021: https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.72.241

It is two pages and a half long.

They were at \x[columbia-university] in the \x[columbia-radiation-laboratory]. Robert was Willis' graduate student.

Previous less experiments had already hinted at this effect, but they were too imprecise to be sure.

= Defining properties of elementary particles
{parent=elementary-particle}

A suggested at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 3.9 "Elementary particles", it appears that in the \x[standard-model], the behaviour of each particle can be uniquely defined by the following five numbers:
* due to \x[spacetime-symmetry]{p}:
  * \x[mass]
  * \x[spin-physics]
* due to \x[internal-symmetry]{p}:
  * \x[electric-charge]
  * \x[weak-charge]
  * \x[color-charge]

E.g. for the \x[electron] we have:
* mass: $9.1 \times 10^{-31}$
* spin: 1/2
* electric charge: $1.6 \times 10^{-29}$
* weak charge: -1/2
* color charge: 0

Once you specify these properties, you could in theory just pluck them into the \x[standard-model-lagrangian] and you could simulate what happens. 

Setting new random values for those properties would also allow us to create new particles. It appears unknown why we only see the particles that we do, and \x[parameters-of-the-standard-model][why they have the values of properties they have].

= Photon
{parent=elementary-particle}
{wiki}

Initially light was though of as a wave because it experienced interference as shown by experiments such as:
* \x[double-slit-experiment]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_rings

But then, some key experiments also start suggesting that \x[light] is made up of \x[discrete] packets:
* \x[compton-scattering], also suggests that photons carry momentum
* \x[photoelectric-effect]
* \x[single-photon-production-and-detection-experiments]
and in the understanding of the 2020 \x[standard-model] the photon is one of the \x[elementary-particle]{p}{parent}.

This duality is fully described mathematically by \x[quantum-electrodynamics]{parent}, where the photon is modelled as a quantized excitation of the photon field.

But then since the target is spacelike separated, there exists a \x[inertial-frame-of-reference] in which that event happens before the present, which would be hard to make sense of.

One interesting thing he mentions is that you could get single photons by making your sunglasses thicker and thicker to reduce how many photons pass, but one big downside problem is that then you don't know when the photon is going to come through, that becomes essentially random, and then you can't use this technique if you need two photons at the same time, which is often the case, see also: \x[two-photon-interference-experiment].

The most important type of lens is the \x[biconvex-spherical-lens].

= Biconvex spherical lens
{parent=lens}

Focal length

Each side is a sphere section. They don't have to have the same radius, they are still simple to understand with different radiuses.

The two things you have to have in mind that this does are:
* converges \x[parallel-light] to a point at center at distance $f$ known as the \x[focal-length].

  This is for example why you can use lenses to burn things with \x[sun] rays, which are basically parallel.

  Conversely, if the input is a \x[point-light-source] at the \x[focal-length], it gets converted into \x[parallel-light].
* image formation: it converges all rays coming from a given source point to a single point image. This amplifies the signal, and forms an image at a plane.

  The source image can be far away, and the virtual image can be close to the lens. This is exactly what we need for a camera.

  For each distance on one side, it only works for another distance on the other side. So when we set the distance between the lens and the detector, this sets the distance of the source object, i.e. the focus. The equation is:
  $$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_1} + \frac{1}{S_2}$$
  where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the two distances.

{parent=standard-model}

\x[physicist]{c}{p} love to talk about that stuff, but no one ever has the guts to explain it into enough detail to show its beauty!!!

Perhaps the wisest thing is to just focus entirely on the \x[u-1] part to start with, which is the \x[quantum-electrodynamics] one, which is the simplest and most useful and historically first one to come around.

Perhaps the best explanation is that if you assume those \x[internal-symmetry]{p}, then you can systematically make "obvious" educated guesses at the interacting part of the \x[standard-model-lagrangian], which is the fundamental part of the \x[standard-model]. See e.g.:
* \x[derivation-of-the-quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian]
* \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 7 "Interaction Theory" derives all three of \x[quantum-electrodynamics], \x[weak-interaction] and \x[quantum-chromodynamics] Lagrangian from each of the symmetries!

One bit underlying reason is: \x[noether-s-theorem].

Notably, https://axelmaas.blogspot.com/2010/08/global-and-local-symmetries.html gives a good overview:
\Q[
A local symmetry transformation is much more complicated to visualize. Take a rectangular grid of the billiard balls from the last post, say ten times ten. Each ball is spherical symmetric, and thus invariant under a rotation. The system now has a global and a local symmetry. A global symmetry transformation would rotate each ball by the same amount in the same direction, leaving the system unchanged. A local symmetry transformation would rotate each ball about a different amount and around a different axis, still leaving the system to the eye unchanged. The system has also an additional global symmetry. Moving the whole grid to the left or to the right leaves the grid unchanged. However, no such local symmetry exists: Moving only one ball will destroy the grid's structure.

Such global and local symmetries play an important role in physics. The global symmetries are found to be associated with properties of particles, e. g., whether they are matter or antimatter, whether they carry electric charge, and so on. Local symmetries are found to be associated with forces. In fact, all the fundamental forces of nature are associated with very special local symmetries. For example, the weak force is actually associated in a very intricate way with local rotations of a four-dimensional sphere. The reason is that, invisible to the eye, everything charged under the weak force can be characterized by a arrow pointing from the center to the surface of such a four-dimensional sphere. This arrow can be rotated in a certain way and at every individual point, without changing anything which can be measured. It is thus a local symmetry. This will become more clearer over time, as at the moment of first encounter this appears to be very strange indeed.
]{id=quote-axelmaas-local-symmetry}
so it seems that that's why they are so key: \x[local-symmetry]{p} map to the forces themselves!!!

https://axelmaas.blogspot.com/2010/09/symmetries-of-standard-model.html then goes over all symmetries of the \x[standard-model] uber quickly, including the global ones.

Unified all previous electro-magnetism theories into one equation.

Explains the propagation of light as a wave, and matches the previously known relationship between the \x[speed-of-light] and electromagnetic constants.

* $B_x(t, x,y,z)$, $B_y(t, x,y,z)$, $B_z(t, x,y,z)$: directions of the magnetic field $\B : \R^4 \to \R^3$
and two known input functions:
* $\rho : \R^3\ to \R$: density of charges in space
* $\J : \R^3 \to \R^3$: current vector in space. This represents the strength of moving charges in space.

Due to the \x[conservation-of-charge] however, those input functions have the following restriction:
$$
\pdv{\rho}{t} + \div{\mathbf{\J}} = 0
$$
{title=Charge conservation}

Also consider the following cases:
* if a spherical charge is moving, then this of course means that $\rho$ is changing with time, and at the same time that a current exists
* in an \x[ideal] infinite cylindrical wire however, we can have constant $\rho$ in the wire, but there can still be a current because those charges are moving

  Such infinite cylindrical wire is of course an ideal case, but one which is a good approximation to the huge number of electrons that travel in a actual wire.

The goal of finding $\E$ and $\B$ is that those fields allow us to determine the force that gets applied to a charge via the \x[equation-lorentz-force], and then to find the force we just need to integrate over the entire body.

Finally, now that we have defined all terms involved in the Maxwell equations, let's see the equations:

$$
div{\E} = \frac{\rho}{\vacuumPermittivity}
$$
{title=Gauss' law}

$$
div{\B} = 0

= Explicit scalar form of the Maxwell's equations
{parent=maxwell-s-equations}

For numerical algorithms and to get a more low level understanding of the equations, we can expand all terms to the simpler and more explicit form:
$$
\pdv{E_x}{x} + \pdv{E_y}{x} +
\pdv{E_z}{x} =
\frac{\rho}{\vacuumPermittivity}
\\

\pdv{B_x}{x} +
\pdv{B_y}{x} +
\pdv{B_z}{x} =
0
\\

\pdv{E_z}{y} - \pdv{E_y}{z} = -\pdv{B_x}{t} \\
\pdv{E_x}{z} - \pdv{E_z}{x} = -\pdv{B_y}{t} \\
\pdv{E_y}{x} - \pdv{E_x}{y} = -\pdv{B_z}{t} \\

\pdv{B_z}{y} - \pdv{B_y}{z} = \vacuumPermeability \left(J_x + \vacuumPermittivity \pdv{E_x}{t} \right) \\
\pdv{B_x}{z} - \pdv{B_z}{x} = \vacuumPermeability \left(J_y + \vacuumPermittivity \pdv{E_y}{t} \right) \\
\pdv{B_y}{x} - \pdv{B_x}{y} = \vacuumPermeability \left(J_z + \vacuumPermittivity \pdv{E_z}{t} \right) \\

= Overdetermination of Maxwell's equations
{parent=explicit-scalar-form-of-the-maxwell-s-equations}
{wiki=Maxwell's_equations#Overdetermination_of_Maxwell's_equations}

As seen from \x[explicit-scalar-form-of-the-maxwell-s-equations], this expands to 8 equations, so the question arises if the system is over-determined because it only has 6 functions to be determined.

As explained on the Wikipedia page  however, this is not the case, because if the first two equations hold for the initial condition, then the othe six equations imply that they also hold for all time, so they can be essentially omitted.

It is also worth noting that the first two equations don't involve time derivatives. Therefore, they can be seen as spacial constraints.

TODO: the \x[electric-field] and \x[magnetic-field] can be expressed in terms of the \x[electric-potential] and \x[magnetic-vector-potential]. So then we only need 4 variables?

Explains how it is possible \x[invariance-of-the-speed-of-light][that everyone observes the same speed of light, even if they are moving towards or opposite to the light]!!!

This was first best observed by the \x[michelson-morley-experiment], which uses the movement of the Earth at different times of the year to try and detect differences in the speed of light.

This leads leads to the following conclusions:
* to \x[length-contraction] and time dilation
* the speed of light is the maximum speed anything can reach

All of this goes of course completely against our daily Physics intuition.

The "special" in the name refers to the fact that it is a superset of \x[general-relativity], which also explains gravity in a single framework.

Since time and space get all messed up together, you have to be very careful to understand what it means to say "I observed this to happen over there at that time", otherwise you will go crazy. A good way to think about is this:
* use \x[einstein-synchronization] to setup a bunch of clocks for every position in your \x[frame-of-reference]
* on every point of space, you put a little detector which records events and the time of the event
* each detector can only detect events locally, i.e. events that happen very close to the detector
* then, after the event, the detectors can send a signal to you, who is sitting at the origin, telling you what they detected

The equation that allows us to calculate stuff in \x[special-relativity]!

Take two observers with identical rules and stopwatch, and aligned axes, but one is on a car moving at towards the $+x$ direction at speed $v$.

TODO image.

When both observe an event, if we denote:
* $(t, x, y, z)$ the observation of the standing observer
* $(t', x', y', z')$ the observation of the ending observer on a car
It is of course arbitrary who is standing and who is moving, we will just use the term "standing" for the one without primes.

Then the coordinates of the event observed by the observer on the car are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t' & = \gamma \left( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right) \\
x' & = \gamma \left( x - v t \right) \\
y' & = y \\
z' & = z
\end{aligned}
$$
where:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}
$$

Note that if $\frac{v}{c}$ tends towards zero, then this reduces to the usual \x[galilean-transformation]{p} which our intuition expects:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t' & = t
x' & = x - v t \\
y' & = y \\
z' & = z
\end{aligned}
$$

This explains why we don't observe special relativity in our daily lives: macroscopic objects move too slowly compared to light, and $\frac{v}{c}$ is almost zero.

Basically a synonym of \x[lorentz-covariance]?

= Lorentz transform consequence: everyone sees the same speed of light
{c}
{parent=lorentz-transformation}

OK, so let's verify the main desired consequence of the \x[lorentz-transformation]: that everyone observes the same \x[speed-of-light].

Observers will measure the speed of light by calculating how long it takes the light going towards $+x$ cross a rod of length $L = x_2 - x_1$ laid in the x axis at position $X1$.

TODO image.

Each observer will observe two events:
* $(t_1, x_1, y_1, z_1)$: the light touches the left side of the rod
* $(t_2, x_2, y_2, z_2)$: the light touches the right side of the rod

Supposing that the standing observer measures the speed of light as $c$ and that light hits the left side of the rod at time $T1$, then he observes the coordinates:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t_1 & = T1 \\
x_1 & = X1 \\
t_2 & = \frac{L}{c} \\
x_2 & = X1 + L \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, if we transform for the moving observer:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t_1' & = \gamma \left( t_1 - \frac{v x_1}{c^2} \right) \\
x_1' & = \gamma \left( x_1 - v t_1             \right) \\
t_2' & = \gamma \left( t_2 - \frac{v x_2}{c^2} \right) \\
x_2' & = \gamma \left( x_2 - v t_2             \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
and so the moving observer measures the speed of light as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
c' & = \frac{x_2' - x_1'}{t_2' - t_1'} \\
   & = \frac{(x_2 - v t_2) - (x_1 - v t_1)}{(t_2 - \frac{v x_2}{c^2}) - (t_1 - \frac{v x_1}{c^2})} \\
   & = \frac{(x_2 - x_1) - v (t_2 - t_1)}{(t_2 - t_1) - \frac{v}{c^2} (x_2 - x_1)} \\
   & = \frac{\frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1} - v}{1 - \frac{v}{c^2} \frac{x_2 -x_1}{t_2 - t_1}} \\
   & = \frac{c - v}{1 - \frac{v}{c^2} c} \\
   & = \frac{c - v}{\frac{c - v}{c}} \\
   & = c \\
\end{aligned}
$$

= Length contraction
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

Suppose that a rod has is length $L$ measured on a rest frame $S$ (or maybe even better: two identical rulers were manufactured, and one is taken on a spaceship, a bit like the \x[twin-paradox]).

Question: what is the length $L'$ than an observer in frame $S'$ moving relative to $S$ as speed $v$ observe the rod to be?

The key idea is that there are two events to consider in each frame, which we call 1 and 2:
* the left end of the rod is an observation event at a given position at a given time: $x_1$ and $t_1$ for $S$ or $x'_1$ and $t'_1$ for $S'$
* the right end of the rod is an observation event at a given position at a given time : $x_2$ and $t_2$ for $S$ or $x'_2$ and $t'_2$ for $S'$
Note that what you visually observe on a photograph is a different measurement to the more precise/easy to calculate two event measurement. On a photograph, it seems you might not even see the contraction in some cases as mentioned at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotation

Measuring a length means to measure the $x_2 - x_1$ difference for a single point in time in your frame ($t2 = t1$).

So what we want to obtain is $x'_2 - x'_1$ for any given time $t'2 = t'1$.

In summary, we have:
$$
\begin{aligned}
L  &= x_2  &- x_1 \\
L' &= x'_2 &- x'_1
t'_2 = t'_1
\end{aligned}
$$

By plugging those values into the \x[lorentz-transformation], we can eliminate $t_2 and t_1$, and conclude that for any $t'_2 = t'_1$, the length contraction relation holds:
$$
L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}
$$

The key question that needs intuitive clarification then is: but how can this be symmetric? How can both observers see each other's rulers shrink?

And the key answer is: because to the second observer, the measurements made by the first observer are not simultaneous. Notably, the two measurement events are obviously \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p} by looking at the \x[light-cone], and therefore can be measured even in different orders by different observers.

What you would see the moving rod look like on a photo of a \x[length-contraction] experiment, as opposed as using two locally measured separate spacetime events to measure its length.

One of the best ways to think about it is the \x[transversal-time-dilation] thought experiment.

= Transversal time dilation
{parent=time-dilation}
{wiki=Time_dilation#Simple_inference_of_velocity_time_dilation}

Light watch transverse to direction of motion. This case is interesting because it separates \x[length-contraction] from \x[time-dilation] completely.

Of course, as usual in \x[special-relativity], calling something "time dilation" leads us to \x[mind-boggling] ideas of "symmetry breaking": if both frames have a light watch, how can both possibly observe the other to be time dilated?

And the answer to this, is the usual: in special relativity time and space are interwoven in a \x[fucked] up way, everything is just a spacetime event.

In this case, there are three spacetime events of interest: both clocks start at same position, your beam hits up at x=0, moving frame hits up at x>0.

Those two mentioned events are \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p}, and therefore even though they seem simultaneous to you, they are not going to be simultaneous to the moving observer!

If \x[einstein-synchronization][little clock one meter away from you] tells you that at the time of some event (your light beam hit up) the moving light watch was only 50% up, this is just a number given by your one meter away watch!

= Twin paradox
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

The key question is: why is this not symmetrical?

One answer is: because one of the twin accelerates, and therefore changes inertial frames.

But the better answer is: understand what happens when the stationary twin sends light signals at constant time intervals to each other. When does the travelling twin receives them?

By doing that, we see that "all the extra aging happens immediately when the twin turns around":
* on the out trip, both twins receive signals at constant intervals
* when the moving twin turns around and starts to accelerate through different inertial frames, shit happens:
  * the moving twin suddenly notices that the rate of signals from the stationary twin increased. They are getting older faster than us!
  * the stationary twin suddenly notices that the rate of signals from the moving twin decreased. They are getting older slower than us!
* then when the moving twin reaches the return velocity, both see constant signal rates once again

\Image[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/TwinParadoxProperAcceleration.svg]
{height=600}
{title=Twin paradox illustration with twins sending light signals at regular intervals.}

Another way of understanding it is: you have to make all calculations on a \i[single] inertial frame for the entire trip.

Supposing the sibling quickly accelerates out (or magically starts moving at constant speed), travels at constant speed, and quickly accelerates back, and travels at constant speed setup, there are three frames that seem reasonable:
* the frame of the non-accelerating sibling
* the outgoing trip of the accelerating sibling
* the return trip of the accelerating sibling

If you do that, all three calculations give the exact same result, which is reassuring.

Another way to understand it is to do explicit integrations of the acceleration: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/242043/what-is-the-proper-way-to-explain-the-twin-paradox/242044#242044 This is the least insightful however :-)

It appears that \x[maxwell-s-equations] can be derived directly from Coulomb's law + special relativity:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism_and_special_relativity#Deriving_magnetism_from_electrostatics
* https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/3618/can-maxwells-equations-be-derived-from-coulombs-law-and-special-relativity
This idea is suggested by the \x[charged-particle-moving-at-the-same-speed-of-electrons-thought-experiment], which indicates that \x[magnetism] is just a consenquence of \x[special-relativity].

= Charged particle moving at the same speed of electrons thought experiment
{synonym}
{title2}

This is a well known though experiment, which \x[richard-feynman] used to emphasize
* infinite wire with balanced positive and negative charges, so no net charge, but a net magnetic field
* a single charge moves parallel to wire at the same speed as the electrons

In the above experiment:
* from the wire frame, the charge feels electromagnetic force, because it is moving and there is a magnetic field
* from the single charge frame, there is still magnetic field (positive charges are moving), but the body itself is not moving, so there is no force!

The solution to this problem is \x[length-contraction]: the positive charges are length contracted and the moving electrons aren't, and therefore they are denser and therefore there is an effective charge from that frame.

\x[subtle-is-the-lord-by-abraham-pais-1982] chapter III "Relativity, the special theory" mentions that this fact and its importance (we want the laws of physics to look the same on all \x[inertial-frame]{p}, AKA \x[lorentz-covariance]) was first fully relized by \x[poincare] in 1905.

And at that same time \x[poincare] also immediately started to think about the other \x[fundamental-force] then known: \x[gravity], and off the bat realized that \x[gravitational-wave]{p} must exist. \x[general-relativity]{p} is probably just "the simplest way to make gravity \x[lorentz-covariant]".

\x[r-4] with a weird \x[dot-product]-like operation called the \x[minkowski-inner-product].

Because the \x[minkowski-inner-product] product is not \x[positive-definite], the \x[norm-induced-by-an-inner-product] is a \x[norm], and the space is not a \x[metric-space] strictly speaking.

The name given to this type of space is a \x[pseudometric-space].

{c}
{parent=minkowski-space}

This \x[form-mathematics] is not really an \x[inner-product] in the common modern definition, because it is not \x[positive-definite], only a \x[symmetric-bilinear-form].

Since that is a \x[symmetric-bilinear-form], the associated \x[matrix] is a \x[symmetric-matrix].

By default, we will use the time negative representation unless stated otherwise:
$$
\eta_{\mu\nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
but another equivalent one is to use a time positive representation:
$$
\eta_{\mu\nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
 0 & -1 &  0 &  0 \\
 0 &  0 & -1 &  0 \\
 0 &  0 &  0 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Why should I care when I can calculate new x and new time with \x[lorentz-transformation]?

Answer: it can give some qualitative intuition on what is larger/smaller happens before/after based only on arguably more intuitive geometric considerations, without requiring you to do any calculations, see e.g. \x[image-spacetime-diagram-illustrating-how-faster-than-light-travel-implies-time-travel].

= Light cone
{parent=spacetime-diagram}
{wiki}

A subset of \x[spacetime-diagram].

The key insights that it gives are:
* future and past are well defined: every reference frame sees your future in your future cone, and your past in your past cone

  Otherwise causality could be violated, and then things would go really bad, you could tell your past self to tell your past self to tell your past self to do something.

  You can only affect the outcome of events in your future cone, and you can only be affected by events in your past cone. You can't travel fast enough to affect.

  Two spacetime events with such fixed causality are called \x[timelike-separated-event]{p}.
* every other event (to right and left, known as \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p}) can be measured to happen before or after your current spacetime event by different observers.

  But that does not violate causality, because you just can't reach those spacetime points anyways to affect them.

* \x[time]
* \x[length], given by the \x[pythagorean-theorem]

However, in \x[special-relativity], neither of those are invariant separately, since space and time are mixed up together.

Instead, there is a new unified invariant: the spacetime-interval, given by:
$$c \Delta t^2 - (\Delta x ^2 + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2)$$

Note that this distance can be zero for two events separated.

Quantum mechanics is quite a broad term. Perhaps it is best to start approaching it from the division into:

* \x[relativistic-quantum-mechanics]: more advanced, and arguably "less useful"

Key experiments that could not work without quantum mechanics: \x[quantum-mechanics-experiment]{full}.

Mathematics: there are a few models of increasing precision which could all be called "quantum mechanics":
* \x[schrodinger-equation]
* \x[dirac-equation]
* \x[quantum-electrodynamics]

\x[ciro-santilli] feels that the \x[deep-tech][largest technological revolutions since the 1950's have been quantum related], and will continue to be for a while, from deeper understanding of chemistry and materials to \x[quantum-computing], understanding and controlling quantum systems is where the most interesting frontier of technology lies.

\x[nist] database for \x[spectral-line]: https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html

Let's do a sanity check.

Searching for "H" for \x[hydrogen] leads to: https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/ASD/lines1.pl?spectra=H&limits_type=0&low_w=&upp_w=&unit=1&submit=Retrieve+Data&de=0&format=0&line_out=0&en_unit=0&output=0&bibrefs=1&page_size=15&show_obs_wl=1&show_calc_wl=1&unc_out=1&order_out=0&max_low_enrg=&show_av=2&max_upp_enrg=&tsb_value=0&min_str=&A_out=0&intens_out=on&max_str=&allowed_out=1&forbid_out=1&min_accur=&min_intens=&conf_out=on&term_out=on&enrg_out=on&J_out=on

From there we can see for example the 1 to 2 lines:
* 1s to 2p: 121.5673644608 nm
* 1s to 2: 121.56701 nm TODO what does that $2$ mean?
* 1s to 2s: 121.5673123130200 TODO what does that mean?

We see that the table is sorted from lower from level first and then by upper level second.

So it is good to see that we are in the same 121nm ballpark as mentioned at \x[hydrogen-spectral-line].

TODO why I can't see 2s to 2p transitions there to get the \x[fine-structure]?

One reasonable and memorable approximation excluding any \x[fine-structure] is:

which with \x[planck-einstein-relation] gives about 121.6 \x[nm] ($2.47 \times 10^15$ \x[hz]), which is a reasonable match with the value of 121.567... from the \x[nist-atomic-spectra-database].

http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~blackman/ast104/zeeman-split.html contains the hello world that everyone should know: 2p splits into 3 energy levels, so you see 3 spectral lines from 1s to 2p rather than just one.

{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

The discovery of the \x[photon] was one of the major initiators of quantum mechanics.

Light was very well known to be a wave through \x[diffraction] experiments. So how could it also be a particle???

This was a key development for people to eventually notice that the \x[electron] is also a wave.

This process "started" in 1900 with \x[planck-s-law] which was based on discrete energy packets being exchanged as exposed at \x[on-the-theory-of-the-energy-distribution-law-of-the-normal-spectrum-by-max-planck-1900].

This ideas was reinforced by \x[einstein]'s explanation of the \x[photoelectric-effect] in 1905 in terms of \x[photon].

In the next big development was the \x[bohr-model] in 1913, which supposed non-\x[classical-physics] new quantization rules for the \x[electron] which explained the \x[hydrogen-emission-spectrum]. The quantization rule used made use of the \x[planck-constant], and so served an initial link between the emerging quantized nature of \x[light], and that of the \x[electron].

The final phase started in 1923, when \x[louis-de-broglie] proposed that in analogy to photons, \x[electron]{p} might also be waves, a statement made more precise through the \x[de-broglie-relations].

This event opened the floodgates, and soon \x[matrix-mechanics] was published in \x[quantum-mechanical-re-interpretation-of-kinematic-and-mechanical-relations-by-heisenberg-1925], as the first coherent formulation of \x[quantum-mechanics].

It was followed by the \x[schrodinger-equation] in 1926, which proposed an equivalent \x[partial-differential-equation] formulation to \x[matrix-mechanics], a mathematical formulation that was more familiar to \x[physicist]{p} than the matrix ideas of Heisenberg.

= Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

These are the key mathematical ideas to understand!!

There are actually a few formulations out there. By far the dominant one as of 2020 has been the \x[schrodinger-picture], which contrasts notably with the \x[heisenberg-picture].

Another well known one is the \x[de-broglie-bohm-theory], which is deterministic, but \x[non-local].

= Schrödinger picture
{c}
{parent=mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics}

The state of a quantum system is a vector of unit length in a \x[hilbert-space]. TODO why Hilbert Space.

"Making a measurement" for an \x[observable] means applying a \x[self-adjoint-operator] to the state, and after a measurement is done:
* the state collapses to an \x[eigenvector] of the self adjoint operator
* the result of the measurement is the \x[eigenvalue] of the self adjoint operator
* the probability of a given result happening when the spectrum is \x[discrete] is proportional to the modulus of the projection on that eigenvector.

  For continuous spectra such as that of the \x[position-operator] in most systems, e.g. \x[schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle], the projection on each individual eigenvalue is zero, i.e. the probability of one absolutely exact position is zero. To get a non-zero result, measurement has to be done on a continuous range of eigenvectors (e.g. for position: "is the particle present between x=0 and x=1?"), and you have to integrate the probability over the projection on a continuous range of eigenvalues.

  In such continuous cases, the probability collapses to an uniform distribution on the range after measurement.

  The continuous position operator case is well illustrated at: \x[video-visualization-of-quantum-physics-quantum-mechanics-by-udiprod-2017]
Those last two rules are also known as the \x[born-rule].

Self adjoint operators are chosen because they have the following key properties:
* their eigenvalues form an orthonormal basis
* they are diagonalizable

See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics

Perhaps the easiest case to understand this for is that of \x[spin-physics], which has only a finite number of eigenvalues. Although it is a shame that fully understanding that requires a \x[special-relativity][relativistic] quantum theory such as the \x[dirac-equation].

The next steps are to look at simple 1D bound states such as \x[particle-in-a-box] and \x[quantum-harmonic-oscillator].

This naturally generalizes to \x[schrodinger-equation-solution-for-the-hydrogen-atom].

The solution to the \x[schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle] is a bit harder since the possible energies do not make up a \x[countable-set].

This formulation was apparently called more precisely \x[dirac-von-neumann-axioms], but it because so dominant we just call it "the" formulation.

\x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-notes-by-david-tong-2007] mentions that:
\Q[if you were to write the wavefunction in quantum field theory, it would be a functional, that is a function of every possible configuration of the field $\phi$.]

= Bra-ket notation
{parent=mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics}
{wiki=Bra–ket_notation}

= Bra-ket
{synonym}

Notation used in \x[quantum-mechanics].

Ket is just a \x[vector-mathematics]. Though generally in the context of \x[quantum-mechanics], this is an infinite dimensional vector in a \x[hilbert-space] like \x[l2].

Bra is just the \x[dual-vector] corresponding to a ket, or in other words \x[projection-mathematics] \x[linear-operator], i.e. a linear function which can act on a given vector and returns a single \x[complex-number]. Also known as... \x[dot-product].

For example:
$$
(\bra{x}) \ket{y}
$$
is basically a fancy way of saying:
$$
x \cdot y
$$
that is: we are taking the projection of $y$ along the $x$ direction. Note that in the ordinary dot product notation however, we don't differentiate as clearly what is a vector and what is an operator, while the bra-ket notation makes it clear.

The projection operator is completely specified by the vector that we are projecting it on. This is why the bracket notation makes sense.

It also has the merit of clearly differentiating vectors from operators. E.g. it is not very clear in $x \cdot y$ that $x$ is an operator and $y$ is a vector, except due to the relative position to the dot. This is especially bad when we start manipulating operators by themselves without vectors.

This notation is widely used in \x[quantum-mechanics] because calculating the \x[probability] of getting a certain outcome for an experiment is calculated by taking the projection of a state on one an \x[eigenvalue] basis vector as explained at: \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics]{full}.

Making the projection operator "look like a thing" (the bra) is nice because we can add and multiply them much like we can for vectors (they also form a \x[vector-space]), e.g.:
$$
\bra{x} + \bra{y}
$$
just means taking the projection along the $x + y$ direction.

\x[ciro-santilli] thinks that this notation is a bit over-engineered. Notably the bra's are just vectors, which we should just write as usual with $\va{v}$... the bra thing makes it look scarier than it needs to be. And then we should just find a different notation for the projection part.

Maybe \x[dirac] chose it because of the appeal of the women's piece of clothing: \x[bra], in an irresistible call from \x[british-humour].

But in any case, alas, we are now stuck with it.

{c}
{parent=non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

The \x[partial-differential-equation] of \x[special-relativity][non-relativistic] \x[quantum-mechanics].

Experiments explained:
* via the \x[schrodinger-equation-solution-for-the-hydrogen-atom] it predicts:
  * \x[spectral-line] basic lines, plus \x[zeeman-effect]
* \x[schrodinger-equation-solution-for-the-helium-atom]: perturbative solutions give good approximations to the energy levels
* \x[double-slit-experiment]: I think we have a closed solution for the max and min probabilities on the measurement wall, and they match experiments

Experiments not explained: those that the \x[dirac-equation] explains like:
* \x[fine-structure]
* \x[spontaneous-emission] coefficients

To get some intuition on the equation on the consequences of the equation, have a look at:
* \x[schrodinger-equation-simulations]
* \x[solutions-of-the-schrodinger-equation]

The easiest to understand case of the equation which you must have in mind initially that of the \x[schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle].

Then, with that in mind, the general form of the \x[schrodinger-equation] is:
$$i\hbar\pdv{\psi(\vv{x}, t)}{t} = \hat{H}[\psi(\vv{x}, t)]$$
{title=Schrodinger equation}
where:
* $\hbar$ is the \x[reduced-planck-constant]
* $\psi$ is the \x[wave-function]
* $t$ is the time
* $\hat{H}$ is a \x[linear-operator] called the \x[hamiltonian]. It takes as input a function $\psi$, and returns another function. This plays a role analogous to the Hamiltonian in \x[classical-mechanics]: determining it determines what the physical system looks like, and how the system evolves in time, because we can just plug it into the equation and solve it. It basically encodes the total energy and forces of the system.

The $\vv{x}$ argument of $\psi$ could be anything, e.g.:
* we could have preferred \x[polar-coordinate]{p} instead of linear ones if the potential were symmetric around a point
* we could have more than one particle, e.g. \x[solutions-of-the-schrodinger-equation-for-two-electrons], which would have e.g. $x_1$ and $x_2$ for different particles. No matter how many particles there are, we have just a single $\psi$, we just add more arguments to it.
* we could have even more generalized coordinates. This is much in the spirit of \x[hamiltonian-mechanics] or \x[generalized-coordinate]{p}
Note however that there is always a single magical $t$ time variable. This is needed in particular because there is a time \x[partial-derivative] in the equation, so there must be a corresponding time variable in the function. This makes the equation explicitly \x[non-relativistic].

The general \x[schrodinger-equation] can be broken up into a trivial time-dependent and a \x[time-independent-schrodinger-equation] by separation of variables. So in practice, all we need to solve is the slightly simpler \x[time-independent-schrodinger-equation], and the full equation comes out as a result.

Existence and uniqueness: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/212913/existence-and-uniqueness-for-two-dimensional-time-dependent-schr%C3%B6dinger-equation

= Time-independent Schrodinger equation
{parent=schrodinger-equation}
{wiki=Schrödinger_equation#Time-independent_equation}

As shown at https://quantummechanics.ucsd.edu/ph130a/130_notes/node124.html[] from \x[quantum-physics-by-jim-branson-2003], using \x[separation-of-variables] we can break up the general \x[schrodinger-equation] into:
* a time-only part that does not depend on space and does not depend on the potential
* a space-only part that does not depend on time:

  $$\hat{H}[\psi(\vv{x})] = E \psi{\vv{x}}$$
  {title=Time-independent Schrodinger equation}

  Since this is the only non-trivial part, unlike the time part which is trivial, this spacial part is just called "the time-independent Schrodinger equation".

  Note that the $\psi$ here is not the same as the $\psi$ in the \x[equation-schrodinger-equation][time-dependent Schrodinger equation] of course, as that psi is the result of the multiplication of the time and space parts. This is a bit of imprecise terminology, but hey, physics.

The key initial example to have in mind is the \x[time-independent-schrodinger-equation-for-a-free-one-dimensional-particle].

It is interesting to note that the time-independent Schrodinger equation can also be seen exactly as an \x[eigenvalue] equation, since the value of the energy `E` can be any fixed value that can satisfy the \x[boundary-condition]{p} conditions imposed. The only difference from usual \x[matrix] \x[eigenvector]{p} is that we are now dealing with an \x[infinite-dimensional] vector space.

Then, just like in \x[solving-partial-differential-equations-with-the-fourier-series] of the \x[heat-equation], the boundary conditions may make it so that only certain \x[discrete] values of `E` are possible solutions.

Then, the time part o the equation can be solved explicitly in the general case, as it does not depend on the potential $V(x)$, and it is just an exponential.

Therefore, all we need to do to solve the general Schrodinger equation is to solve the time-independent version, and then decompose the initial condition in terms of it like as done in \x[solving-partial-differential-equations-with-the-fourier-series]{full}.

Furthermore:
* we immediately see from the equation that the time-independent solutions are states of deterministic energy because the energy is an \x[eigenvalue] of the Hamiltonian operator
* the probability density of such a state does not change with time because the exponential time part cancels out on the conjugate

We select for the general \x[equation-schrodinger-equation]:

Now, there are two ways to go about this.

The first is the stupid "here's a guess" + "hey this family of solutions forms a \x[complete-basis]"! This is exactly how we solved the problem at \x[solving-partial-differential-equations-with-the-fourier-series]{full}, except that now the complete basis are the \x[hermite-functions].

And then we can prove the ladder properties easily.

As mentioned at \x[david-tong-s-2009-quantum-field-theory-lectures-at-the-perimeter-institute/lecture-1] https://youtube.com/watch?video=H3AFzbrqH68&t=555[], \x[special-relativity][relativistic] quantum mechanical theories like the \x[dirac-equation] and \x[klein-gordon-equation] make no sense for a "single particle": they must imply that particles can pop in out of existence.

The wave equation contains the entire state of a particle.

From \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics] remember that the wave equation is a vector in \x[hilbert-space].

And a single vector can be represented in many different ways in different basis, and two of those ways happen to be the position and the momentum representations.

More importantly, position and momentum are first and foremost operators associated with observables: the \x[position-operator] and the \x[momentum-operator]. And both of their eigenvalue sets form a basis of the \x[hilbert-space] according to the \x[spectral-theorem].

When you represent a wave equation as a function, you have to say what the variable of the function means. And depending on weather you say "it means position" or "it means momentum", the position and momentum operators will be written differently.

This is well shown at: \x[video-visualization-of-quantum-physics-quantum-mechanics-by-udiprod-2017].

Furthermore, the position and momentum representations are equivalent: one is the \x[fourier-transform] of the other: \x[position-and-momentum-space]. Remember that notably we can always take the Fourier transform of a function in \x[l2] due to \x[carleson-s-theorem].

Then the uncertainty principle follows immediately from a general property of the Fourier transform: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fourier_transform&oldid=961707157#Uncertainty_principle

In precise terms, the \x[uncertainty-principle] talks about the \x[standard-deviation] of two measures.

We can visualize the uncertainty principle more intuitively by thinking of a \x[wave-function] that is a \x[real-number][real] \x[flat-top-bump-function] with a flat top in \x[1d]. We can then change the width of the support, but when we do that, the top goes higher to keep probability equal to 1. The momentum is 0 everywhere, except in the edges of the support. Then:
* to localize the wave in space at position 0 to reduce the space uncertainty, we have to reduce the support. However, doing so makes the momentum variation on the edges more and more important, as the slope will go up and down faster (higher top, and less x space for descent), leading to a larger variance (note that average momentum is still 0, due to to symmetry of the bump function)
* to localize the momentum as much as possible at 0, we can make the support wider and wider. This makes the bumps at the edges smaller and smaller. However, this also obviously delocalises the wave function more and more, increasing the variance of x

= Position and momentum space
{parent=uncertainty-principle}
{wiki}

One of the main reasons why physicists are obsessed by this topic is that position and momentum are mapped to the \x[phase-space-coordinate]{p} of \x[hamiltonian-mechanics], which appear in the \x[matrix-mechanics] formulation of \x[quantum-mechanics], which offers insight into the theory, particularly when generalizing to \x[relativistic-quantum-mechanics].

One way to think is: what is the definition of space space? It is a way to write the wave function $\psi_x(x)$ such that:
* the position operator is the multiplication by $x$
* the momentum operator is the derivative by $x$
And then, what is the definition of momentum space? It is of course a way to write the wave function $\psi_p(p)$ such that:
* the momentum operator is the multiplication by $p$

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/39442/intuitive-explanation-of-why-momentum-is-the-fourier-transform-variable-of-posit/39508#39508 gives the best idea intuitive idea: the \x[fourier-transform] writes a function as a (continuous) sum of plane waves, and each plane wave has a fixed momentum.

{parent=position-and-momentum-space}

A way to write the wavefunction $\psi(x)$ such that the \x[position-operator] is:
$$x$$
i.e., a function that takes the wavefunction as input, and outputs another function:
$$x \psi(x)$$

If you believe that \x[mathematician]{p} took care of \x[continuous-spectrum-functional-analysis] for us and that everything just works, the most concrete and direct thing that this representation tells us is that:
\Q[the probability of finding a particle between $x_0$ and $x_1$ at time $t$]
equals:
$$\int_{x_0}^{x_1}x \psi{x, t} dx$$

= Position operator
{parent=position-and-momentum-space}

This operator case is surprisingly not necessarily mathematically trivial to describe formally because you often end up getting into the \x[dirac-delta-function]{p}/continuous spectrum: as mentioned at: \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics]

{parent=position-and-momentum-space}
{wiki}

One dimension in \x[position-representation]:
$$
\hat{p} = - i \hbar \pdv{}{x}
$$

In three dimensions In position representation, we define it by using the \x[gradient], and so we see that 
$$
\hat{p} = - i \hbar \pdv{}{x}
$$

There is also a time-energy \x[uncertainty-principle], because those two operators are also \x[complementarity-physics][complementary].

= Angular momentum operator
{parent=uncertainty-principle}
{wiki}

Basically the operators are just analogous to the classical ones e.g. the classical:
$$L_z = x p_y - y p_x$$
becomes:
$$\hat{L}_z = -i \hbar \left( x\pdv{}{y} - y\pdv{}{x} \right)$$

Besides the angular momentum in each direction, we also have the \x[total-angular-momentum]:
$$\hat{L}^2 = \hat{L}_x + \hat{L}_y + \hat{L}_z$$

Then you have to understand what each one of those does to the each \x[atomic-orbital]:
* total angular momentum: determined by the \x[azimuthal-quantum-number]
* angular momentum in one direction ($z$ by convention): determined by the \x[magnetic-quantum-number]

There is an \x[uncertainty-principle] between the x, y and z angular momentums, we can only measure one of them with certainty at a time. \x[video-quantum-mechanics-7a-angular-momentum-i-by-viascience-2013] justifies this intuitively by mentioning that this is analogous to \x[precession]: if you try to measure electrons e.g. with the \x[zeeman-effect] the precess on the other directions which you end up modifing.

This is in contrast to classical mechanics where e.g. the state of mechanical system is given by two real functions: position and speed.

Relates particle momentum and its wavelength, or equivalently, energy and frequency.

The wavelength relation is:
$$
\lambda = \frac{h}{p}
$$
but since:
$$
v = \lambda f
E = p v
$$
the wavelength relation implies:
$$
\frac{v}{f} = \frac{h}{p}
f = \frac{v p}{h}  = \frac{E}{h}
$$

Particle wavelength can be for example measured very directly on a \x[double-slit-experiment].

So if we take for example electrons of different speeds, we should be able to see the diffraction pattern change accordingly.

Published by \x[werner-heisenberg] in 1925-07-25 as \x[quantum-mechanical-re-interpretation-of-kinematic-and-mechanical-relations-by-heisenberg-1925], it offered the first general formulation of quantum mechanics.

It is apparently more closely related to the \x[ladder-operator] method, which is a more \x[algebraic] than the more \x[analytical] \x[schrodinger-equation].

It appears that this formulation makes the importance of the \x[poisson-bracket] clear, and explains why \x[physicist]{p} are so obsessed with talking about \x[position-and-momentum-space].

And analogously for matter, appears in the \x[de-broglie-relations] relating momentum and frequency. Also appears in the \x[schrodinger-equation], basically as a consequence/cause of the de Broglie relations most likely.

Intuitively, the \x[planck-constant] determines at what length scale do quantum effects start to show up for a given energy scale. It is because the Plank constant is very small that we don't perceive quantum effects on everyday energy/length/time scales. On the $\lim_{h \to 0}$, quantum mechanics disappears entirely.

= Derivation of the Dirac equation
{parent=dirac-equation}

The \x[dirac-equation] can be derived basically "directly" from the \x[representation-theory-of-the-lorentz-group] for the \x[spin-half] representation, this is shown for example at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] 6.3 "Dirac Equation".

The Diract equation is the \x[spacetime-symmetry] part of the \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian], i.e. is describes how \x[spin-half] particles behave without interactions. The full \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian] can then be reached by adding the \x[u-1] \x[internal-symmetry].

As mentioned at \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics], this same method allows us to analogously derive the equations for other \x[spin-number]{p}.

$$
\partial_i \partial^i \psi - m^2 \psi = 0
$$

Has some issues which are solved by the \x[dirac-equation]:
* it has a second time derivative of the \x[wave-function]. Therefore, to solve it we must specify not only the initial value of the wave equation, but also the derivative of the wave equation, 

  As mentioned at \x[advanced-quantum-mechanics-by-freeman-dyson-1951] and further clarified at: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/340023/cant-the-negative-probabilities-of-klein-gordon-equation-be-avoided[], this would lead to negative probabilities.
* the modulus of the wave function is not constant and therefore not always one, and therefore cannot be interpreted as a probability density anymore
* since we are working with the square of the energy, we have both positive and negative value solutions. This is also a features of the \x[dirac-equation] however.

= Derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation
{c}
{parent=klein-gordon-equation}

The Klein-Gordon equation directly uses a more naive \x[relativistic-energy] guess of $p^2 + m^2$ squared.

But since this is \x[quantum-mechanics], we feel like making $p$ into the "\x[momentum-operator]", just like in the \x[schrodinger-equation].

But we don't really know how to apply the momentum operator twice, because it is a \x[gradient], so the first application goes from a scalar field to the vector field, and the second one...

So we just cheat and try to use the \x[laplace-operator] instead because there's some squares on it:
$$
H = \laplacian{} + m^2
$$

But then, we have to avoid taking the square root to reach a first derivative in time, because we don't know how to take the square root of that operator expression.

So the Klein-Gordon equation just takes the approach of using this squared Hamiltonian instead.

Since it is a Hamiltonian, and comparing it to the \x[schrodinger-equation] which looks like:
$$
H \psi = i \pdv{\psi}{t}
$$
taking the Hamiltonian twice leads to:
$$
H^2 \psi = - \pdv{^2 \psi}{^2 t}
$$

We can contrast this with the \x[dirac-equation], which instead attempts to explicitly construct an operator which squared coincides with the relativistic formula: \x[derivation-of-the-dirac-equation].

= Spin
{disambiguate=physics}
{parent=dirac-equation}

Spin is one of the \x[defining-properties-of-elementary-particles], i.e. number that describes how an \x[elementary-particle] behaves, much like \x[electric-charge] and \x[mass].

Possible values are half integer numbers: 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and so on.

The approach shown in this section: \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics]{c}{full} shows what the spin number actually means in general. As shown there, the spin number it is a direct consequence of having the laws of nature be \x[lorentz-invariant]. Different spin numbers are just different ways in which this can be achieved as per different \x[representation-of-the-lorentz-group].

\x[video-quantum-mechanics-9a-photon-spin-and-schrodinger-s-cat-i-by-viascience-2013] explains nicely how:
* incorporated into the \x[dirac-equation] as a natural consequence of \x[special-relativity] corrections, but not naturally present in the \x[schrodinger-equation], see also: \x[the-dirac-equation-predicts-spin]{child}
* \x[photon] spin can be either linear or circular
* the linear one can be made from a superposition of circular ones
* straight antennas produce linearly polarized photos, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helical_antenna[Helical antennas] circularly polarized ones
* a jump between 2s and 2p in an atom changes angular momentum. Therefore, the photon must carry angular momentum as well as energy.
* cannot be classically explained, because even for a very large estimate of the electron size, its surface would have to spin faster than light to achieve that magnetic momentum with the known \x[electron-charge]
* as shown at \x[video-quantum-mechanics-12b-dirac-equation-ii-by-viascience-2015], observers in different \x[frame-of-reference][frames of reference] see different spin states

{title2}

Theoretical framework on which quantum field theories are based, theories based on framework include:
* \x[quantum-electrodynamics]
* \x[quantum-chromodynamics]
so basically the entire \x[standard-model]

The basic idea is that there is a field for each particle particle type.

E.g. in QED, one for the \x[electron] and one for the \x[photon]: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/166709/are-electron-fields-and-photon-fields-part-of-the-same-field-in-qed[].

And then those fields interact with some \x[lagrangian].

One way to look at QFT is to split it into two parts:
* deriving the Lagrangians of the \x[standard-model]: \x[why-do-symmetries-such-as-su-3-su-2-and-u-1-matter-in-particle-physics]. This is the easier part, since the lagrangians themselves can be understood with not very advanced mathematics, and derived beautifully from symmetry constraints
* the qantization of fields. This is the hard part \x[ciro-santilli] is unable to understand, TODO \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-field-theory].
Then interwined with those two is the part "OK, how to solve the equations, if they are solvable at all", which is an open problem: \x[yang-mills-existence-and-mass-gap].

There appear to be two main equivalent formulations of quantum field theory:
* \x[second-quantization]

But what the heck is the mathematical model for a quantum field theory? TODO someone was saying it is equivalent to an infinite set of PDEs somehow. Investigate. Related:

The \x[path-integral-formulation] might actually be the most understandable formulation, as shown at \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].

The formulation of QFT also appears to be a form of infinite-dimentional calculus.

\x[quantum-electrodynamics-by-lifshitz-et-al-2nd-edition-1982] chapter 1. "The uncertainty principle in the relativistic case" contains an interesting idea:
\Q[The foregoing discussion suggests that the theory will not consider the time dependence of particle interaction processes. It will show that in these processes there are no characteristics precisely definable (even within the usual limitations of quantum mechanics); the description of such a process as occurring in the course of time is therefore just as unreal as the classical paths are in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The only observable quantities are the properties (momenta,
polarizations) of free particles: the initial particles which come into interaction, and the final particles which result from the process.]

This one might actually be understandable! It is what \x[richard-feynman] starts to explain at: \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].

The difficulty is then proving that the total probability remains at 1, and maybe causality is hard too.

The path integral formulation can be seen as a generalization of the \x[double-slit-experiment] to infinitely many slits.

Feynman first stared working it out for \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics], with the relativistic goal in mind, and only later on he attained the relativistic goal.

TODO why intuitively did he take that approach? Likely is makes it easier to add \x[special-relativity].

* 3 https://youtu.be/1baiIxKKQlQ?list=PL613A31A706529585&t=728 the original example of a \x[local-symmetry] was \x[general-relativity], and that in that context it can be clearly seen that the local symmetry is what causes "forces" to appear
  * https://youtu.be/1baiIxKKQlQ?list=PL613A31A706529585&t=933 \x[local-symmetry] gives a conserved current. In the case of \x[electromagnetism], this is electrical current. This was the only worthwhile thing he sad to 2021 Ciro. Summarized at: \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents].
* 4 https://youtu.be/5ljKcWm7hoU?list=PL613A31A706529585&t=427 \x[electromagnetism] has both a global symmetry (\x[special-relativity]) but also \x[local-symmetry], which leads to the conservation of charge current and forces.

  \x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-by-tobias-osborne-2017/lecture-3] properly defines a \x[local-symmetry] in terms of the context of the \x[lagrangian-density], and explains that the conservation of currents there is basically the statement of \x[noether-s-theorem] in that context.

Theory that describes \x[electron]{p} and \x[photon]{p} really well, and \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979][as Feynman puts it] "accounts very precisely for all physical phenomena we have ever observed, except for gravity and nuclear physics" ("including the laughter of the crowd" ;-)).

Learning it is one of \x[ciro-santilli]'s main intellectual \x[fetish]{p}.

While Ciro acknowledges that QED is intrinsically challenging due to the wide range or requirements (\x[quantum-mechanics], \x[special-relativity] and \x[electromagnetism]), Ciro feels that there is a glaring gap in this moneyless market for a learning material that follows the \x[middle-way] as mentioned at: \x[the-missing-link-between-basic-and-advanced]. \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979] is one of the best attempts so far, but it falls a bit too close to the superficial side of things, if only Feynman hadn't assumed that the audience doesn't know any mathematics...

The funny thing is that when \x[ciro-santilli-s-mother] retired, learning it (or as she put it: "how photons and electrons interact") was also one of her retirement plans. She is a pharmacist by training, and doesn't know much \x[mathematics], and her \x[english-language] was \x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world][somewhat limited]. Oh, she also wanted to learn how \x[photosynthesis] works (possibly not fully understood by science as that time, 2020). Ambitious old lady!!!

Experiments: \x[quantum-electrodynamics-experiments].

Combines \x[special-relativity] with more classical \x[quantum-mechanics], but further generalizing the \x[dirac-equation], which also does that: \x[dirac-equation-vs-quantum-electrodynamics].

Before QED, the most advanced theory was that of the \x[dirac-equation], which was already relativistic but TODO what was missing there exactly?

As summarized at: https://youtube.com/watch?v=_AZdvtf6hPU?t=305[] Quantum Field Theory lecture at the African Summer Theory Institute 1 of 4 by Anthony Zee (2004):
* classical mechanics describes large and slow objects
* special relativity describes large and fast objects (they are getting close to the speed of light, so we have to consider relativity)
* classical \x[quantum-mechanics] describes small and slow objects.
* QED describes objects that are both small and fast

That video also mentions the interesting idea that:
* in special relativity, we have the \x[mass-energy-equivalence]
* in quantum mechanics, thinking along the \x[time-energy-uncertainty-principle], $\Delta E \sim \frac{1}{\Delta t}$
Therefore, for small timescales, energy can vary a lot. But mass is equivalent to energy. Therefore, for small time scale, particles can appear and disappear wildly.

QED is the first \x[quantum-field-theory] fully developed. That framework was later extended to also include the \x[weak-interaction] and \x[strong-interaction]. As a result, it is perhaps easier to just \x[google] for "Quantum Field Theory" if you want to learn QED, since QFT is more general and has more resources available generally.

Like in more general quantum field theory, there is on field for each particle type. In quantum field theory, there are only two fields to worry about:
* \x[photon] field
* \x[electromagnetism] field

where:
* $F$ is the \x[electromagnetic-tensor]

Note that this is the sum of the:
* \x[dirac-lagrangian], which  only describes the "inertia of bodies" part of the equation
* the \x[electromagnetic] interaction term ${1 \over 4\mu_0} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}$, which describes term describes forces
Note that the relationship between $\psi$ and $F$ is not explicit. However, if we knew what type of particle we were talking about, e.g. \x[electron], then the knowledge of \x[psi] would also give the charge distribution and therefore $F$

As mentioned at the beginning of \x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-notes-by-david-tong-2007]:

* add the \x[u-1] \x[internal-symmetry] to add interactions, which reaches the full equation

\Video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFRyN3fQMO8]
{title=Deriving the \x[qed-lagrangian] by \x[dietterich-labs] (2018)}
{description=As mentioned at the start of the video, he starts with the \x[dirac-equation] Lagrangian derived in a previous video. It has nothing to do with \x[electromagnetism] specifically.

He notes that that \x[dirac-lagrangian], besides being globally \x[lorentz-invariant], it also also has a global \x[u-1] invariance.

However, it does not have a local invariance if the \x[u-1] transformation depends on the point in spacetime.

He doesn't mention it, but I think this is highly desirable, because in general \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents], and in this case we want conservation of charges.

To fix that, he adds an extra \x[gauge-field] $A_\mu$ (a field of $4 \times 4$ matrices) to the regular derivative, and the resulting derivative has a fancy name: the \x[covariant-derivative].

Then finally he notes that this \x[gauge-field] he had to add has to transform exactly like the \x[electromagnetic-four-potential]!

So he uses that as the gauge, and also adds in the \x[maxwell-lagrangian] in the same go. It is kind of a guess, but it is a natural guess, and it turns out to be correct.

= What does it mean that photons are force carriers for electromagnetism?
{parent=quantum-electrodynamics}

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/61095/photon-as-the-carrier-of-the-electromagnetic-force

TODO find/create decent answer.

I think the best answer is something along:
* \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents]. $U(1)$ gives conserved charges.
* OK now. We want a local $U(1)$ symmetry. And we also want:
  * \x[dirac-equation]: quantum relativistic Newton's laws that specify what forces do to the fields
  * \x[electromagnetism]: specifies what causes forces based on currents. But not what it does to masses.
  Given all of that, the most obvious and direct thing we reach a guess at the \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian] is \x[video-deriving-the-qed-lagrangian-by-dietterich-labs-2018]

A basic non-precise intuition is that a good model of reality is that electrons do not "interact with one another directly via the electromagnetic field".

A better model happens to be the \x[quantum-field-theory] view that the electromagnetic field interacts with the photon field but not directly with itself, and then the photon field interacts with parts of the electromagnetic field further away.

The more precise statement is that the \x[photon-field] is a gauge field of the electromagnetic force under local U(1) symmetry, which is described by a \x[lie-group]. TODO understand.

This idea was first applied in \x[general-relativity], where \x[einstein] understood that the "force of \x[gravity]" can be understood just in terms of symmetry and curvature of space. This was later applied o \x[quantum-electrodynamics] and the entire \x[standard-model].

From \x[video-lorenzo-sadun-on-the-yang-mills-and-mass-gap-millennium-problem]:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCQ9GIqpGBI&t=1663s mentions this idea first came about from \x[hermann-weyl].

By \x[richard-feynman]{parent}.

Talk title shown on intro: "Today's Answers to Newton's Queries about Light".

6 hour lecture, where he tries to explain it to an audience that does not know any modern physics. This is a noble effort.

Part of The Douglas Robb Memorial Lectures lecture series.

Feynman apparently also made a book adaptation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED:_The_Strange_Theory_of_Light_and_Matter[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]. That book is basically word by word the same as the presentation, including the diagrams.

According to http://www.feynman.com/science/qed-lectures-in-new-zealand/ the official upload is at http://www.vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8[] and Vega does show up as a watermark on the video (though it is too pixilated to guess without knowing it), a project that has been discontinued and has has a non-permissive license. Newbs.

4 parts:
* Part 1: is saying "\x[photon]{p} exist"
* Part 2: is amazing, and describes how photons move as a sum of all possible paths, not sure if it is relativistic at all though, and suggests that something is minimized in that calculation (the \x[action-physics])
* Part 3: is where he hopelessly tries to explain the crucial part of how electrons join the picture in a similar manner to how photons do.

  He does make the link to light, saying that there is a function $P(A, B)$ which gives the amplitude for a photon going from A to B, where A and B are spacetime events.

  And then he mentions that there is a similar function $E(A, B)$ for an electron to go from A to B, but says that that function is too complicated, and gives no intuition unlike the photon one.

  He does not mention it, but P and E are the so called \x[propagator]{p}.

  This is likely the \x[path-integral-formulation] of QED.

  On \x[quantum-mechanical-view-of-reality-by-richard-feynman-1983] he mentions that $E$ is a \x[bessel-function], without giving further detail.

  And also mentions that:
  $$
  E = f(1, 2, m) \\
  P = f(1, 2, 0)
  $$
  where `m` is basically a scale factor.
  such that both are very similar. And that something similar holds for many other particles.

  And then, when you draw a \x[feynman-diagram], e.g. electron emits photon and both are detected at given positions, you sum over all the possibilities, each amplitude is given by:
  $$
  c \times E(A, D) \times E(D, B) \times P(B, C)
  $$
  summed over all possible $D$ \x[spacetime] points.

  This is basically well said at: https://youtu.be/rZvgGekvHes?t=3349 from \x[quantum-mechanical-view-of-reality-by-richard-feynman-1983].

  TODO: how do electron velocities affect where they are likely to end up? $E(A, D)$ suggests the probability only depends on the spacetime points.

  Also, this clarifies why computations in QED are so insane: you have to sum over every possible point in space!!! TODO but then how do we calculate anything at all in practice?
* Part 4: known problems with QED and thoughts on QCD. Boring.
This talk has the merit of being very experiment oriented on part 2, big kudos: \x[how-to-teach-and-learn-physics]

Explains \x[beta-decay]. TODO why/how.

Maybe a good view of why this force was needed given \x[beta-decay] experiments is: in beta decay, a \x[neutron] is getting split up into an \x[electron] and a \x[proton]. Therefore, those charges must be contained inside the neutron somehow to start with. But then what could possibly make a positive and a negative particle separate?
* the \x[electromagnetic-force] should hold them together
* the \x[strong-force] seems to hold positive charges together. Could it then be pushing opposite-charges apart? Why not?
* \x[gravity] is too weak

http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/Weak-nuclear-force.html gives a quick and dirty:
\Q[
Beta decay could not be explained by the strong nuclear force, the force that's responsible for holding the atomic nucleus together, because this force doesn't affect electrons. It couldn't be explained by the electromagnetic force, because this does not affect \x[neutron]{p}, and the force of \x[gravity] is far too weak to be responsible. Since this new atomic force was not as strong as the strong nuclear force, it was dubbed the weak nuclear force.

\Q[
While the photon 'carries' charge, and therefore mediates the \x[electromagnetic-force], the \x[z-boson][Z] and \x[w-boson][W] \x[boson]{p} are said to carry a property known as 'weak isospin'. \x[w-boson]{p} mediate the weak force when particles with charge are involved, and \x[z-boson]{p} mediate the weak force when neutral particles are involved.

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/106392/internal-and-spacetime-symmetries

The different only shows up for \x[field-physics], not with particles. For fields, there are two types of changes that we can make that can keep the \x[lagrangian] unchanged as mentioned at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter "4.5.2 Noether's Theorem for Field Theories - Spacetime":
* \x[spacetime-symmetry]: act with the \x[poincare-group] on the \x[four-vector] spacetime inputs of the field itself, i.e. transforming $L(\Phi(x), \partial \Phi(x), dx)$ into $L(\Phi'(x'), \partial \Phi'(x'), x')$
* \x[internal-symmetry]: act on the output of the  field, i.e.: $L(\Phi(x) + \delta \Phi(x), \partial (\Phi(x) + \delta \Phi(x)), x)$

From \x[defining-properties-of-elementary-particles]:
* spacetime:
  * \x[mass]
  * \x[spin-physics]
* internal
  * \x[electric-charge]
  * \x[weak-charge]
  * \x[color-charge]

From the spacetime theory alone, we can derive the \x[lagrangian] for the free theories for each \x[spin-physics]:
* \x[spin-0]: \x[klein-gordon-equation]
* \x[spin-half]: \x[dirac-equation]
* \x[spin-1]: \x[proca-equation]
Then the internal symmetries are what add the interaction part of the \x[lagrangian], which then completes the \x[standard-model-lagrangian].

Author affiliation: University of California, Santa Barbara.

Don't redistribute clause, and final version by Cambridge University Press, alas, so corrections will never be merged back: http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~mark/qft.html[]. But at least he's collecing erratas for the published (and therefore draft) versions there.

The book is top-level organized in spin 0, spin half, and spin 1. Quite ominous, really.

The preface states that one of its pedagogical philosophies is to "Illustration of the basic concepts with the simplest examples.", so maybe there is hope after all.

Non-relativistic \x[qft] is a limit of relativistic QFT, and can be used to describe for example \x[condensed-matter-physics] systems at very low temperature. But it is still very hard to make accurate measurements even in those experiments.

Defines "relativistic" as: "the \x[lagrangian] is symmetric under the \x[poincare-group]".

Mentions that "QFT is hard" because (a finite list follows???):
\Q[There are no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary \x[representation-theory][representations] of the \x[poincare-group].]
But I guess that if you fully understand what that means precisely, QTF won't be too hard for you!

Notably, this is stark contrast with rotation symmetry groups (\x[special-orthogonal-group][SO(3)]) which appears in space rotations present in \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics].

= Quantum superposition
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

Quantum superposition is really weird because it is fundamentally different than "either definite state but I don't know which", because the superposition state leads to different measurements than the non-superposition state.

Examples:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt8gVXDsh7Q "Interference in quantum mechanics" by \x[looking-glass-universe] (2015) shows how a left-right \x[spin-physics] measurement has a defined value for a superposed half up half down state, but not for a pure up state.

  TODO can this be conducted? As mentioned in the video, this is closely linked to the fact that you can describe the wave function in multiple different bases (up/down or left/right), which is also at the root of the \x[uncertainty-principle].
* \x[video-quantum-mechanics-9b-photon-spin-and-schrodinger-s-cat-ii-by-viascience-2013] gives a similar photon version
* it seems that the \x[single-particle-double-slit-experiment] can also be thought of as in terms of a superposition of "the particle goes through the right" and "the particle goes through the right", although it is a bit harder to thing about as it is not a \x[discrete] process

= Quantum entanglement
{parent=quantum-mechanics}
{wiki}

Quantum entanglement is often called spooky/surprising/unintuitive, but they key question is to understand why.

To understand that, you have to understand why it is fundamentally impossible for the entangled particle pair be in a predefined state \x[bell-test-experiment][according to experiments done] e.g. where one is deterministically yes and the other deterministically down.

In other words, why \x[local-hidden-variable-theory] is not valid.

How to generate entangled particles:
* \x[particle-decay], notably \x[pair-production]
* for \x[photon]{p}, notably: \x[spontaneous-parametric-down-conversion], e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn1sEaw1K2k "Shanni Prutchi Construction of an Entangled Photon Source" by HACKADAY (2015). Estimatd price: 5000 USD.

{synonym}

\x[ciro-santilli] finds it interesting that radioactive decay basically kickstarted the domain of \x[nuclear-physics] by essentially providing a natural \x[particle-accelerator] from a chunk of radioactive element.

The discovery process was particularly interesting, including \x[henri-becquerel]'s luck while observing \x[phosphorescence], and \x[marie-curie]'s observation that the \x[uranium] \x[ore] were more radioactive than pure uranium, and must therefore contain other even more radioactive substances, which lead to the discovery of \x[polonium] (\x[half-life] 138 days) and \x[radium] (half-life 1600 years).

= Alpha decay
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

Most of the \x[helium] in the Earth's atmosphere comes from alpha decay, since helium is lighter than air and naturally escapes out out of the atmosphere.

Wiki mentions that alpha decay is well modelled as a \x[quantum-tunnelling] event, see also \x[geiger-nuttall-law].

As a result of that law, alpha particles have relatively little energy variation around 5 MeV or a speed of about 5% of the \x[speed-of-light] for any element, because the energy is inversely exponentially proportional to \x[half-life]. This is because:
* if the energy is much larger, decay is very fast and we don't have time to study the \x[isotope]
* if the energy is much smaller, decay is very rare and we don't have enough events to observe at all

\x[uranium]{c} emits them, you can see their mass to charge ratio under magnetic field and so deduce that they are \x[electron]{p}.

Caused by \x[weak-interaction] TODO why/how.

The emitted electron kinetic energy is random from zero to a maximum value. The rest goes into a \x[neutrino]. This is how the neutrino was first discovered/observed indirectly. This is well illustrated in a \x[decay-scheme] such as \x[image-caesium-137-decay-scheme].

= Gamma ray
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

Most commonly known as a byproduct \x[radioactive-decay].

A \x[decay-scheme] such as \x[image-caesium-137-decay-scheme] illustrates well how gamma radiation happens as a byproduct of \x[radioactive-decay] due to the existence of \x[nuclear-isomer].

Gamma rays are pretty cool as they give us insight into the energy levels/different configurations of the nucleus.

They have also been used as early sources of high energy particles for \x[particle-physics] experiments before the development of \x[particle-accelerator]{p}, serving a similar purpose to \x[cosmic-ray]{p} in those early days.

But \x[gamma-ray]{p} they were more convenient in some cases because you could more easily manage them inside a \x[laboratory] rather than have to go climb some bloody mountain or a \x[balloon].

The \x[positron] for example was first observed on \x[cosmic-ray]{p}, but better confirmed in \x[gamma-ray] experiments by \x[carl-david-anderson].

= Half-life
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

The \x[half-life] of \x[radioactive-decay], which as discovered a few years before \x[quantum-mechanics] was discovered and matured, was a major mystery. Why do some nuclei fission in apparently random fashion, while others don't? How is the state of different nuclei different from one another? This is mentioned in \x[inward-bound-by-abraham-pais-1988] Chapter 6.e Why a half-life?

The term also sees use in other areas, notably \x[biology], where e.g. \x[rna]{p} spontaneously decay as part of the \x[cell]'s \x[control-system], see e.g. mentions in \x[e-coli-whole-cell-model-by-covert-lab].

Located in \x[washington-state], in a dry place the middle of the mountainous areas of the Western United states, where basically no one lives.

\x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-notes-by-david-tong-2007] puts it well:
\Q[
In classical physics, the primary reason for introducing the concept of the \x[field-physics] is to construct laws of Nature that are local. The old laws of Coulomb and Newton involve "action at a distance". This means that the force felt by an electron (or planet) changes immediately if a distant \x[proton] (or star) moves. This situation is philosophically unsatisfactory. More importantly, it is also experimentally wrong. The field theories of Maxwell and Einstein remedy the situation, with all interactions mediated in a local fashion by the field.
]
This is also mentioned e.g. at \x[video-the-quantum-experiment-that-almost-broke-locality-by-the-science-asylum-2019].

In simple terms, if you believe in the \x[schrodinger-equation] and its modern probabilistic interpretation as described in the \x[schrodinger-picture], then at first it seem that there is no strict causality to the outcome of experiments.

People have then tried to recover that by assuming that there is some inner sate beyond the \x[schrodinger-equation], but these ideas are refuted by \x[bell-test-experiment]{p}, unless we give up the \x[principle-of-locality], which feels more important, especially in \x[special-relativity], where \x[faster-than-light-implies-time-travel], which breaks causality even more dramatically.

The \x[de-broglie-bohm-theory] is a deterministic but \x[non-local] formulation of quantum mechanics.

Includes fun things like:
* \x[superconductivity] and \x[superfluidity]
* \x[semiconductor]{p}

As of 2020, this is the other "fundamental branch of physics" besides to \x[particle-physics]/\x[nuclear-physics].

Condensed matter is basically \x[chemistry] but without reactions: you study a fixed state of matter, not a reaction in which compositions change with time.

Just like in chemistry, you end up getting some very well defined substance properties due to the incredibly large number of atoms.

Just like chemistry, the ultimate goal is to do de-novo \x[computational-chemistry] to predict those properties.

And just like chemistry, what we can actually is actually very limited in part due to the exponential nature of \x[quantum-mechanics].

Also since chemistry involves reactions, chemistry puts a huge focus on liquids and solutions, which is the simplest state of matter to do reactions in.

Condensed matter however can put a lot more empasis on solids than chemistry, notably because solids are what we generally want in end products, no one likes stuff leaking right?

But it also studies liquids, e.g. notably \x[superfluidity].

One thing condensed matter is particularly obsessed with is the fascinating phenomena of \x[phase-transition].

{c}
{parent=statistical-physics}

A good conceptual starting point is to like the example that is mentioned at \x[the-harvest-of-a-century-by-siegmund-brandt-2008].

Consider a system with 2 particles and 3 states. Remember that:
* in \x[quantum-statistics] (\x[bose-einstein-statistics] and \x[fermi-dirac-statistics]), particles are indistinguishable, therefore, we might was well call both of them `A`, as opposed to `A` and `B` from non-quantum statistics
* in \x[bose-einstein-statistics], two particles may occupy the same state. In \x[fermi-dirac-statistics]

Therefore, all the possible way to put those two particles in three states are for:
* \x[maxwell-boltzmann-distribution]: both A and B can go anywhere:
  \Table[
  || State 1
  || State 2
  || State 3

  |

  | B

  |
  | B
  | A
  ]
* \x[bose-einstein-statistics]: because A and B are indistinguishable, there is now only 1 possibility for the states where A and B would be in different states.
  \Table[
  || State 1
  || State 2
  || State 3

  ]
* \x[fermi-dirac-statistics]: now states with two particles in the same state are not possible anymore:

  || State 2
  || State 3

  | A
  | A
  |

  | A
  |
  | A

  |
  | A

  ]

Both \x[bose-einstein-statistics] and \x[fermi-dirac-statistics] tend to the \x[maxwell-boltzmann-distribution] in the limit of either:
* high \x[temperature]
* low concentrations

Adds up chemical energy and kinetic energy.

Wikipedia mentions however that the kinetic energy is often negligible, even for gases.

The sum is of interest when thinking about reactions because chemical reactions can change the number of molecules involved, and therefore the pressure.

To predict if a reaction is spontaneous or not, negative enthalpy is not enough, we must also consider \x[entropy] via \x[gibbs-free-energy].

TODO understand more intuitively how that determines if a reaction happens or not.

$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S$$

At least from the formula we see that:
* the more exothermic, the more likely it is to occur
* if the entropy increases, the higher the temperature, the more likely it is to occur
  * otherwise, the lower the temperature the more likely it is to occur

A prototypical example of reaction that is exothermic but does not happen at any temperature is combustion.

I think these are the ones where $\Delta H \times \Delta S > 0$, i.e. \x[enthalpy] and \x[entropy] push the reaction in different directions. And so we can use temperature to move the \x[chemical-equilibrium] back and forward.

\x[subtle-is-the-lord-by-abraham-pais-1982] chapter 4 "Entropy and Probability" mentions well how \x[boltzmann] first thought that the second law was an actual base physical law of the universe while he was calculating numerical stuff for it, including as late as 1872.

But then he saw an argument by \x[johann-joseph-loschmidt] that given the \x[time-reversibility-of-classical-mechanics], and because they were thinking of atoms as classical balls as in the \x[kinetic-theory-of-gases], then there always exist a valid physical state where entropy decreases, by just reversing the direction of time and all particle speeds.

So from this he understood that the second law can only be probabilistic, and not a fundamental law of physics, which he published clearly in 1877.

{c}
{parent=mechanics}
{wiki}

Originally it was likely created to study constrained mechanical systems where you want to use some "custom convenient" variables to parametrize things instead of global x, y, z. Classical examples that you must have in mind include:
* \x[compound-atwood-machine]. Here, we can use the coordinates as the heights of masses relative to the \x[axle]{p} rather than absolute heights relative to the ground
* \x[double-pendulum], using two angles. The Lagrangian approach is simpler than using Newton's laws
  * \x[pendulum], use angle instead of x/y
* \x[two-body-problem], use the distance between the bodies
\x[lagrangian-mechanics-lectures-by-michel-van-biezen-2017] is a good starting point.

When doing lagrangian mechanics, we just lump together all generalized coordinates into a single vector $\va{q}(t) : \R \to \R^n$ that maps time to the full state:
$$
\va{q}(t) = [q_1(t), q_2(t), q_3(t), ..., q_n(t)]
$$
where each component can be anything, either the x/y/z coordinates relative to the ground of different particles, or angles, or nay other crazy thing we want.

The \x[lagrangian] is a function $\R^n \times \R^n \times \R \to \R$ that maps:
$$
L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)
$$
to a real number.

Then, the \x[stationary-action-principle] says that the actual path taken obeys the \x[euler-lagrange-equation]:
$$
\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{q_i} - \dv{}{t}\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{\dot{q_i}} = 0
$$
This produces a \x[system-of-partial-differential-equations] with:
* $n$ equations
* $n$ unknown functions $q_i$
* at most second order derivatives of $q_i$. Those appear because of the chain rule on the second term.

The mixture of so many derivatives is a bit mind mending, so we can clarify them a bit further. At:
$$
\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{q_i}
$$
the $q_i$ is just identifying which argument of the Lagrangian we are differentiating by: the i-th according to the order of our definition of the Lagrangian. It is not the actual function, just a mnemonic.

Then at:
$$
\dv{}{t}\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{\dot{q_i}}
$$
* the $\pdv{}{\dot{q_i}}$ part is just like the previous term, $\dot{q_i}$ just identifies the argument with index $n + i$ ($n$ because we have the $n$ non derivative arguments)
* after the partial derivative is taken and returns a new function $\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{\dot{q_i}}$, then the \x[multivariable-chain-rule] comes in and expands everything into $2n + 1$ terms

However, people later noticed that the Lagrangian had some nice properties related to \x[lie-group] continuous symmetries.

Basically it seems that the easiest way to come up with new \x[quantum-field-theory] models is to first find the Lagrangian, and then derive the equations of motion from them.

For every \x[continuous-symmetry] in the system (modelled by a \x[lie-group]), there is a corresponding conservation law: \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents].
\x[genius-richard-feynman-and-modern-physics-by-james-gleick-1994] chapter "The Best Path" mentions that \x[richard-feynman] didn't like the \x[lagrangian-mechanics] approach when he started university at \x[mit], because he felt it was too magical. The reason is that the Lagrangian approach basically starts from the principle that "nature minimizes the action across time globally". This implies that things that will happen in the future are also taken into consideration when deciding what has to happen before them! Much like the lifeguard in the \x[lifegard-problem] making global decisions about the future. However, chapter "Least Action in Quantum Mechanics" comments that Feynman later notice that this was indeed necessary while developping \x[wheeler-feynman-absorber-theory] into \x[quantum-electrodynamics], because they felt that it would make more sense to consider things that way while playing with ideas such as \x[positrons-are-electrons-travelling-back-in-time]. This is in contrast with \x[hamiltonian-mechanics], where the idea of time moving foward is more directly present, e.g. as in the \x[schrodinger-equation].

Furthermore, given the symmetry, we can calculate the derived conservation law, and vice versa.

And partly due to the above observations, it was noticed that the easiest way to describe the fundamental laws of \x[particle-physics] and make calculations with them is to first formulate their Lagrangian somehow: \x[why-do-symmetries-such-as-su-3-su-2-and-u-1-matter-in-particle-physics].

Calculus of variations is the field that searches for \x[maxima-and-minima] of \x[functional]{p}, rather than the more elementary case of functions from $\R$ to $\R$.

= Functional
{c}
{parent=calculus-of-variations}
{wiki=Euler–Lagrange equation}

A \x[function] that takes input function and outputs a \x[real-number].

= Euler-Lagrange equation
{c}
{parent=calculus-of-variations}
{wiki=Euler–Lagrange equation}

Let's start with the one dimensional case. Let the $q : \R \to \R$ and a \x[functional] $I$ defined by a function of three variables $F : \R^3 \to \R$:
$$I(q) = \int_{t_0}^{t} F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)) dt$$

Then, the \x[euler-lagrange-equation] gives the \x[maxima-and-minima] of the that type of functional. Note that this type of functional is just one very specific type of functional amongst all possible functionals that one might come up with. However, it turns out to be enough to do most of physics, so we are happy with with it.

Given $F$, the Euler-Lagrange equations are a system of \x[ordinary-differential-equation]{p} constructed from that $F$ such that the solutions to that system are the maxima/minima.

In the one dimensional case, the system has a single ordinary differential equation:
$$
\pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{q} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{\dot{q}} = 0
$$

By $\pdv{F}{q}$ and $\pdv{F}{\dot{q}}$ we simply mean "the \x[partial-derivative] of $F$ with respect to its second and third arguments". The notation is a bit confusing at first, but that's all it means.

Therefore, that expression ends up being at most a \x[order-of-a-differential-equation][second order] \x[ordinary-differential-equation] where $q$ is the unknown, since:
* the term $\pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{q}$ is a function of $t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)$
* the term $\pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{\dot{q}}$ is a function of $t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)$. And so it's derivative with respect to time will contain only up to $\ddot{q}$

Now let's think about the multi-dimensional case. Instead of having $q : \R \to \R$, we now have $q : \R \to \R^n$. Think about the \x[lagrangian-mechanics] motivation of a \x[double-pendulum] where for a given time we have two angles.

Let's do the 2-dimensional case then. In that case, $F$ is going to be a function of 5 variables $F : \R^5 \to \R$ rather than 3 as in the one dimensional case, and the functional looks like:
$$I(q) = \int_{t_0}^{t} F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2})(t) dt$$

This time, the Euler-Lagrange equations are going to be a system of two \x[ordinary-differential-equation]{p} on two unknown functions $q_1$ and $q_2$ of order up to 2 in both variables:
$$
\pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t))}{q_1} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t)}{\dot{q_1}} = 0 \\
\pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t))}{q_2} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t)}{\dot{q_2}} = 0 \\
$$
At this point, notation is getting a bit clunky, so people will often condense the $q_i$ vector
$$
\pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{q_1} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{\dot{q_1}} = 0 \\
\pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{q_2} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{\dot{q_2}} = 0 \\
$$
or just omit the arguments of $F$ entirely:
$$
\pdv{F}{q_i} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F}{\dot{q_i}} = 0
$$

Basically: \x[why-do-symmetries-such-as-su-3-su-2-and-u-1-matter-in-particle-physics].

= Lagrangian density
{parent=lagrangian-field-theory}

When we particles particles, the \x[action-physics] is obtained by integrating the \x[lagrangian] over time:
$$
Action = \int_{t_0}^{t} L(x(t), \pdv{x(t)}{t}, t) dt
$$

In the case of \x[field-mathematics]{p} however, we can expand the Lagrangian out further, to also integrate over the space coordinates and their derivatives.

Since we are now working with something that gets integrated over space to obtain the total action, much like \x[density] would be integrated over space to obtain a total mass, the name "Lagrangian density" is fitting.

E.g. for a 2-dimensional field $f(x, y, t)$:
$$
Action = \int_{t_0}^{t} L(f(x, y, t), \pdv{f(x, y, t)}{x}, \pdv{f(x, y, t)}{y}, \pdv{f(x, y, t)}{t}, x, y, t) dx dy dt
$$

Of course, if we were to write it like that all the time we would go mad, so we can just write a much more condensed \x[vectorized] version using the \x[gradient] with $x \in \R^2$:
$$
Action = \int_{t_0}^{t} L(f(x, t), \grad{f(x, t)}, x, t) dx dt
$$

And in the context of \x[special-relativity], people condense that even further by adding $t$ to the spacetime \x[four-vector] as well, so you don't even need to write that separate pesky $t$.

The main point of talking about the Lagrangian density instead of a Lagrangian for fields is likely that it treats space and time in a more uniform way, which is a basic requirement of \x[special-relativity]: we have to be able to mix them up somehow to do \x[lorentz-transformation]{p}. Notably, this is a key ingredient in a/the formulation of \x[quantum-field-theory].

The variables of the \x[lagrangian], e.g. the angles of a \x[double-pendulum]. From that example it is clear that these variables don't need to be simple things like \x[cartesian-coordinate]{p} or \x[polar-coordinate]{p} (although these tend to be the overwhelming majority of simple case encountered): any way to describe the system is perfectly valid.

In \x[quantum-field-theory], those variables are actually fields.

= Noether's theorem
{c}
{parent=lagrangian-mechanics}

For every \x[continuous-symmetry] in the system (\x[lie-group]), there is a corresponding conservation law.

Furthermore, given the symmetry, we can calculate the derived conservation law, and vice versa.

As mentioned at http://buzzard.ups.edu/courses/2017spring/projects/schumann-lie-group-ups-434-2017.pdf[], what the symmetry (\x[lie-group]) acts on (obviously?!) are the \x[lagrangian] \x[generalized-coordinate]{p}. And from that, we immediately guess that manifolds are going to be important, because the generalized variables of the Lagrangian can trivially be \x[non-euclidean-geometry], e.g. the \x[pendulum] lives on an infinite cylinder.

The key difference from \x[lagrangian-mechanics] is that the Hamiltonian approach groups variables into pairs of coordinates called the \x[phase-space-coordinate]{p}:
* generalized coordinates, generally positions or angles
* their corresponding conjugate momenta, generally velocities, or angular velocities
This leads to having two times more unknown functions than in the Lagrangian. However, it also leads to a \x[system-of-partial-differential-equations] with only first order derivatives, which is nicer. Notably, it can be more clearly seen in \x[phase-space].

Ah, the jewel of \x[computational-physics].

Also known as an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods[ab initio] method: no experimental measurement is taken as input, \x[quantum-electrodynamics][QED is all you need].

But since QED is thought to fully describe all relevant aspects \x[molecule]{p}, it could be called "the" ab initio method.

For one, if we were able to predict protein molecule interactions, our understanding of \x[molecular-biology-technologies] would be solved.

This is where \x[isidor-rabi] exposed experiments carried out on the \x[anomalous-magnetic-dipole-moment] and \x[willis-lamb] presented his work on the \x[lamb-shift].

It was a very private and intimate conference, that gathered the best physicists of the area, one is reminded of the style of the \x[solvay-conference].

\x[qed-and-the-men-who-made-it-dyson-feynman-schwinger-and-tomonaga-by-silvan-schweber-1994] chapter 4.1 this conference was soon compared to the \x[first-solvay-conference-1911], which set in motion the development of \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics].

Followup to the \x[shelter-island-conference], this is where \x[julian-schwinger] and \x[richard-feynman] exposed their theories to explain the experiments of the previous conference.

Julian made a formal presentation that took until the afternoon and bored everyone to death, though the mathematics avoided much questioning.

Feynman then presented his revolutionary approach, which he was unable to prove basic properties of, but which gave correct results, and people were not very happy.

{wiki=David_Tong_(physicist)}

A charismatic, perfect-\x[english-language]-accent (\x[received-pronunciation]) \x[physicist] from \x[university-of-cambridge], specializing in \x[quantum-field-theory].

He has done several "\x[vulgarization]" lectures, some of which could be better called undergrad appetizers rather, a notable example being \x[video-quantum-fields-the-real-building-blocks-of-the-universe-by-david-tong-2017] for the prestigious \x[royal-institution], but remains a hardcore researcher: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=felFiY4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate[]. Lots of \x[open-access] publications BTW, so \x[kudos].

The amount of lecture notes on his website looks really impressive: http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html[], he looks like a good educator.

David has also shown some interest in applications of high energy mathematical ideas to \x[condensed-matter], e.g. links between the \x[renormalization-group] and \x[phase-transition] phenomena. TODO there was a YouTube video about that, find it and link here.

\x[ciro-santilli] \x[physics-gossip][wonders] if his family is of \x[east-asian], origin and if he can still speak any east asian languages. "Tong" is of course a transcription of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_(surname)[several major Chinese surnames] and from looks he could be mixed blood, but as mentioned at https://www.ancestry.co.uk/name-origin?surname=tong it can also be an English "metonymic occupational name for a maker or user of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongs[tongs]". After staring at his picture for a while Ciro is going with the maker of tongs theory initially.

\x[ciro-santilli]'s admiration for Dyson goes beyond his "unify all the things approach", which \x[high-flying-bird-vs-gophers][Ciro loves], but also extends to the way he talks and the things he says. Dyson is one of Ciro's favorite physicist.

Besides this, he was also very \x[idealistic] compassionate, and supported a peaceful resolution until \x[world-war-ii] with \x[united-kingdom] was basically ineviatble. Note that this was a strategic mistake.

Dyson is "hawk nosed" as mentioned in \x[genius-richard-feynman-and-modern-physics-by-james-gleick-1994] chapter "Dyson". But he wasn't when he was young, see e.g. https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/freemandyson_child-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1064&ssl=1 It sems that his nose just never stopped growing after puberty.

He also has some fun stories, like him practicing \x[night-climbing] while at \x[cambridge-university], and having walked from \x[cambridge] to \x[london] (~86km!) in a day with his wheelchair bound friend.

\x[ciro-santilli] feels that the label \x[child-prodigy] applies even more so to him than to \x[feynman] and \x[julian-schwinger].

Head of the theoretical division at the \x[los-alamos-laboratory] during the \x[manhattan-project].

\x[richard-feynman] was working under him there, and was promoted to team lead by him because Richard impressed Hans.

He was also the person under which \x[freeman-dyson] was originally under when he moved from the \x[united-kingdom] to the \x[united-states].

And Hans also impressed Feynman, both were problem solvers, and liked solving mental arithmetic and \x[numerical-analysis].

This relationship is what brought Feynman to \x[cornell-university] after \x[world-war-ii], Hans' institution, which is where Feynman did the main part of his \x[1965-nobel-prize-in-physics-laureate][Nobel prize winning] work on \x[quantum-electrodynamics].

Extremely precocious, borderline \x[child-prodigy], he was reading \x[dirac] at 13-14 from the library.

He started working at night and sleeping during the moring/early afternoon while he was at university.

He was the type of guy that was so good that he didn't really have to follow the university rules very much. He would get into trouble for not following some stupid requirement, but he was so good that they would just let him get away with it.

Besides \x[quantum-electrodynamics], Julian worked on \x[radar] at the \x[rad-lab] during \x[world-war-ii], unlike most other top \x[physicist]{p} who went to \x[los-alamos-laboratory] to work on the \x[atomic-bomb], and he made important contributions there on calculating the best shape of the parts and so on.

He was known for being very formal mathematically and sometimes hard to understand, in stark contrast to \x[feynman] which was much more lose and understandable, especially after \x[freeman-dyson] translated him to the masses.

However, \x[qed-and-the-men-who-made-it-dyson-feynman-schwinger-and-tomonaga-by-silvan-schweber-1994] does emphacise that he was actually also very practical in the sense that he always aimed to obtain definite numbers out of his calculations, and that was not only the case for the \x[lamb-shift].

Maybe this obsession is partly due to his name which no \x[english-language] speaking person knows how to pronounce from the writing.

Dirac was a staunch \x[atheist] having said during the \x[fifth-solvay-conference-1927]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvay_Conference{ref}:
\Q[If we are honest - and scientists have to be - we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards - in heaven if not on earth - all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.]

While learning black-hole stuff is not on top of \x[ciro-santilli]'s priorities, Hawking's spirit is to be admired.

To never give up even when everything seems lost, and still have a sense of humour is respectable.

An ex-physicist colleague who had met Hawking told an anecdote. Hawking was around in the department one day, they said hi and all. But then Hawking wanted to tell a joke. It took like 5 minutes of typing, and you can imagine that things were pretty awkward and the joke's timing was "a bit off". But Hawking did tell the joke nonetheless.

{tag=essays-by-ciro-santilli}

The natural sciences are not just a tool to predict the future.

They are a reminder that the lives that we live daily are mere illusions, just like \x[buddhist]{p} and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)[Hinduists] say.

We as individuals perceive nothing about the materials that we touch every day really work, nor more importantly how our \x[brain] and \x[cell-biology]{p} work.

Everything is magic out of our control.

The natural sciences allow us peek, with huge concentrated effort, into tiny little bits a little of those unknowns, and blow our minds as we notice that we don't know anything.

For all practical purposes in life, there is a huge macro micro gap. We are only able to directly perceive and influence the macro events. And through those we try to affect micro events. Because for good or bad, micro events reflect in the macro world.

Every one or two weeks \x[ciro-santilli] remembers that he and everything he touches are just a bunch of atoms, and that is an amazing feeling.

\x[alan-watts]'s \x[video-alan-watts-philosopher-talk]["Philosopher" talk] mentions related ideas:
\Q[The origin of a person who is defined as a philosopher, is one who finds that existence itself is exceedingly odd.]

The toddler of a friend of \x[ciro-santilli-s-wife] asked her mum:
\Q[Why doesn't my tiger doll close its eyes when we sleep?]
Our perception of the macroscopic world is so magic that children have to learn the difference between living and non-living things.

= Atom
{parent=chemistry}
{wiki}

= Atomic theory
{synonym}

Theory that atoms exist, i.e. matter is not continuous.

Much before atoms were thought to be "experimentally real", chemists from the 19th century already used "conceptual atoms" as units for the proportions observed in macroscopic chemical reactions, e.g. $2 H_2 + O_2 \leftrightarrow H_{2}O$. The thing is, there was still the possibility that those proportions were made up of something continuous that for some reason could only combine in the given proportions, so the atoms could only be strictly consider calculatory devices pending further evidence.

\x[subtle-is-the-lord-by-abraham-pais-1982] chapter 5 "The reality of molecules" has some good mentions. Notably, physicists generally came to believe in atoms earlier than chemists, because the phenomena they were most interested in, e.g. pressure in the \x[ideal-gas-law], and then \x[maxwell-boltzmann-statistics] just scream atoms more loudly than chemical reactions, as they saw that these phenomena could be explained to some degree by traditional mechanics of little balls.

Confusion around the probabilistic nature of the \x[second-law-of-thermodynamics] was also used as a physical counterargument by some. Pais mentions that \x[wilhelm-ostwald] notably argued that the \x[time-reversibility-of-classical-mechanics] + the second law being a fundamental law of physics (and not just probabilistic, which is the correct hypothesis as we now understand) must imply that atoms are not classic billiard balls, otherwise the second law could be broken.

Pais also mentions that a big "chemical" breakthrough was \x[isomers-suggest-that-atoms-exist].

Very direct evidence evidence:
* \x[brownian-motion] mathematical analysis in 1908. Brownian motion just makes it too clear that liquids cannot be continuous... if they were, there would obviously be no \x[brownian-motion], full stop.
* \x[x-ray-crystallography]: it \i[sees] crystal latices
* \x[scanning-tunnelling-microscope]: it \i[sees] individual atoms for Christ's sake, what else do you want?

Less direct evidence:
* 1874 \x[isomers-suggest-that-atoms-exist]
* \x[kinetic-theory-of-gases] seems to explain certain phenomena really well

\x[subtle-is-the-lord-by-abraham-pais-1982] page 40 mentions several methods that \x[einstein] used to "prove" that atoms were real. Perhaps the greatest argument of all is that several unrelated methods give the same estimates of atom size/mass:
* from 1905:
  * in light quantum paper
  * enabled by experimental work of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Pfeffer[Wilhelm Pfeffer] on producing rigid membranes
    * sugar molecules in water

\x[subtle-is-the-lord-by-abraham-pais-1982] page 85:
\Q[However, it became increasingly difficult in chemical circles to deny the reality of molecules after 1874, the year in which Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel independently explained the \x[isomerism] of certain organic substances in terms of \x[stereochemical] properties of carbon compounds.]
so it is quite cool to see that \x[organic-chemistry] is one of the things that pushed atomic theory forward. Because when you start to observe that \x[isomer]{p} has different characteristics, despite identical proportions of atoms, this is really hard to explain without talking about the relative positions of the atoms within molecules!

{parent=atomic-theory-evidence}
{title2=1785 or 1827}
{wiki}

Small microscopic visible particles move randomly around in water.

If water were continuous, this shouldn't happen. Therefore this serves as one important evidence of \x[atomic-theory].

The amount it moves also quantitatively matches with the expected properties of water and the floating particles, was was settled in 1905 by \x[einstein] at: \x[investigations-on-the-theory-of-the-brownian-movement-by-einstein-1905].

This suggestion that Brownian motion comes from the movement of atoms had been made much before Einstein however, and passed tortuous discussions. \x[subtle-is-the-lord-by-abraham-pais-1982] page 93 explains it well. There had already been infinite discussion on possible causes of those movements besides \x[atomic-theory], and many ideas were rejected as incompatible with observations:
\Q[Further investigations eliminated such causes as temperature gradients, mechanical disturbances, capillary actions, irradiation of the liquid (as long as the resulting temperature increase can be neglected), and the presence of convection currents within the liquid.]
The first suggestions of atomic theory were from the 1860s.

Tiny uniform plastic beads called "microbeads" are the preferred 2019 modern method of doing this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbead

Original well known observation in 1827 by Brown, with further experiments and interpretation in 1908 by \x[jean-baptiste-perrin]. Possible precursor observation in 1785 by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Ingenhousz[Jan Ingenhousz], not sure why he wasn't credited better.

Highly \x[radioactive] \x[isotope] of \x[caesium]  with \x[half-life] of 30.17 \x[year][y]. Produced from the \x[nuclear-fission] of \x[uranium], TODO exact reaction, not found in nature.

The \x[fucked] thing about this byproduct is that it is in the same chemical family as \x[sodium], and therefore forms a salt that looks like regular \x[sodium-chloride][table salt], and dissolves in water and therefore easily enters your body and sticks to things.

Another problem is that its \x[half-life] is long enough that it doesn't lose radioactivity very quickly compared to the life of a human person, although it is short enough to make it highly toxic, making it a terrible pollutant when released.

This is why for example in the \x[goiania-accident] a girl ended up ingesting Caesium-137 after eating an egg after touching the Caesium with her hands.

= DNA detection
{c}
{parent=dna}

DNA detection means determining if a specific DNA sequence is present in a sample.

This can be used to detect if a given species of microorganism is present in a sample, and is therefore a widely used diagnostics technique to see if someone is infected with a virus.

You could of course do full \x[dna-sequencing][DNA Sequencing] to see everything that is there, but since it is as a more generic procedure, sequencing is more expensive and slow.

The alternative is to use a \x[dna-amplification] technique.

= DNA amplification
{c}
{parent=dna}
{wiki}

DNA amplification is one of the key DNA technologies:
* it is one of the main ways in which \x[dna-detection] can be done.
* it is the first step of \x[illumina][Illumina sequencing], since you need multiple copies of several parts of the genome for the method to work

= Polymerase chain reaction
{parent=dna-amplification}
{title2=PCR}
{wiki}

This is an extremely widely used technique as of 2020 and much earlier.

If allows you to amplify "any" sequence of choice (TODO length limitations) between a start and end sequences of interest which you synthesize.

If the sequence of interest is present, it gets amplified exponentially, and you end up with a bunch of DNA at the end.

You can then measure the DNA concentration based on simple light refraction methods to see if there is a lot of DNA or not in the post-processed sample.

Even \x[ciro-santilli] had some contact with it at: \x[oxford-nanopore-river-bacteria]{full}, see: \x[oxford-nanopore-river-bacteria/pcr]{child}!

One common problem that happens with PCR if you don't design your primers right is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_dimer

= Real-time polymerase chain reaction
{parent=polymerase-chain-reaction}
{wiki}

Also known as: Quantitative PCR (qPCR).

Like PCR, but the amplification machine measures the concentration of DNA at each step.

This describes one possible concentration detection method with \x[fluorescence][fluorescent] molecules that only become fluorescent when the DNA is double stranded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYBR_Green_I[SYBR Green])

\Video[http://youtube.com/watch?v=YhXj5Yy4ksQ]
{title=Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) - Quantitative PCR (qPCR) by Applied Biological Materials (2016)}

This allows you to predict the exact initial concentration by extrapolating the exponential curve backwards.

TODO: vs non-real-time PCR. Why can't you just divide by 2 for every heating step to reach back the original concentration? Likely the reaction reach saturation at an unknown step.

TODO: vs non-real-time PCR in medical diagnostics: do you really need to know concentration for diagnostics? Isn't it enough to know if the virus is present or not?

= Isothermal DNA amplification techniques
{parent=polymerase-chain-reaction}

Isothermal means "at fixed temperature".

This is to contrast with the more well established \x[polymerase-chain-reaction], which requires heating and cooling the sample several times.

The obvious advantage of isothermal methods is that their machinery can be simpler and cheaper, and the process can happen faster, since you don't have to do through heating and cooling cycles.

= Loop-mediated isothermal amplification
{parent=isothermal-dna-amplification-techniques}
{title2=LAMP}
{wiki}

Like PCR, but does not require thermal cycling. Thus the "isothermal" in the name: iso means same, so "same temperature".

Not needing the thermo cycling means that the equipment needed is much smaller and cheaper it seems.

{parent=dna-sequencing}
{wiki}

Experiments that involve sequencing bulk DNA found in a sample to determine what species are present, as opposed to sequencing just a single specific specimen. Examples of samples that are often used:
* river water to determine which bacteria are present, notably to determine if the water is free of dangerous bacteria. A concrete example is shown at: \x[oxford-nanopore-river-bacteria]{child}{full}.
* sea water biodiversity: http://ocean-microbiome.embl.de/companion.html

The by far dominating DNA sequencing company of the late 2000's and 2010's due to having the smallest cost per base pair.

Illumina actually bought their 2010's dominating technology from a \x[cambridge] company called \x[solexa].

To understand how Illumina's technology works basically, watch this video: \x[video-illumina-sequencing-by-synthesis].

{id=video-illumina-sequencing-by-synthesis}

The key innovation of this method is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_dye_sequencing#Bridge_amplification[bridge amplification step], which produces a large amount of identical DNA strands: \x[image-bridge-amplification].

{id=image-bridge-amplification}
{title=Illustration of the bridge amplification step of Illumina's DNA sequencing.}

This step is genius because sequencing is basically a noise to signal problem, as you are trying to observe individual tiny nucleotides mixed with billions of other tiny nucleotides.

With bridge amplification, we group some of the nucleotides together, and multiply the signal millions of times for that part of the DNA.

This is one of the prime examples of \x[europe]'s decline.

Instead of trying to dominate the sequencing market and gain trillions of dollars from it, they local British early stage investors were more than happy to get a 20x return on their small initial investments, and sold out to the Americans who will then make the real profit.

And now Solexa doesn't even have its own \x[wikipedia] page, while Illumina is set out to be the next \x[microsoft]. What a disgrace.

Here are some good articles about the company:

Cambridge visitors can still visit the https://pantonarms.co.uk/[Panton Arms pub], which was the location of the legendary "hey we should talk" founders meeting, chosen due to its proximity to the chemistry department of the \x[university-of-cambridge].

In 2021 the founders were awarded the \x[breakthrough-prize]. The third person awarded was Pascal Mayer. He was apparently at Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute at the time of development. They do have a wiki page unlike Solexa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serono[]. They paid a 700 million fine in 2005 in the \x[united-states], and sold out in 2006 to \x[merck] for 10 billion USD.

= De novo DNA synthesis
{parent=dna}
{wiki=De_novo_synthesis}

As of 2018, \x[ciro-santilli] believes that this could be \x[the-next-big-thing] in \x[biology] technology.

"De novo" means "starting from scratch", that is: you type the desired sequence into a computer, and the synthesize it.

The "de novo" part is important, because it distinguishes this from the already well solved problem of duplicating DNA from an existing DNA template, which is what all our cells do daily, and which can already be done very efficiently \x[in-vitro] with \x[polymerase-chain-reaction].

Many \x[startup] companies are attempting to create more efficient de novo synthesis methods:
* https://twistbioscience.com/
* https://www.evonetix.com/technology/
* http://dnascript.co/
* https://www.ansabio.com/
* https://www.nuclera.com/

Notably, the dream of most of those companies is to have a machine that sits on a lab bench, which synthesises whatever you want.

TODO current de novo synthesis costs/time to delivery after ordering a custom sequence.

The initial main applications are likely going to be:
* \x[polymerase-chain-reaction] primers (determine which region will be amplified
* creating a custom sequence to be inserted in a \x[plasmid], i.e. \x[artificial-gene-synthesis]
but the real pipe dream is building and bootstraping entire \x[artificial-chromosome]{p}

News coverage:
* 2020-10-05 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0695-9 "Enzymatic DNA synthesis enters new phase"

\Video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNK0SZmEsks]
{title=Nuclera eDNA enzymatic \x[de-novo-dna-synthesis] explanatory animation (2021)}
{description=The video shows nicely how Nuclera's enzymatic DNA synthesis works:
* they provide blocked \x[nucleotide]{p} of a single type
* add them with the enzyme. They use a werid \x[dna-polymerase] called \x[terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase] that adds a base at a time to a single stranded DNA strand rather than copying from a template
* wash everything
* do deblocking reaction
* and then repeat until done

= Artificial gene synthesis
{parent=de-novo-dna-synthesis}
{wiki}

Using \x[de-novo-dna-synthesis] to synthesize a \x[gene]{p} to later insert somewhere.

Note that this is a specific application of \x[de-novo-dna-synthesis], e.g. \x[polymerase-chain-reaction] primers is another major application that does not imply creating genes.

= Artificial chromosome
{parent=artificial-gene-synthesis}

Using \x[de-novo-dna-synthesis] to synthesize entire \x[chromosome]{p}.

= Species bootstrapping from DNA
{parent=de-novo-dna-synthesis}

Synthesizing the DNA itself is not the only problem however.

You then have to get that DNA into a working living form state so that normal cell processes can continue:
* for \x[virus]{p} see: \x[synthetic-virus]
* for bacteria, you have to inject it into a cell
* for placental animals, you also have to somehow simulate a compatible placenta. It is likely easier for eggs.

TODO: if we had cheap \x[de-novo-dna-synthesis], how hard would it be to bootstrap a virus culture from that? https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/issues/60

Is it easy to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection[transfect] a cell with the synthesized DNA, and get it to generate full infectious viral particles?

If so, then \x[de-novo-dna-synthesis] would be very similar to 3D printed guns: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printed_firearms[].

= Operon vs transcription unit
{parent=operon}
{wiki}

Consider the \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-operon-thrlabc].

That single \x[operon] can produce two different \x[mrna] \x[transcription-unit]{p}:
* thrL only, the transcription unit is also called thrL: https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?object=TU0-42486
* thrL + thrA + thrB + thrC all together, the transcription unit is called thrLABC: https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?type=OPERON&object=TU00178

The reason for this appears to be that there is a \x[rho-independent-termination] region after thrL. But then under certain conditions, that must get innactivated, and then the thrLABC is produced instead.

It is interesting to note how one talks about \x[single-cell-analysis], in contrast to \x[whole-cell-simulation]: experimentally it is hard to analyse a single cell. But theoretically, it is hard to simulate a single cell. This mismatch is perhaps the ultimate frontier of \x[molecular-biology].

Each of the omics studies a subset of \x[molecular-biology] with a data intensive and broad point of view that tries to understand global function or organisms, trying to understand what every biologically relevant \x[molecule] does as part of the hole \x[metabolism].

The main omics are:
* \x[proteomics]{child}
* \x[metabolomics]{child}

\x[omics]{c} might be \x[stamp-collecting], but maybe it is a bit more like \x[trading-card-game]/\x[magic-the-gathering] collecting, in which the cards that you are collecting actually have specific uses and interactions, especially considering that most \x[metabolic-pathway]{p} are analogous across many \x[species].

\x[ciro-santilli] is extremely passionate about this issue, partly due to \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-compassionate-personality].

\x[ciro-santilli]'s main approaches to reduce it:
* \x[ourbigbook-com] to make education more efficient
* \x[free-gifted-education]
* more granular \x[electronic-voting]

One of Ciro's most direct experiences with social inequality is described at: \x[sao-remo-the-favela-next-to-usp].

We have to be careful not to make everyone poorer when trying to reduce inequality.

But as things stand as of 2020, \x[tax-the-rich][increasing taxes on the very richest], and notably \x[wealth-tax], and investing it in \x[free-gifted-education], seems like a safe bet to achieve any meaningful level of \x[equal-opportunity] and \x[meritocracy].

{wiki}

COVID happens in two stages:
* viral infection
* \x[inflammatory] phase, where the body takes over, and sometimes harms itself. It seems that people are not generally contagious at this point?

This distinction is one of the reasons why separating the virus name (SARS-CoV-2) from the disease makes sense: the disease is much broader than the viral infection.

= Why it takes several days to enter inflammatory phase in COVID-19?
{parent=covid-19}
{wiki}

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7247969/

Why is it there such a clear separation of phases?

Why do people with mild symptoms go on to die? It is a great mystery.

\x[ciro-santilli]'s theory is that COVID is extremely effective at avoiding \x[immune-response]. Then, in people where this is effective, things reach a point where there is so much virus, that the body notices and moves on to take a more drastic approach. This is compatible with the virus killing older people more, as they have weaker immunes systems. This is however incompatible with the fact that people don't seem to be contagious after the viral phase is over...

\Q[This site is the origin of replication of the E. coli chromosome. It contains the binding sites for DnaA, which is critical for initiation of replication. Replication proceeds bidirectionally. For historical reasons, the numbering of E. coli's \x[circular-chromosome] does not start at the \x[origin-of-replication], but at the origin of transfer during conjugation.]
If it is a bit hard to understand what they mean by "origin of transfer" though, as that term is usually associated with the \x[origin-of-transfer] of \x[bacterial-conjugation].

Part of \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-operon-thrlabc].

At only 65 bp, this gene is quite small and boring. For a more interesting gene, have a look at the next gene, \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-gene-thra].

Does something to do with \x[threonine].

This is the first in the sequence thrL, thrA, thrB, thrC. This type of naming convention is quite common on related adjacent proteins, all of which must be getting \x[transcribed-biology] into a single \x[rna] by the same \x[promoter-genetics]. As mentioned in the analysis of the \x[kegg] entry for \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-gene-thra], those A, B and C are actually directly functionally linked in a direct \x[metabolic-pathway].

We can see that thrL, A, B, and C are in the same \x[transcription-unit] by browsing the list of \x[promoter-genetics]{p} at: https://biocyc.org/group?id=:ALL-PROMOTERS&orgid=ECOLI[]. By finding the first one by position we reach; https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?object=TU0-42486[].

The second \x[gene] in the \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655] genome. Part of the \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-operon-thrlabc].

Part of a reaction that produces \x[threonine].

This \x[protein] is an \x[enzyme]{parent}. The \x[uniprot] entry clearly shows the \x[chemical-reaction]{p} that it \x[catalyses]. In this case, there are actually two! It can either transforming the \x[metabolite]:
* "L-homoserine" into "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde"
* "L-aspartate" into "4-phospho-L-aspartate"
Also interestingly, we see that both of those reaction require some extra energy to catalyse, one needing \x[adenosine-triphosphate] and the other \x[nadp-plus].

TODO: any mention of how much faster it makes the reaction, numerically?

Since this is an \x[enzyme], it would also be interesting to have a quick search for it in the \x[kegg] entry starting from the organism: https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco01100+M00022 We type in the search bar "thrA", it gives a long list, but the last entry is our "thrA". Selecting it highlights two pathways in the large \x[graph], so we understand that it catalyzes two different reactions, as suggested by the protein name itself (fused blah blah). We can now hover over:
* the \x[edge-graph]: it shows all the enzymes that catalyze the given reaction. Both edges actually have multiple enzymes, e.g. the L-Homoserine path is also catalyzed by another enzyme called metL.
* the \x[node-graph]: they are the \x[metabolite]{p}, e.g. one of the paths contains "L-homoserine" on one node and "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde"
Note that common \x[cofactor-biochemistry]{p} are omitted, since we've learnt from the UniProt entry that this reaction uses ATP.

If we can now click on the L-Homoserine edge, it takes us to: https://www.genome.jp/entry/eco:b0002+eco:b3940[]. Under "Pathway" we see an interesting looking pathway "Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism": https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260+b0002 which contains a small manually selected and extremely clearly named subset of the larger graph!

But looking at the bottom of this subgraph (the UI is not great, can't Ctrl+F and enzyme names not shown, but the selected enzyme is slightly highlighted in red because it is in the URL https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260+b0002[] vs https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260[]) we clearly see that thrA, thrB and thrC for a sequence that directly transforms "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde" into "Homoserine" to "O-Phospho-L-homoserine" and finally to\x[threonine]. This makes it crystal clear that they are not just located adjacently in the genome by chance: they are actually functionally related, and likely controlled by the same transcription factor: when you want one of them, you basically always want the three, because you must be are lacking \x[threonine]. TODO find transcription factor!

The UniProt entry also shows an interactive browser of the \x[tertiary-structure] of the protein. We note that there are currently two sources available: \x[x-ray-crystallography] and \x[alphafold]. To be honest, the \x[alphafold] one looks quite off!!!

By inspecting the \x[fasta] for the entire genome, or by using the \x[ncbi-open-reading-frame-tool], we see that this gene lies entirely in its own \x[open-reading-frame], so it is quite boring

From the \x[fasta] we see that the very first three \x[codon]{p} at position 337 are
```
ATG CGA GTG
```
where `ATG` is the \x[start-codon], and CGA GTG should be the first two that actually go into the protein:
* CGA: \x[arginine]
* GTG: \x[valine]

https://ecocyc.org/gene?orgid=ECOLI&id=ASPKINIHOMOSERDEHYDROGI-MONOMER[] mentions that the enzime is most active as \x[protein-complex] with four copies of the same protein:
\Q[Aspartate kinase I / homoserine dehydrogenase I comprises a \x[protein-dimer][dimer] of ThrA dimers. Although the dimeric form is catalytically active, the binding equilibrium dramatically favors the tetrameric form. The aspartate kinase and homoserine dehydrogenase activities of each ThrA monomer are catalyzed by independent domains connected by a linker region.]

The weirdest \x[mammal] \x[clade]: they lay fucking \x[egg]{p}. Only 5 known species alive as of 2020.

Eggs are \x[basal-phylogenetics]: they simply didn't evolve out of what other \x[reptile]{p} do. From which we conclude that \x[milk] came before \x[egg]{p} stopped.

So this is the most basal subclade of mammals.

Etymology: means "single hole" in \x[greek-language], because like other \x[reptile]{p} it has a single hole for \x[shit], \x[pee] and \x[fucking]: the \x[cloaca].

= Borlotti beans
{parent=plant}
{wiki=Cranberry_bean}

This looks a lot like the beans that \x[brazilian]{p} venerate and can be easily found in the \x[united-kingdom] as of 2020.

The more exact type seems to be \x[pinto-bean], but this is close enough.

2021-03: same but 2.5 teaspons, seems to be the right ammount.

2021-02-10: attempt 3: 500g 1 hour 30 minutes no pressure, uncontrolled water. Salt with one chorizo: put 3 teaspoons, it was a bit too much, going to do 2 next time and see.

2020-12-14: attempt 3: 250g of beans, 1.5l of water, 30 minutes pressure.

2020-11-30: attempt 2: 275ml of dry beans, about 50% of 500g bag, putting 1650 ml (6x) of water on pressure cooker Still had to throw out some water.

Density dry raw: 216 g/250 ml = 432 g / 500 ml = 500 g / 580 ml = 864 g/L

500 g dry expands to in water after 12 hours: 1200 ml

Therefore 500 g dry = 864 / 2 L = 432 ml expands about 3x.

Therefore, to the maximum 2.5L of the cooker with 8x https://www.oliviascuisine.com/brazilian-style-beans/[dry volume water from this recipe] I can use:
``
2500 = volume expanded bean + volume water = 3 volume dry bean + 8 volume dry bean = 11 volume dry bean
``
and so:
``
volume dry bean = 2500/11 = 227ml
``
which is about 227 / 580 = 40% of the 500 g bag.

After first try, I found that 8x volume of water is way, way too much. Going to try 6x next time.

= Pinto bean
{parent=plant}

This seems to be the "brown \x[brazilian] bean" that many Brazilians eat every day.

Edit: after buying it, not 100% sure. This one felt smaller than what Ciro had in Brazil, \x[borlotti-beans] might be closer. Pinto beans are smaller, and creamier, and have softer peel, possibly produced less \x[fart][natural gas].

2021-04: second try.

2021-03: did for first time, started with same procedure as \x[borlotti-beans] 2021-03. Maybe 1h30 is too much. Outcome was still very good.

Sequence alignment is trying to match a \x[dna] or \x[amino-acid] sequence, even though the sequences might not be exactly the same, otherwise it would be a straight up \x[string-search-algorithm].

This is fundamental in \x[bioinformatics] for two reasons:

* when doing \x[dna-sequencing], and specially \x[short-read-dna-sequencing], you generally need to align the reads to reference genomes to know where you are inside the entire genome, and then be able to spot \x[mutation]{p}, notably \x[single-nucleotide-polymorphism]{p}

\x[ciro-santilli] supports full legalization of all drugs, because he feels that it would be better overall for the world to have cheaper drugs and more \x[drug-addict]{p}, but way, way less \x[organized-crime].

These should be extremely controlled of course, with extremely high \x[tax]{p} that puts their price just below the current illegal market, and a complete ban on any positive \x[advertising].

Ciro believes that maybe the \x[government] could even go as far as giving free drugs to \x[drug-addict]{p} so they don't have to \x[theft][rob] to get a fix.

This is notably considering that drug-led organized crime completely dominates and corrupts the \x[politics] of many production and trafficking zones, which are already generally poor \x[fucked] up places to start with:
* \x[mexican-drug-war]
* \x[golden-crescent]
* \x[golden-triangle-southeast-asia]
Ciro's experiences in Brazil such as mentioned at \x[sao-remo-the-favela-next-to-usp], although much less extreme than the above, also come to mind.

Drug traffic corrupts everything. It prevents development of honest people. It is a \x[cancer], which we have failed time and time a gain to cure. The only cure is to accept the other less insidious of addiction.

\x[surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman] chapter An Offer You Must Refuse (a play on words on \x[the-godfather-1972]) has an interesting historical mention from the early 1950s while at \x[caltech]:
\Q[
The next day, I had the greatest luck in making a decision. God must have set it up to help me decide. I was walking to my office, and a guy came running up to me and said, "Hey, Feynman! Did you hear what happened? Baade found that there are two different populations of stars! All the measurements we had been making of the distances to the galaxies had been based on Cephid variables of one type, but there's another type, so the universe is twice, or three, or even four times as old as we thought!"

I knew the problem. In those days, the \x[age-of-earth][earth appeared to be older] than the universe. The earth was four and a half billion, and the universe was only a couple, or three billion years old. It was a great puzzle. And this discovery resolved all that: The universe was now demonstrably older than was previously thought. And I got this information right away - the guy came running up to me to tell me all this.

Countries of the world have only two choices as of 2019: either rally behind the US and support democracy, or rally behind China and support dictatorship. The choice is up to you, voters. The more you deal with China, the more you lose your democracy and freedom. All dictatorships have no doubt that they must stick together.

\x[ciro-santilli]'s birth country.

An awesome country, with amazing people and natural resources, and without an evil government like \x[china].

When visiting Brazilian cities coming from \x[europe], one of the things that shocks the most is the amount of motorcycles. It seems that the poorer the country, the less people's lives are worth, and the more motorcycles there are.

Another thing that was shocking is the amount of phone spam when you get a new SIM card, some \x[legal] and some likely illegal. Everyone is desperate for cash it seems on a poor country, and everyone fights hard for it.

{c}
{parent=sao-paulo-state}
{wiki=Santos,_São_Paulo}

\x[ciro-santilli] lived in Santos from about the year 1998 to 2007, there until he went to university.

Santos is the nearest beach city to \x[sao-paulo-city], and for this reason:
* the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_container_ports[largest port of Latin America in 2018], through which large chunks of the precious https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_production_in_Brazil[coffee export] exited \x[brazil] in the 19th century. There is a http://www.museudocafe.org.br/en/[Coffee museum in Santos].

  This importance is also linked to the fact that Santos is one of the oldest \x[european] cities in Brazil, being founded in 1546. From this you can infer that it was a good port. One reason for this is obvious if you look at the map of the city: the neighbouring towns of Praia Grande and Guarujá form a large protected bay where ships may safely dock.
* a popular local tourist destination that gets crowded on hot \x[weekend]{p}, with the beach line being fully built with tall buildings from the 60's, many of which became https://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/04/the-leaning-buildings-of-santos-brazil.html[incredibly bent due to the inadequate technology used on such soft soil]

Ciro idolizes Santos as the \x[ciro-santilli-s-ideal-city-to-live-in][perfect location to live] nature-wise due to its amazing wide sandy beach, in which Ciro spent endless hours walking on the sand and on the https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/9/best-brazilian-guinness-world-records-in-honor-of-independence-day-44636/[largest beachfront garden in the world] (https://web.archive.org/web/20180407071903/https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/9/best-brazilian-guinness-world-records-in-honor-of-independence-day-44636/[archive]), \x[the-correlation-between-software-engineers-and-buddhism][meditating], and \x[ciro-santilli-s-sport-practice][playing some soccer after school was over]. Santos is also the city where https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelé[Pelé] first played professionally.

Ciro has visited Santos several times after leaving \x[brazil]. Doing this gives him a weird feeling of having a separate life, in which time passes 2 weeks every few years. Of course, as your family grows, it gets harder and harder to go back home, and your family members might want to just go travel to more interesting places than just stay at your wonderful beach which you love in part due to nostalgia.

Ciro is also fond of the concept of the small public buildings near the beach garden (postos de praia), which serve different cultural activities: library, comic book store, art cinema, surf school. It is such a shame that the library and comic book ones are in such bad shape as of 2020, old books and poor people who go there to sleep a bit in the barely working air conditioning. Ciro fantasizes how those could instead be cultural hubs for the gathering of the brightest \x[art][artists], and scientists, of town. Maybe they are just too small. Maybe it is not within the realm of possibility of public service. Maybe, we should focus instead in the poorer regions, far form the beach. But the dream remains.

Santos only has one natural defect: mosquitoes. By the sea it is fine because the wind is strong, and they don't like salt water. But anywhere else, you will be eaten alive, and maybe get \x[dengue], Ciro got it once. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_drive[Gene drive], please.

{description=This is one of Santos 7 old canals, which are still in use and serve to reduce floodings in the city, which are caused by the strong tropical rains that fall on the city. This is particularly important to keep the mosquito population under some control. All canals were built in the first third of the 20th century, except canal 7 which is from 1968https://revistanove.com.br/nossa-historia/os-canais-de-santos/{ref}. The canals have normally very shallow water when it is not raining, and since it is rain water they are basically clean. There are other canals which are/were used for sewage, but then are not open air. The canals now serve as handy reference points and practical avenues in town, as well as being surrounded with nice trees that provide shade and drop small inedible purple fruit that will stain your car for all eternity. They do scar the beach line a bit it must be said, but it's part of the charm of the city, and they serve as good reference points for runners.}

Although \x[ciro-santilli] lived in São Paulo City nominally \x[ciro-santilli-s-formal-education][during his studies], it would be more precise to say that he lived in \x[university-of-sao-paulo][University of São Paulo]-land, because Ciro was cheap, didn't have a car, and did nothing but study, stay at home, go back to \x[santos-sao-paulo-brazil][Santos] to see his parents and the beach.

But the little he saw of the city made a deep impression on him.

The unreasonable size.

The unbearable contrasts.

\x[popular-brazilian-music][Caetano's Sampa] is the ultimate description of the city.

= Municipal Market of São Paulo
{c}
{parent=sao-paulo-city}
{wiki}

Once upon a time, this must have been a nice covered market.

But as of 2020, it is completely surrounded by extremely poor people, to the point that it makes you scared if you stand out in any way by showing any kind of middle/upper class wealth, or being a foreigner.

The market is basically a touristic spot that no person in Sao Paulo will ever go to (unless they are young, single, and can just walk in there by themselves) in the middle of this surreal environment.

In 2020 Ciro was there with \x[ciro-santilli-s-wife][his wife] on a touristic visit. Living in \x[europe] at the time, he felt even more privileged. So they went to a fruit stand, and the man started giving his wife amazing free samples of very exotic fruit, some of which Ciro had never tasted himself, without saying the price. It did feel like he was giving out too much for free. Then Ciro decided of course to buy some more fruits to pay for the show, which was a nice show. Then while buying, it came out a bit more expensive than would have been reasonable, but Ciro was too dazzled by the speed and noises, and he paid for it. Later on, he told his wife about it, and how he felt that they had added some ultra-expensive bulk fruits that were of a clearly lower level than the gold nuggets of the free samples (especially for Brazil's cost standards). The presenter was an extremely crafty con artist, and Ciro felt like they had specifically preyed on \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-compassionate-personality], because it was apparent that those men were underprivileged and fighting for their living day by day with those over-expensive fruits. This was an extremely valuable lesson, Ciro was glad that it was learnt at a relatively low cost on that occasion.

\x[ciro-santilli] lived in Paris for a few years between 2013 and 2016, and he can confirm the uncontroversial fact that "Paris is Magic".

Not just one type of magic though. Every quarter in Paris has its own unique personality that sets it apart and gives it a different mood.

Ciro knows Paris not from its historical facts, but from the raw feeling of endless walks through its streets in different times of the year. Ciro is a walker.

Paris, is a friendly city to walkers, as it is not too large, and does not have too many extremely busy roads, you can basically cross all of it on foot.

Maybe one day Ciro will expand this section to try and convey into words his feelings of love for the city, but maybe the effort would be pointless. Maybe such feelings can only be felt by other free-roaming walker souls living in the city, and that is both beautiful and a shame.

The United Kingdom is one big field.

Everything is extremely uniform and fully controlled by humans. Maybe this is partially due to it being an island with extensive flood plains. Loots of \x[magic-the-gathering][white mana] floating around there.

Some impressively sounding natural parks look more like cute countryside that is slightly hillier than the surrounding countryside.

This uniformity does however make it quite comfortable for its Hobbit inhabitants.

It also means that whenever slightly out of the ordinary happens, e.g., a bit of slightly heavier \x[rain], everything floods. In some way however, the Brits are very pragmatic, and as long as the flood is not too bad, they just let it be, it might be cheaper.

There are valid reasons to be pro-Brexit, given the uselessness of the \x[european-union].

The problem was how the campaign was conducted, in a purely nationalistic, populist and fake news manner, and largely supported by business leaders who immediately after still wanted to hire cheap foreign labour, use tax havens and move headquarters to other countries, e.g.:

{parent=british-custom}

The \x[british] are very pragmatic. This has good and bad effects.

For example, a good effect is that many things work pretty well, such as the \x[government]. This also helped \x[industry] develop.

A bad effect is that they sometimes settle on local minima forever. Examples:
* as of 2020, they are still using \x[imperial-unit]{p} in everyday life, rather than \x[international-system-of-units], which was setup by the \x[french], who are much more \x[idealistic], and can therefore can break from such insanity more often.
* the persistence of the insane system of \x[colleges-of-the-university-of-oxford]
* the incredibly late date of the \x[decimal-day] in 1971, and that was partly due to the advent of the \x[computer]. That one was too much, even for the Brits, or maybe it helped that the greedy financiers were involved
* the British train system as of the 2010's, which is completely not unified, each part operated by a different company with different standards. Private and public unification efforts are ongoing, Trainline being one of the best/only private buy from any line unification approaches.
* \x[church-of-england] priests can marry, which reduces the proportion of pedophiles. Also women were accepted starting in the 1970's in certain dioceses (non uniform rules as usual, typical of English pragmatism), including for bishop

British weather is not as bad as the stereotype, at least not in the southern half of the country.

Notably, it does not \x[rain] that much, and when it rains, it is a very light \x[rain], which \x[brazilian]{p} from \x[sao-paulo-state] or , at most, a "drizzle".

It feels like the weather forecasts are almost always worse than reality, maybe it is a way to not make people disappointed.

What there is relatively a lot of is wind, and fog. But the wind is generally warm and wet, it is very maritime.

= Cycling in the United Kingdom
{parent=united-kingdom}

The \x[united-kingdom] is a great place to cycle in general as there's plenty of small country roads and interesting new small towns to discover, perhaps much like the rest of \x[europe], as opposed to the \x[united-states], which likely has some huge infinitely long straight roads with a lot of nothing in between.

Of particular interest is the large amount of airfields and small air raid shelters in the fields, an ominous reminder of world war 2. The airfields are in various states, from functional military fields, many converted to civilian usage, some have barely any tarmac left but still see usage. And some were just completely abandoned and decayed and became recreation grounds and farms. The UK is therefore also a great place to be if you want to learn to fly as a hobby!

https://www.sustrans.org.uk/national-cycle-network/

Great set of long distance routes.

They are very well chosen for their high safety and level interest, so you can just go into them without putting much thought into it.

Sometimes they go a bit too much on the side of safety, making certain transitions annoying, but in general the selection is spot on.

The routes do sometimes go on a bit of gravel, so they are most adequate for hybrid bikes rather than road bikes, although road bikes would be able to to much of them. A more road-bike dedicated possibility is the \x[the-national-byway].

Note however that there are many many other local routes which are not in the network, but arguably equally, or more worthwhile.

Their diginal map distribution mechanisms are a bit \x[shitty] and sometimes asks you to pay for certain formats, which is hard to understand given that the maintainer of those maps, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordnance_Survey[Ordnance Survey] appears to be public... https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/issues/61 "How to see the Sustrans National Cycle Network on Google maps?"

Googling "National Cycle Netowrk \x[keyhole-markup-language][KML]" leads to: https://data-sustrans-uk.opendata.arcgis.com/ from which we can download the KML. https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/216770/how-to-open-kml-file-in-google-maps-for-android then shows how to make that viewable on \x[google-maps] by going through https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/?hl=en on the browser. TODO 2021-11:
* KML: nothing happens after the upload finishes, the "Select button remains grayed out
* CSV: you need to "Choose a column to title your markers", but all I tried give "Oops! We're having trouble finding those locations. Did you pick the correct location columns?"
"Ralph Hughes" https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralph-hughes-501474121 is listed as the creator/responsible of the exports, but can't find his email.

GPSPrune 20.2-1 can open the KML however, so that file can't be entirely wrong.

\x[openstreetmaps] has them on by default though if you just click "Cycle Map" layer. It is not as incredibly detalied as the Ordnance Survey one, e.g. does not show which side of the street to ride on, but still, is very good.

Contains the \x[university-of-cambridge], that's about it really, from that everything follows.

The city appear to exist there because it was a convenient crossing of the Cam. It also lies near the start of the ancient navigable section TODO towards north or south? Castle hill also offered a convenient fortification location near the river, and is part of the reason for the early Roman settlement. The original bridge was presumably in the current Magnalene bridge, just under the castle hill.

Anywhere north, including NE and NW: fenlands, i.e. marshes. Quite a few quarries as well. Extremely flat, very uniform, towns often have to be on top of small hills to escape the incessant flooding. Norfolk Coast AONB is beautiful if you take a train ride first, the beaches are very wide and many of them have few people if you avoid a few very busy spots.

East and SE: rolling hills towards Suffolk and the coast. Beautiful county, both Dedham Vale AONB and Suffolk Coast AONB.

South: first one of the hilliest nearby areas around Elmdon and Arkesden, then gently going down to the lush Lee River valley.

Southwest: larger and larger cities as you move towards London. From a train starting point, you can reach the Northen Chilterns, for some serious hills.

West: mostly flat farmland until you hit the River Great Ousse.

The city clearly exists because it is in the confluence of the river Thames and the River Cherwell. In such confluences, terrain tends to be flat, and fords are also common, with crossings wide and shallow, and so it was an important crossing place.

Notably, the Cherwell is a natural link between London and the North towards \x[coventry], and then Birmingham, as it, and then the Thames in which it goes into, puncture through both the Chilterns, then North Essex Downs and the Cotswolds hills. The M40.

While \x[ciro-santilli] is a big fan of having "one global country" (\x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world][and language]), which is somewhat approximated by globalization, he has come to believe that there is one serious downside to globalization as it stands in 2020: it allows companies to pressure \x[government]{p} to reduce \x[tax]{p}, and thus \x[governments-have-lost-all-power-to-companies][reduces the power of government], which in turn increases \x[social-inequality]. This idea is very well highlighted in \x[can-t-get-you-out-of-my-head-by-adam-curtis-2021].

The only solution seems to be for governments to get together, and make deals to have fair taxation across each other. Which might never happen.

Once upon a time in the 2010's, \x[ciro-santilli] went to an artsy theatre venue in the suburbia of \x[paris], dragged by his \x[ciro-santilli-s-wife][wife then girlfriend] of course.

In the venue, there was a politician, who was doing his best to show how much they supported the arts, and there were of course the artists, involved in the play.

The politician would see a political power score on top of every person's head, and would spend an amount of time talking to each person exactly proportional to that score. This meant basically one sentence to us. The words themselves didn't really matter of course, only the time spent, they just have to produce nice sounds.

One of the artists however, and he seemed quite important in the production, for some reason spent a huge amount of time speaking to us. The score the artist saw on our heads was of love, or how interested we were in the art.

Trump's election was an act of protest by the people, because they felt, and rightly so, that the promises by the \x[democrat]{p} to decrease \x[social-inequality] were just full of \x[shit].

So instead, the old voice of \x[nationalism] spoke louder.

Ciro agrees with analysis of \x[can-t-get-you-out-of-my-head-by-adam-curtis-2021] that this is largely because \x[governments-have-lost-all-power-to-companies][government is losing all power to do anything meaningful]. So the only thing left to do is to speak empty words to calm, or exacerbate, people's fears and hopes.

Ciro believes it is important not hate Trump and his believers, no matter how disgusting Trump might seem, a large part of which is likely theater. We have to try and understand them instead.

Trump's election shows clearly how the \x[democrat]{p} let down the poor. This understanding is a good thing. It shows that we all have to make greater efforts to help the poor. Just voting for some random democrat candidate who doesn't really care every four years is not enough.

Another positive point of Trump's election is that it further highlighted the power of \x[social-media] even further: it now feels more likely than ever before that anyone can run for office, since a president without any previous political office was elected (of course, being filthy reach helps a lot still, which is a problem). And this further highlights the need for regulate \x[social-media], to prevent events such as \x[the-deplatforming-of-donald-trump]

We should calmly analyze and understand how someone that tries their best to appear disgusting managed to win. Some interesting analyses of Trump's character:
* https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/ The Mind of Donald Trump by Dan P. McAdams (2016):
  \Q[It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage.

  "It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump," Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.]
  and the author comments:
  \Q[My aim is to develop a dispassionate and analytical perspective on Trump, drawing upon some of the most important ideas and research findings in psychological science today.]
  which is exactly the right way to approach things.

    You really want to know what I consider ideal company?," Trump replied. "A total piece of ass."]
* corruption

You explained away those donations saying you did that to get business related favors. And you said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.

TRUMP: You better believe it... I will tell you that our system is broken. I gave to many people. Before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman. I give to everybody. When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them, two years later, three years later, I call them. They are there for me. And that's a broken system.]

\x[ciro-santilli]'s favorite religion. He does not believe fully in it, nor has he studied it besides through brief Wikipedia and \x[google][Googling].

Ciro likes Buddhism because it feels like the least "metaphysical explanations to things you can't see" of the religions he knows.

Rather, it feels more like "a plausible theory of the mind" and \x[physics-and-the-illusion-of-life][highly compatible with physics].

Instead of just talking, those people really go out, and put food on the plate for anyone who needs it (or even for those that don't really need it! Although who would be so souless to eat for free and not donate a few bucks if they can afford to???). There's a beauty to that.

\x[ciro-santilli] believes it generally hurts more than it helps.

Especially when you can't even mention censored things to criticize them. You have to pretend they never existed. So people will forget about them, and do them again in the future.

And when companies do it just to look good, even though it has absolutely no real impact on the lives of those who are discriminated against.

The words "whitelist" and "blacklist" were also targeted.

This is notably what the \x[united-states] emerged to be after \x[world-war-ii]. But it was likely what \x[nazi-germany] also was, and many other superpowers.

The addition of congress/\x[politician]{p} is also relevant.

On one hand, yes, we need knowledge at all levels, and it is fine to start \x[backward-design][top-to-bottom] with an overview.

The problem is, however, that there is a huge knowledge gap between the one liner "this is the truth" and the much more important "this is how we know it, these are the experiments" as mentioned at \x[how-to-teach-and-learn-physics].

Therefore, if you have that extremely rare knowledge, you should be writing that in addition to the dumbed down version with an \x[open-knowledge] license. It takes time, but that's what really changes the world.

\x[ciro-santilli] has always felt that there is a huge gap between "the very basic" and "the very advanced", as mentioned at: \x[the-missing-link-between-basic-and-advanced]{full}, which existing scientific vulgarization is not doing enough to address. In a sense, filling out this "\x[the-correlation-between-software-engineers-and-buddhism][middle path]" is the main goal of \x[ourbigbook-com].

Ciro really enjoyed the description of the "Arindam Kumar Chatterjee" \x[youtube-channel]:
\Q[Theoretical/mathematical physics at the graduate level and above. This is NOT a popular science channel. Here you find real theoretical physicists doing real theoretical physics. We think it is important for people to get a taste of the real deal, and for aspiring theoretical physicists to see what they are working towards, i.e., to provide the public with something beyond the ubiquitous Michio Kaku and Brian Cox.]

One thing must be said however: there seems to be an actual bias against researchers tho try to create vulgarization material: \x[how-to-get-tenure-at-a-major-research-university-by-sean-carroll-2011], and that is terrible.

There is often \x[there-is-value-in-tutorials-written-by-beginners][more value in a tutorial by a beginner who is trying to fully learn and explain a subject], than by an expert who is trying to "dumb it down" too much.
