= Relativistic quantum mechanics
{wiki}

The first really good \x[quantum-mechanics] theory made compatible with \x[special-relativity] was the \x[dirac-equation].

And then came \x[quantum-electrodynamics] to improve it: \x[dirac-equation-vs-quantum-electrodynamics].

TODO: does it use full blown QED, or just something intermediate?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtnsHtYYKf0 "Mercury and Relativity - Periodic Table of Videos" by \x[periodic-videos] (2013). Doesn't give the key juicy details/intuition. Also mentioned on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_quantum_chemistry#Mercury

Adds \x[special-relativity] to the \x[schrodinger-equation], and the following conclusions come basically as a direct consequence of this!

Experiments explained:
* \x[spontaneous-emission] coefficients.
* \x[fine-structure], notably for example \x[dirac-equation-solution-for-the-hydrogen-atom]
* \x[antimatter]
* \x[particle-creation-and-annihilation]

Experiments not explained: those that \x[quantum-electrodynamics] explains like:
* \x[lamb-shift]
* TODO: quantization of the electromagnetic field as \x[photon]{p}?

The Dirac equation is a set of 4 \x[partial-differential-equation]{p} on 4 \x[complex-number][complex valued] wave functions. The full explicit form in \x[planck-units] is shown e.g. in \x[video-quantum-mechanics-12a-dirac-equation-i-by-viascience-2015] at https://youtu.be/OCuaBmAzqek?t=1010[]:
$$

{parent=dirac-equation}

Do electrons spontaneously jump from high orbitals to lower ones emitting photons?

Explaining this was was one of the key initial achievements of the \x[dirac-equation].

Yes, but this is not predicted by the \x[schrodinger-equation], you need to go to the \x[dirac-equation].

A critical application of this phenomena is \x[laser].

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation

Predicted by the \x[dirac-equation].

We've likely known since forever that \x[photon]{p} are created: just turn on a light and see gazillion of them come out!

Photon creation is easy because photons are massless, so there is not minimum energy to create them.

The creation of other particles is much rarer however, and took longer to be discovered, one notable milestone being the discovery of the \x[positron].

In the case of the electron, we need to start with at least enough energy for the mass of the electron positron pair. This requires a photon with wavelength in the \x[picometer] range, which is not common in the thermal radiation of daily life.

= Derivation of the Dirac equation
{parent=dirac-equation}

The \x[dirac-equation] can be derived basically "directly" from the \x[representation-theory-of-the-lorentz-group] for the \x[spin-half] representation, this is shown for example at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] 6.3 "Dirac Equation".

The Diract equation is the \x[spacetime-symmetry] part of the \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian], i.e. is describes how \x[spin-half] particles behave without interactions. The full \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian] can then be reached by adding the \x[u-1] \x[internal-symmetry].

As mentioned at \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics], this same method allows us to analogously derive the equations for other \x[spin-number]{p}.

{parent=dirac-equation}

A relativistic version of the \x[schrodinger-equation].

Correctly describes \x[spin-0] particles.

The most memorable version of the equation can be written as shown at \x[klein-gordon-equation-in-einstein-notation]{full} with \x[einstein-notation] and \x[planck-units]:
$$
\partial_i \partial^i \psi - m^2 \psi = 0
$$

Has some issues which are solved by the \x[dirac-equation]:
* it has a second time derivative of the \x[wave-function]. Therefore, to solve it we must specify not only the initial value of the wave equation, but also the derivative of the wave equation, 

  As mentioned at \x[advanced-quantum-mechanics-by-freeman-dyson-1951] and further clarified at: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/340023/cant-the-negative-probabilities-of-klein-gordon-equation-be-avoided[], this would lead to negative probabilities.
* the modulus of the wave function is not constant and therefore not always one, and therefore cannot be interpreted as a probability density anymore
* since we are working with the square of the energy, we have both positive and negative value solutions. This is also a features of the \x[dirac-equation] however.

= Derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation
{c}
{parent=klein-gordon-equation}

The Klein-Gordon equation directly uses a more naive \x[relativistic-energy] guess of $p^2 + m^2$ squared.

But since this is \x[quantum-mechanics], we feel like making $p$ into the "\x[momentum-operator]", just like in the \x[schrodinger-equation].

But we don't really know how to apply the momentum operator twice, because it is a \x[gradient], so the first application goes from a scalar field to the vector field, and the second one...

So we just cheat and try to use the \x[laplace-operator] instead because there's some squares on it:
$$
H = \laplacian{} + m^2
$$

But then, we have to avoid taking the square root to reach a first derivative in time, because we don't know how to take the square root of that operator expression.

So the Klein-Gordon equation just takes the approach of using this squared Hamiltonian instead.

Since it is a Hamiltonian, and comparing it to the \x[schrodinger-equation] which looks like:
$$
H \psi = i \pdv{\psi}{t}
$$
taking the Hamiltonian twice leads to:
$$
H^2 \psi = - \pdv{^2 \psi}{^2 t}
$$

We can contrast this with the \x[dirac-equation], which instead attempts to explicitly construct an operator which squared coincides with the relativistic formula: \x[derivation-of-the-dirac-equation].

= Spin
{disambiguate=physics}
{parent=dirac-equation}

Spin is one of the \x[defining-properties-of-elementary-particles], i.e. number that describes how an \x[elementary-particle] behaves, much like \x[electric-charge] and \x[mass].

Possible values are half integer numbers: 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and so on.

The approach shown in this section: \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics]{c}{full} shows what the spin number actually means in general. As shown there, the spin number it is a direct consequence of having the laws of nature be \x[lorentz-invariant]. Different spin numbers are just different ways in which this can be achieved as per different \x[representation-of-the-lorentz-group].

\x[video-quantum-mechanics-9a-photon-spin-and-schrodinger-s-cat-i-by-viascience-2013] explains nicely how:
* incorporated into the \x[dirac-equation] as a natural consequence of \x[special-relativity] corrections, but not naturally present in the \x[schrodinger-equation], see also: \x[the-dirac-equation-predicts-spin]{child}
* \x[photon] spin can be either linear or circular
* the linear one can be made from a superposition of circular ones
* straight antennas produce linearly polarized photos, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helical_antenna[Helical antennas] circularly polarized ones
* a jump between 2s and 2p in an atom changes angular momentum. Therefore, the photon must carry angular momentum as well as energy.
* cannot be classically explained, because even for a very large estimate of the electron size, its surface would have to spin faster than light to achieve that magnetic momentum with the known \x[electron-charge]
* as shown at \x[video-quantum-mechanics-12b-dirac-equation-ii-by-viascience-2015], observers in different \x[frame-of-reference][frames of reference] see different spin states

Best mathematical explanation: \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics]{c}{full}.

\x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 3.9 "Elementary particles" has an amazing summary of the preceding chapters the \x[spin-physics] value has a relation to the \x[representation-theory][representations] of the \x[lorentz-group], which encodes the \x[spacetime-symmetry] that each particle observes. These symmetries can be characterized by small integer numbers:
* \x[spin-0]: $(0, 0)$ representation
* \x[spin-half]: $(1/2, 0) \bigoplus (0, 1/2)$ representation
* \x[spin-1]: $(1/2, 1/2)$ representation
\x[parameters-of-the-standard-model][As usual], we don't know why there aren't \x[elementary-particle]{p} with other spins, as we could construct them.
