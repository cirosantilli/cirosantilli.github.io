= Relativistic quantum mechanics
{wiki}

The first really good \x[quantum-mechanics] theory made compatible with \x[special-relativity] was the \x[dirac-equation].

And then came \x[quantum-electrodynamics] to improve it: \x[dirac-equation-vs-quantum-electrodynamics].

TODO: does it use full blown QED, or just something intermediate?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtnsHtYYKf0 "Mercury and Relativity - Periodic Table of Videos" by \x[periodic-videos] (2013). Doesn't give the key juicy details/intuition. Also mentioned on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_quantum_chemistry#Mercury

Adds \x[special-relativity] to the \x[schrodinger-equation], and the following conclusions come basically as a direct consequence of this!

Experiments explained:
* \x[spontaneous-emission] coefficients.
* \x[fine-structure], notably for example \x[dirac-equation-solution-for-the-hydrogen-atom]
* \x[antimatter]

* \x[lamb-shift]
* TODO: quantization of the electromagnetic field as \x[photon]{p}?

The Dirac equation is a set of 4 \x[partial-differential-equation]{p} on 4 \x[complex-number][complex valued] wave functions. The full explicit form in \x[planck-units] is shown e.g. in \x[video-quantum-mechanics-12a-dirac-equation-i-by-viascience-2015] at https://youtu.be/OCuaBmAzqek?t=1010[]:

Do electrons spontaneously jump from high orbitals to lower ones emitting photons?

Explaining this was was one of the key initial achievements of the \x[dirac-equation].

Yes, but this is not predicted by the \x[schrodinger-equation], you need to go to the \x[dirac-equation].

A critical application of this phenomena is \x[laser].

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation

Predicted by the \x[dirac-equation].

We've likely known since forever that \x[photon]{p} are created: just turn on a light and see gazillion of them come out!

Photon creation is easy because photons are massless, so there is not minimum energy to create them.

The creation of other particles is much rarer however, and took longer to be discovered, one notable milestone being the discovery of the \x[positron].

In the case of the electron, we need to start with at least enough energy for the mass of the electron positron pair. This requires a photon with wavelength in the \x[picometer] range, which is not common in the thermal radiation of daily life.

= Derivation of the Dirac equation
{parent=dirac-equation}

The \x[dirac-equation] can be derived basically "directly" from the \x[representation-theory-of-the-lorentz-group] for the \x[spin-half] representation, this is shown for example at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] 6.3 "Dirac Equation".

The Diract equation is the \x[spacetime-symmetry] part of the \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian], i.e. is describes how \x[spin-half] particles behave without interactions. The full \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian] can then be reached by adding the \x[u-1] \x[internal-symmetry].

As mentioned at \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics], this same method allows us to analogously derive the equations for other \x[spin-number]{p}.

A relativistic version of the \x[schrodinger-equation].

Correctly describes \x[spin-0] particles.

The most memorable version of the equation can be written as shown at \x[klein-gordon-equation-in-einstein-notation]{full} with \x[einstein-notation] and \x[planck-units]:
$$
\partial_i \partial^i \psi - m^2 \psi = 0
$$

Has some issues which are solved by the \x[dirac-equation]:
* it has a second time derivative of the \x[wave-function]. Therefore, to solve it we must specify not only the initial value of the wave equation, but also the derivative of the wave equation, 

  As mentioned at \x[advanced-quantum-mechanics-by-freeman-dyson-1951] and further clarified at: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/340023/cant-the-negative-probabilities-of-klein-gordon-equation-be-avoided[], this would lead to negative probabilities.
* the modulus of the wave function is not constant and therefore not always one, and therefore cannot be interpreted as a probability density anymore
* since we are working with the square of the energy, we have both positive and negative value solutions. This is also a features of the \x[dirac-equation] however.

= Derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation
{c}
{parent=klein-gordon-equation}

The Klein-Gordon equation directly uses a more naive \x[relativistic-energy] guess of $p^2 + m^2$ squared.

But since this is \x[quantum-mechanics], we feel like making $p$ into the "\x[momentum-operator]", just like in the \x[schrodinger-equation].

But we don't really know how to apply the momentum operator twice, because it is a \x[gradient], so the first application goes from a scalar field to the vector field, and the second one...

So we just cheat and try to use the \x[laplace-operator] instead because there's some squares on it:
$$
H = \laplacian{} + m^2
$$

But then, we have to avoid taking the square root to reach a first derivative in time, because we don't know how to take the square root of that operator expression.

So the Klein-Gordon equation just takes the approach of using this squared Hamiltonian instead.

Since it is a Hamiltonian, and comparing it to the \x[schrodinger-equation] which looks like:
$$
H \psi = i \pdv{\psi}{t}
$$
taking the Hamiltonian twice leads to:
$$
H^2 \psi = - \pdv{^2 \psi}{^2 t}
$$

We can contrast this with the \x[dirac-equation], which instead attempts to explicitly construct an operator which squared coincides with the relativistic formula: \x[derivation-of-the-dirac-equation].

= Spin
{disambiguate=physics}
{parent=dirac-equation}

Spin is one of the \x[defining-properties-of-elementary-particles], i.e. number that describes how an \x[elementary-particle] behaves, much like \x[electric-charge] and \x[mass].

Possible values are half integer numbers: 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and so on.

The approach shown in this section: \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics]{c}{full} shows what the spin number actually means in general. As shown there, the spin number it is a direct consequence of having the laws of nature be \x[lorentz-invariant]. Different spin numbers are just different ways in which this can be achieved as per different \x[representation-of-the-lorentz-group].

\x[video-quantum-mechanics-9a-photon-spin-and-schrodinger-s-cat-i-by-viascience-2013] explains nicely how:
* incorporated into the \x[dirac-equation] as a natural consequence of \x[special-relativity] corrections, but not naturally present in the \x[schrodinger-equation], see also: \x[the-dirac-equation-predicts-spin]{child}
* \x[photon] spin can be either linear or circular
* the linear one can be made from a superposition of circular ones
* straight antennas produce linearly polarized photos, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helical_antenna[Helical antennas] circularly polarized ones
* a jump between 2s and 2p in an atom changes angular momentum. Therefore, the photon must carry angular momentum as well as energy.
* cannot be classically explained, because even for a very large estimate of the electron size, its surface would have to spin faster than light to achieve that magnetic momentum with the known \x[electron-charge]
* as shown at \x[video-quantum-mechanics-12b-dirac-equation-ii-by-viascience-2015], observers in different \x[frame-of-reference][frames of reference] see different spin states

Best mathematical explanation: \x[spin-comes-naturally-when-adding-relativity-to-quantum-mechanics]{c}{full}.

\x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 3.9 "Elementary particles" has an amazing summary of the preceding chapters the \x[spin-physics] value has a relation to the \x[representation-theory][representations] of the \x[lorentz-group], which encodes the \x[spacetime-symmetry] that each particle observes. These symmetries can be characterized by small integer numbers:
* \x[spin-0]: $(0, 0)$ representation
* \x[spin-half]: $(1/2, 0) \bigoplus (0, 1/2)$ representation
* \x[spin-1]: $(1/2, 1/2)$ representation

Theoretical framework on which quantum field theories are based, theories based on framework include:
* \x[quantum-electrodynamics]
* \x[quantum-chromodynamics]
so basically the entire \x[standard-model]

The basic idea is that there is a field for each particle particle type.

E.g. in QED, one for the \x[electron] and one for the \x[photon]: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/166709/are-electron-fields-and-photon-fields-part-of-the-same-field-in-qed[].

And then those fields interact with some \x[lagrangian].

One way to look at QFT is to split it into two parts:
* deriving the Lagrangians of the \x[standard-model]: \x[why-do-symmetries-such-as-su-3-su-2-and-u-1-matter-in-particle-physics]. This is the easier part, since the lagrangians themselves can be understood with not very advanced mathematics, and derived beautifully from symmetry constraints
* the qantization of fields. This is the hard part \x[ciro-santilli] is unable to understand, TODO \x[mathematical-formulation-of-quantum-field-theory].
Then interwined with those two is the part "OK, how to solve the equations, if they are solvable at all", which is an open problem: \x[yang-mills-existence-and-mass-gap].

There appear to be two main equivalent formulations of quantum field theory:
* \x[second-quantization]
* \x[path-integral-formulation]

But what the heck is the mathematical model for a quantum field theory? TODO someone was saying it is equivalent to an infinite set of PDEs somehow. Investigate. Related:

The \x[path-integral-formulation] might actually be the most understandable formulation, as shown at \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].

The formulation of QFT also appears to be a form of infinite-dimentional calculus.

\x[quantum-electrodynamics-by-lifshitz-et-al-2nd-edition-1982] chapter 1. "The uncertainty principle in the relativistic case" contains an interesting idea:
\Q[The foregoing discussion suggests that the theory will not consider the time dependence of particle interaction processes. It will show that in these processes there are no characteristics precisely definable (even within the usual limitations of quantum mechanics); the description of such a process as occurring in the course of time is therefore just as unreal as the classical paths are in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The only observable quantities are the properties (momenta,
polarizations) of free particles: the initial particles which come into interaction, and the final particles which result from the process.]

The term and idea was first introduced initialized by \x[hermann-weyl] when he was working on combining \x[electromagnetism] and \x[general-relativity] to formulate \x[maxwell-s-equations-in-curved-spacetime] in 1918 and published as \x[gravity-and-electricity-by-hermann-weyl-1918]. Based on perception that \x[u-1] symmetry implies \x[charge-conservation]. The same idea was later adapted for \x[quantum-electrodynamics], a context in which is has even more impact.

Second quantization also appears to be useful not only for \x[relativistic-quantum-mechanics], but also for \x[condensed-matter-physics]. The reason is that the basis idea is to use the number occupation basis. This basis is:
* convenient for \x[quantum-field-theory] because of \x[particle-creation-and-annihilation] changes the number of particles all the time
* convenient for \x[condensed-matter-physics] because there you have a gazillion particles occupying entire \x[electronic-band-theory][energy bands]

This one might actually be understandable! It is what \x[richard-feynman] starts to explain at: \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].

The difficulty is then proving that the total probability remains at 1, and maybe causality is hard too.

The path integral formulation can be seen as a generalization of the \x[double-slit-experiment] to infinitely many slits.

Feynman first stared working it out for \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics], with the relativistic goal in mind, and only later on he attained the relativistic goal.

TODO why intuitively did he take that approach? Likely is makes it easier to add \x[special-relativity].

This approach more directly suggests the idea that \x[quantum-particles-take-all-possible-paths].

Theory that describes \x[electron]{p} and \x[photon]{p} really well, and \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979][as Feynman puts it] "accounts very precisely for all physical phenomena we have ever observed, except for gravity and nuclear physics" ("including the laughter of the crowd" ;-)).

Learning it is one of \x[ciro-santilli]'s main intellectual \x[fetish]{p}.

While Ciro acknowledges that QED is intrinsically challenging due to the wide range or requirements (\x[quantum-mechanics], \x[special-relativity] and \x[electromagnetism]), Ciro feels that there is a glaring gap in this moneyless market for a learning material that follows the \x[middle-way] as mentioned at: \x[the-missing-link-between-basic-and-advanced]. \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979] is one of the best attempts so far, but it falls a bit too close to the superficial side of things, if only Feynman hadn't assumed that the audience doesn't know any mathematics...

The funny thing is that when \x[ciro-santilli-s-mother] retired, learning it (or as she put it: "how photons and electrons interact") was also one of her retirement plans. She is a pharmacist by training, and doesn't know much \x[mathematics], and her \x[english-language] was \x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world][somewhat limited]. Oh, she also wanted to learn how \x[photosynthesis] works (possibly not fully understood by science as that time, 2020). Ambitious old lady!!!

Experiments: \x[quantum-electrodynamics-experiments].

Combines \x[special-relativity] with more classical \x[quantum-mechanics], but further generalizing the \x[dirac-equation], which also does that: \x[dirac-equation-vs-quantum-electrodynamics].

Before QED, the most advanced theory was that of the \x[dirac-equation], which was already relativistic but TODO what was missing there exactly?

As summarized at: https://youtube.com/watch?v=_AZdvtf6hPU?t=305[] Quantum Field Theory lecture at the African Summer Theory Institute 1 of 4 by Anthony Zee (2004):
* classical mechanics describes large and slow objects
* special relativity describes large and fast objects (they are getting close to the speed of light, so we have to consider relativity)
* classical \x[quantum-mechanics] describes small and slow objects.
* QED describes objects that are both small and fast

That video also mentions the interesting idea that:
* in special relativity, we have the \x[mass-energy-equivalence]
* in quantum mechanics, thinking along the \x[time-energy-uncertainty-principle], $\Delta E \sim \frac{1}{\Delta t}$
Therefore, for small timescales, energy can vary a lot. But mass is equivalent to energy. Therefore, for small time scale, particles can appear and disappear wildly.

QED is the first \x[quantum-field-theory] fully developed. That framework was later extended to also include the \x[weak-interaction] and \x[strong-interaction]. As a result, it is perhaps easier to just \x[google] for "Quantum Field Theory" if you want to learn QED, since QFT is more general and has more resources available generally.

Like in more general quantum field theory, there is on field for each particle type. In quantum field theory, there are only two fields to worry about:
* \x[photon] field
* \x[electromagnetism] field

where:
* $F$ is the \x[electromagnetic-tensor]

Note that this is the sum of the:
* \x[dirac-lagrangian], which  only describes the "inertia of bodies" part of the equation

Note that the relationship between $\psi$ and $F$ is not explicit. However, if we knew what type of particle we were talking about, e.g. \x[electron], then the knowledge of \x[psi] would also give the charge distribution and therefore $F$

As mentioned at the beginning of \x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-notes-by-david-tong-2007]:

{title=Deriving the \x[qed-lagrangian] by \x[dietterich-labs] (2018)}
{description=As mentioned at the start of the video, he starts with the \x[dirac-equation] Lagrangian derived in a previous video. It has nothing to do with \x[electromagnetism] specifically.

He notes that that \x[dirac-lagrangian], besides being globally \x[lorentz-invariant], it also also has a global \x[u-1] invariance.

However, it does not have a local invariance if the \x[u-1] transformation depends on the point in spacetime.

He doesn't mention it, but I think this is highly desirable, because in general \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents], and in this case we want conservation of charges.

To fix that, he adds an extra \x[gauge-field] $A_\mu$ (a field of $4 \times 4$ matrices) to the regular derivative, and the resulting derivative has a fancy name: the \x[covariant-derivative].

Then finally he notes that this \x[gauge-field] he had to add has to transform exactly like the \x[electromagnetic-four-potential]!

So he uses that as the gauge, and also adds in the \x[maxwell-lagrangian] in the same go. It is kind of a guess, but it is a natural guess, and it turns out to be correct.

= What does it mean that photons are force carriers for electromagnetism?
{parent=quantum-electrodynamics}

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/61095/photon-as-the-carrier-of-the-electromagnetic-force

TODO find/create decent answer.

I think the best answer is something along:
* \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents]. $U(1)$ gives conserved charges.
* OK now. We want a local $U(1)$ symmetry. And we also want:
  * \x[dirac-equation]: quantum relativistic Newton's laws that specify what forces do to the fields
  * \x[electromagnetism]: specifies what causes forces based on currents. But not what it does to masses.
  Given all of that, the most obvious and direct thing we reach a guess at the \x[quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian] is \x[video-deriving-the-qed-lagrangian-by-dietterich-labs-2018]

A basic non-precise intuition is that a good model of reality is that electrons do not "interact with one another directly via the electromagnetic field".

A better model happens to be the \x[quantum-field-theory] view that the electromagnetic field interacts with the photon field but not directly with itself, and then the photon field interacts with parts of the electromagnetic field further away.

The more precise statement is that the \x[photon-field] is a gauge field of the electromagnetic force under local U(1) symmetry, which is described by a \x[lie-group]. TODO understand.

This idea was first applied in \x[general-relativity], where \x[einstein] understood that the "force of \x[gravity]" can be understood just in terms of symmetry and curvature of space. This was later applied o \x[quantum-electrodynamics] and the entire \x[standard-model].

From \x[video-lorenzo-sadun-on-the-yang-mills-and-mass-gap-millennium-problem]:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCQ9GIqpGBI&t=1663s mentions this idea first came about from \x[hermann-weyl].

By \x[richard-feynman]{parent}.

Talk title shown on intro: "Today's Answers to Newton's Queries about Light".

6 hour lecture, where he tries to explain it to an audience that does not know any modern physics. This is a noble effort.

Part of The Douglas Robb Memorial Lectures lecture series.

Feynman apparently also made a book adaptation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED:_The_Strange_Theory_of_Light_and_Matter[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]. That book is basically word by word the same as the presentation, including the diagrams.

According to http://www.feynman.com/science/qed-lectures-in-new-zealand/ the official upload is at http://www.vega.org.uk/video/subseries/8[] and Vega does show up as a watermark on the video (though it is too pixilated to guess without knowing it), a project that has been discontinued and has has a non-permissive license. Newbs.

4 parts:
* Part 1: is saying "\x[photon]{p} exist"
* Part 2: is amazing, and describes how photons move as a sum of all possible paths, not sure if it is relativistic at all though, and suggests that something is minimized in that calculation (the \x[action-physics])
* Part 3: is where he hopelessly tries to explain the crucial part of how electrons join the picture in a similar manner to how photons do.

  He does make the link to light, saying that there is a function $P(A, B)$ which gives the amplitude for a photon going from A to B, where A and B are spacetime events.

  And then he mentions that there is a similar function $E(A, B)$ for an electron to go from A to B, but says that that function is too complicated, and gives no intuition unlike the photon one.

  He does not mention it, but P and E are the so called \x[propagator]{p}.

  This is likely the \x[path-integral-formulation] of QED.

  On \x[quantum-mechanical-view-of-reality-by-richard-feynman-1983] he mentions that $E$ is a \x[bessel-function], without giving further detail.

  And also mentions that:
  $$
  E = f(1, 2, m) \\
  P = f(1, 2, 0)
  $$
  where `m` is basically a scale factor.
  such that both are very similar. And that something similar holds for many other particles.

  And then, when you draw a \x[feynman-diagram], e.g. electron emits photon and both are detected at given positions, you sum over all the possibilities, each amplitude is given by:
  $$
  c \times E(A, D) \times E(D, B) \times P(B, C)
  $$
  summed over all possible $D$ \x[spacetime] points.

  This is basically well said at: https://youtu.be/rZvgGekvHes?t=3349 from \x[quantum-mechanical-view-of-reality-by-richard-feynman-1983].

  TODO: how do electron velocities affect where they are likely to end up? $E(A, D)$ suggests the probability only depends on the spacetime points.

  Also, this clarifies why computations in QED are so insane: you have to sum over every possible point in space!!! TODO but then how do we calculate anything at all in practice?
* Part 4: known problems with QED and thoughts on QCD. Boring.

Basically the same content as: \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979], but maybe there is some merit to this talk, as it is a bit more direct in some points. This is consistent with what is mentioned at http://www.feynman.com/science/qed-lectures-in-new-zealand/ that the Auckland lecture was the first attempt.

They are mostly a \x[new-age] production company it seems, which highlights Feynman's absolute cult status. E.g. on the last video, he's not wearing shoes, like a proper guru.

Feynman liked to meet all kinds of weird people, and at some point he got interested in the \x[new-age] \x[esalen-institute]. \x[surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman] this kind of experience a bit, there was nude bathing on a pool that oversaw the sea, and a guy offered to give a massage to the he nude girl and the accepted.

https://youtu.be/rZvgGekvHest=5105 actually talks about \x[spin-physics], notably that the endpoint events also have a spin, and that the transition rules take spin into account by rotating thing, and that the transition rules take spin into account by rotating things.

= Weak force
{synonym}

Explains \x[beta-decay]. TODO why/how.

Maybe a good view of why this force was needed given \x[beta-decay] experiments is: in beta decay, a \x[neutron] is getting split up into an \x[electron] and a \x[proton]. Therefore, those charges must be contained inside the neutron somehow to start with. But then what could possibly make a positive and a negative particle separate?
* the \x[electromagnetic-force] should hold them together
* the \x[strong-force] seems to hold positive charges together. Could it then be pushing opposite-charges apart? Why not?
* \x[gravity] is too weak

http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/Weak-nuclear-force.html gives a quick and dirty:
\Q[
Beta decay could not be explained by the strong nuclear force, the force that's responsible for holding the atomic nucleus together, because this force doesn't affect electrons. It couldn't be explained by the electromagnetic force, because this does not affect \x[neutron]{p}, and the force of \x[gravity] is far too weak to be responsible. Since this new atomic force was not as strong as the strong nuclear force, it was dubbed the weak nuclear force.
]
Also interesting:
\Q[
While the photon 'carries' charge, and therefore mediates the \x[electromagnetic-force], the \x[z-boson][Z] and \x[w-boson][W] \x[boson]{p} are said to carry a property known as 'weak isospin'. \x[w-boson]{p} mediate the weak force when particles with charge are involved, and \x[z-boson]{p} mediate the weak force when neutral particles are involved.

{parent=quantum-field-theory}

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/106392/internal-and-spacetime-symmetries

The different only shows up for \x[field-physics], not with particles. For fields, there are two types of changes that we can make that can keep the \x[lagrangian] unchanged as mentioned at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter "4.5.2 Noether's Theorem for Field Theories - Spacetime":
* \x[spacetime-symmetry]: act with the \x[poincare-group] on the \x[four-vector] spacetime inputs of the field itself, i.e. transforming $L(\Phi(x), \partial \Phi(x), dx)$ into $L(\Phi'(x'), \partial \Phi'(x'), x')$
* \x[internal-symmetry]: act on the output of the  field, i.e.: $L(\Phi(x) + \delta \Phi(x), \partial (\Phi(x) + \delta \Phi(x)), x)$

From \x[defining-properties-of-elementary-particles]:
* spacetime:
  * \x[mass]
  * \x[spin-physics]
* internal
  * \x[electric-charge]
  * \x[weak-charge]
  * \x[color-charge]

From the spacetime theory alone, we can derive the \x[lagrangian] for the free theories for each \x[spin-physics]:
* \x[spin-0]: \x[klein-gordon-equation]
* \x[spin-half]: \x[dirac-equation]
* \x[spin-1]: \x[proca-equation]
Then the internal symmetries are what add the interaction part of the \x[lagrangian], which then completes the \x[standard-model-lagrangian].

Non-relativistic \x[qft] is a limit of relativistic QFT, and can be used to describe for example \x[condensed-matter-physics] systems at very low temperature. But it is still very hard to make accurate measurements even in those experiments.

Defines "relativistic" as: "the \x[lagrangian] is symmetric under the \x[poincare-group]".

Mentions that "QFT is hard" because (a finite list follows???):
\Q[There are no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary \x[representation-theory][representations] of the \x[poincare-group].]
But I guess that if you fully understand what that means precisely, QTF won't be too hard for you!

Notably, this is stark contrast with rotation symmetry groups (\x[special-orthogonal-group][SO(3)]) which appears in space rotations present in \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics].

* https://youtu.be/fnMcaq6QqTY?t=1179 remembers how to solve the non-field \x[quantum-harmonic-oscillator]
* https://youtu.be/fnMcaq6QqTY?t=2008 puts hats on everything to make the field version of things. With the \x[klein-gordon-equation] \x[hamiltonian], everything is analogous to the harmonic oscilator

= No-Nonsense Quantum Field Theory: A Student-Friendly Introduction by Jakob Schwichtenberg (2020)
{parent=quantum-field-theory-book}

This book really tries to recall basic things to ensure that the reader will be able to understand the more advanced ones.

Sometimes it goes a little bit overboard, like defining what a\x[function] does several times.

But \x[ciro-santilli] really prefers it when authors error on the side of obvious.

{parent=quantum-field-theory-book}

Author: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Zee from \x[university-of-california-santa-barbara].

ISBN-13: 978-0691140346

\x[amazon-company]: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691140340

\x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-by-tobias-osborne-2017/lecture-1] mentions that this book is quick and dirty, as one might guess from the title. \x[ciro-santilli] thinks he's gonna like this one.

First edition: from 2003, https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691010196[], ISBN-13: 978-0691010199.

= Quantum Field Theory Demystified by David McMahon (2008)
{parent=quantum-field-theory-book}

This didn't really deliver. It does start from the basics, but it is often hard to link those basics to more interesting or deeper points. Also like many other \x[quantum-field-theory-book], it does not seem to contain a single comparison between a theoretical result and an experiment.

{parent=quantum-field-theory-book}

https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Quantum-Theory-Frontiers-Physics/dp/0201503972

This is very widely used in courses as of 2020, it became kind of the default book.

Unfortunately, this approach bores \x[ciro-santilli] to death. Or perhaps is too \x[the-missing-link-between-basic-and-advanced][just advanced for him to appreciate]. Either of those.

800+ pages.
