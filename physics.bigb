Physics is the \x[art] of predicting the future by modelling the world with \x[mathematics].

\x[ciro-santilli] doesn't know physics. He writes about it partly to start playing with some scientific content for: \x[ourbigbook-com], partly because this stuff is just amazingly beautiful.

Ciro's main intellectual \x[physics] \x[fetish]{p} are to learn \x[quantum-electrodynamics] (understanding the point of \x[lie-group]{p} being a subpart of that) and \x[condensed-matter-physics].

Every science \x[reductionism][is Physics in disguise], but the number of objects in the real world is so large that we can't solve the real equations in practice.

Luckily, due to \x[emergence], we can use uglier higher level approximations of the world to solve many problems, with the complex limits of applicability of those approximations.

Therefore, such higher level approximations are highly specialized, and given different names such as:
* \x[chemistry]
* \x[biology]

As of 2019, all known physics can be described by two theories:
* the \x[standard-model]
* \x[general-relativity]

Unifying those two into the \x[theory-of-everything] one of the major goals of modern physics.

= How to teach and learn physics
{parent=physics}
{tag=essays-by-ciro-santilli}

The approach many courses take to physics, specially "modern Physics" is really bad, this is how it should be taught:
* start by describing experiments that the previous best theory did not explain. This gets intimately entangled with basically learning the \x[history-of-physics], which is extremely beneficial as also highlighted by \x[ron-maimon], and also because \x[there-is-value-in-tutorials-written-by-early-pioneers-of-the-field].

  In the \x[surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman-chapter-o-americano-outra-vez] \x[richard-feynman] describes his experience teaching in \x[brazil] in the early 1950s, and how everything was memorized, without any explanation of the experiments or that the theory has some relationship to the real world! Although things have improved considerably since, Ciro still feels that some areas of physics are still taught without enough experiments described upfront. Notably, ironically, \x[quantum-field-theory], which is where Feynman himself worked. Feynman gave huge importance to understanding and explaining experiments, as can also be seen on \x[richard-feynman-quantum-electrodynamics-lecture-at-university-of-auckland-1979].
* then, give the final formula for the next best theory
* then, give all the important final implications of that formula, and how it amazingly describes the experiments. In particular this means: \x[doing-physics-means-calculating-a-number]
* then, give some mathematical intuition on the formulas, and how the main equation could have been derived
* finally, then and only then, start deriving the outcomes of the main formula in detail

This is likely because at some point, experiments get more and more complicated, and so people are tempted to say "this is the truth" instead of "this is why we think this is the truth", which is much harder.

But we can't be lazy, there is no replacement to the why.

= Doing physics means calculating a number
{parent=how-to-teach-and-learn-physics}

In Physics, in order to test a theory, you must be able to extract a number from it.

It does not matter how, if it is exact, or numerical, or a message from \x[god]: a number has to come out of the formulas in the end, and you have to compare it with the experimental data.

Many theoretical physicists seem to forget this in their lectures, see also: \x[how-to-teach-and-learn-physics]{full}.

{title2=1923}
{wiki}

Classic theory predicts that the output frequency must be the same as the input one since the electromagnetic wave makes the electron vibrate with same frequency as itself, which then irradiates further waves.

But the output waves are longer because \x[planck-einstein-relation][photons are discrete and energy is proportional to frequency]:

The formula is exactly that of two \x[relativistic] billiard balls colliding.

Therefore this is evidence that \x[photon]{p} exist and have momentum.

No matter how hight the wave intensity, if it the frequency is small, no photons are removed from the material.

{title2=1947}

Published as Fine Structure of the Hydrogen Atom by a Microwave Method by \x[willis-lamb] and Robert Retherford (1947) on \x[physical-review].

\x[microwave] technology was developed in \x[world-war-ii] for \x[radar], notably at the \x[mit-radiation-laboratory]. Before that, people were using much higher frequencies such as the \x[visible-spectrum]. But to detect small energy differences, you need to look into longer wavelengths.

This experiment was fundamental to the development of \x[quantum-electrodynamics]. As mentioned at \x[genius-richard-feynman-and-modern-physics-by-james-gleick-1994] chapter "Shrinking the infinities", before the experiment, people already knew that trying to add \x[electromagnetism] to the \x[dirac-equation] led to \x[infinities-in-quantum-field-theory][infinities] using previous methods, and something needed to change urgently. However for the first time now the theorists had one precise number to try and hack their formulas to reach, not just a philosophical debate about infinities, and this led to major breakthroughs. The same book also describes the experiment briefly as:
\Q[Willis Lamb had just shined a beam of microwaves onto a hot wisp of hydrogen blowing from an oven.]

This one has open accesses as of 2021: https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.72.241

It is two pages and a half long.

They were at \x[columbia-university] in the \x[columbia-radiation-laboratory]. Robert was Willis' graduate student.

Previous less experiments had already hinted at this effect, but they were too imprecise to be sure.

As of 2019, the \x[standard-model] and \x[general-relativity] are incompatible. Once those are unified, we will have one equation to describe the entirety of \x[physics].

There are also however also unsolved problems in \x[electroweak-interaction] + \x[strong-interaction], which if achieved is referred to as a \x[grand-unified-theory]. Reaching a GUT is considered a sensible intermediate step before TOE.

The current state of Physics has been the result of several previous unifications as shown at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything#Conventional_sequence_of_theories so it is expected that this last missing unification is likely to happen one day, potentially conditional on humanity having enough energy to observe new phenomena.

= Defining properties of elementary particles
{parent=elementary-particle}

A suggested at \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 3.9 "Elementary particles", it appears that in the \x[standard-model], the behaviour of each particle can be uniquely defined by the following five numbers:
* due to \x[spacetime-symmetry]{p}:
  * \x[mass]
  * \x[spin-physics]
* due to \x[internal-symmetry]{p}:
  * \x[electric-charge]
  * \x[weak-charge]
  * \x[color-charge]

E.g. for the \x[electron] we have:
* mass: $9.1 \times 10^{-31}$
* spin: 1/2
* electric charge: $1.6 \times 10^{-29}$
* weak charge: -1/2
* color charge: 0

Once you specify these properties, you could in theory just pluck them into the \x[standard-model-lagrangian] and you could simulate what happens. 

Setting new random values for those properties would also allow us to create new particles. It appears unknown why we only see the particles that we do, and \x[parameters-of-the-standard-model][why they have the values of properties they have].

= Photon
{parent=elementary-particle}
{wiki}

Initially light was though of as a wave because it experienced interference as shown by experiments such as:
* \x[double-slit-experiment]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_rings

But then, some key experiments also start suggesting that \x[light] is made up of \x[discrete] packets:
* \x[compton-scattering], also suggests that photons carry momentum
* \x[photoelectric-effect]
* \x[single-photon-production-and-detection-experiments]
and in the understanding of the 2020 \x[standard-model] the photon is one of the \x[elementary-particle]{p}{parent}.

This duality is fully described mathematically by \x[quantum-electrodynamics]{parent}, where the photon is modelled as a quantized excitation of the photon field.

In \x[special-relativity], it is impossible to travel faster than light.

One argument of why, is that if you could travel faster than light, then you could send a message to a point in \x[spacetime] that is \x[spacelike-separated] from the present. But then since the target is spacelike separated, there exists a \x[inertial-frame-of-reference] in which that event happens before the present, which would be hard to make sense of.

Even worse, it would be possible to travel back in time:

{description=Very short whiteboard video by Peter Mosley from the University of Bath, but it's worth it for newbs. Basically describes \x[spontaneous-parametric-down-conversion].

One interesting thing he mentions is that you could get single photons by making your sunglasses thicker and thicker to reduce how many photons pass, but one big downside problem is that then you don't know when the photon is going to come through, that becomes essentially random, and then you can't use this technique if you need two photons at the same time, which is often the case, see also: \x[two-photon-interference-experiment].

= Biconvex spherical lens
{parent=lens}

Focal length

Each side is a sphere section. They don't have to have the same radius, they are still simple to understand with different radiuses.

The two things you have to have in mind that this does are:
* converges \x[parallel-light] to a point at center at distance $f$ known as the \x[focal-length].

  This is for example why you can use lenses to burn things with \x[sun] rays, which are basically parallel.

  Conversely, if the input is a \x[point-light-source] at the \x[focal-length], it gets converted into \x[parallel-light].
* image formation: it converges all rays coming from a given source point to a single point image. This amplifies the signal, and forms an image at a plane.

  The source image can be far away, and the virtual image can be close to the lens. This is exactly what we need for a camera.

  For each distance on one side, it only works for another distance on the other side. So when we set the distance between the lens and the detector, this sets the distance of the source object, i.e. the focus. The equation is:
  $$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_1} + \frac{1}{S_2}$$
  where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the two distances.

https://spie.org/publications/fg05_p03_maluss_law[]:
\Q[At the beginning of the nineteenth century the only known way to generate polarized light was with a calcite crystal. In 1808, using a calcite crystal, Malus discovered that natural incident light became polarized when it was reflected by a glass surface, and that the light reflected close to an angle of incidence of 57° could be extinguished when viewed through the crystal. He then proposed that natural light consisted of the s- and p-polarizations, which were perpendicular to each other.]

{parent=standard-model}

\x[physicist]{c}{p} love to talk about that stuff, but no one ever has the guts to explain it into enough detail to show its beauty!!!

Perhaps the wisest thing is to just focus entirely on the \x[u-1] part to start with, which is the \x[quantum-electrodynamics] one, which is the simplest and most useful and historically first one to come around.

Perhaps the best explanation is that if you assume those \x[internal-symmetry]{p}, then you can systematically make "obvious" educated guesses at the interacting part of the \x[standard-model-lagrangian], which is the fundamental part of the \x[standard-model]. See e.g.:
* \x[derivation-of-the-quantum-electrodynamics-lagrangian]
* \x[physics-from-symmetry-by-jakob-schwichtenberg-2015] chapter 7 "Interaction Theory" derives all three of \x[quantum-electrodynamics], \x[weak-interaction] and \x[quantum-chromodynamics] Lagrangian from each of the symmetries!

One bit underlying reason is: \x[noether-s-theorem].

Notably, https://axelmaas.blogspot.com/2010/08/global-and-local-symmetries.html gives a good overview:
\Q[
A local symmetry transformation is much more complicated to visualize. Take a rectangular grid of the billiard balls from the last post, say ten times ten. Each ball is spherical symmetric, and thus invariant under a rotation. The system now has a global and a local symmetry. A global symmetry transformation would rotate each ball by the same amount in the same direction, leaving the system unchanged. A local symmetry transformation would rotate each ball about a different amount and around a different axis, still leaving the system to the eye unchanged. The system has also an additional global symmetry. Moving the whole grid to the left or to the right leaves the grid unchanged. However, no such local symmetry exists: Moving only one ball will destroy the grid's structure.

Such global and local symmetries play an important role in physics. The global symmetries are found to be associated with properties of particles, e. g., whether they are matter or antimatter, whether they carry electric charge, and so on. Local symmetries are found to be associated with forces. In fact, all the fundamental forces of nature are associated with very special local symmetries. For example, the weak force is actually associated in a very intricate way with local rotations of a four-dimensional sphere. The reason is that, invisible to the eye, everything charged under the weak force can be characterized by a arrow pointing from the center to the surface of such a four-dimensional sphere. This arrow can be rotated in a certain way and at every individual point, without changing anything which can be measured. It is thus a local symmetry. This will become more clearer over time, as at the moment of first encounter this appears to be very strange indeed.
]{id=quote-axelmaas-local-symmetry}
so it seems that that's why they are so key: \x[local-symmetry]{p} map to the forces themselves!!!

https://axelmaas.blogspot.com/2010/09/symmetries-of-standard-model.html then goes over all symmetries of the \x[standard-model] uber quickly, including the global ones.

{c}
{parent=particle-physics}
{wiki}

Unified all previous electro-magnetism theories into one equation.

Explains the propagation of light as a wave, and matches the previously known relationship between the \x[speed-of-light] and electromagnetic constants.

The equations are a limit case of the more complete \x[quantum-electrodynamics], and unlike that more general theory account for the quantization of \x[photon].

The equations are a system of \x[partial-differential-equation].

The system consists of 6 unknown functions that map 4 variables: time t and the x, y and z positions in space, to a real number:
* $E_x(t, x,y,z)$, $E_y(t, x,y,z)$, $E_z(t, x,y,z)$: directions of the electric field $\E : \R^4 \to \R^3$
* $B_x(t, x,y,z)$, $B_y(t, x,y,z)$, $B_z(t, x,y,z)$: directions of the magnetic field $\B : \R^4 \to \R^3$
and two known input functions:
* $\rho : \R^3\ to \R$: density of charges in space
* $\J : \R^3 \to \R^3$: current vector in space. This represents the strength of moving charges in space.

Due to the \x[conservation-of-charge] however, those input functions have the following restriction:
$$
\pdv{\rho}{t} + \div{\mathbf{\J}} = 0
$$
{title=Charge conservation}

Also consider the following cases:
* if a spherical charge is moving, then this of course means that $\rho$ is changing with time, and at the same time that a current exists
* in an \x[ideal] infinite cylindrical wire however, we can have constant $\rho$ in the wire, but there can still be a current because those charges are moving

  Such infinite cylindrical wire is of course an ideal case, but one which is a good approximation to the huge number of electrons that travel in a actual wire.

The goal of finding $\E$ and $\B$ is that those fields allow us to determine the force that gets applied to a charge via the \x[equation-lorentz-force], and then to find the force we just need to integrate over the entire body.

Finally, now that we have defined all terms involved in the Maxwell equations, let's see the equations:

$$
div{\E} = \frac{\rho}{\vacuumPermittivity}
$$
{title=Gauss' law}

$$
div{\B} = 0
$$
{title=Gauss's law for magnetism}

$$

\pdv{E_z}{x} =

As seen from \x[explicit-scalar-form-of-the-maxwell-s-equations], this expands to 8 equations, so the question arises if the system is over-determined because it only has 6 functions to be determined.

As explained on the Wikipedia page  however, this is not the case, because if the first two equations hold for the initial condition, then the othe six equations imply that they also hold for all time, so they can be essentially omitted.

It is also worth noting that the first two equations don't involve time derivatives. Therefore, they can be seen as spacial constraints.

TODO: the \x[electric-field] and \x[magnetic-field] can be expressed in terms of the \x[electric-potential] and \x[magnetic-vector-potential]. So then we only need 4 variables?

Explains how it is possible \x[invariance-of-the-speed-of-light][that everyone observes the same speed of light, even if they are moving towards or opposite to the light]!!!

This was first best observed by the \x[michelson-morley-experiment], which uses the movement of the Earth at different times of the year to try and detect differences in the speed of light.

This leads leads to the following conclusions:
* to \x[length-contraction] and time dilation
* the speed of light is the maximum speed anything can reach

All of this goes of course completely against our daily Physics intuition.

The "special" in the name refers to the fact that it is a superset of \x[general-relativity], which also explains gravity in a single framework.

Since time and space get all messed up together, you have to be very careful to understand what it means to say "I observed this to happen over there at that time", otherwise you will go crazy. A good way to think about is this:
* use \x[einstein-synchronization] to setup a bunch of clocks for every position in your \x[frame-of-reference]
* on every point of space, you put a little detector which records events and the time of the event
* each detector can only detect events locally, i.e. events that happen very close to the detector
* then, after the event, the detectors can send a signal to you, who is sitting at the origin, telling you what they detected

The equation that allows us to calculate stuff in \x[special-relativity]!

Take two observers with identical rules and stopwatch, and aligned axes, but one is on a car moving at towards the $+x$ direction at speed $v$.

TODO image.

When both observe an event, if we denote:
* $(t, x, y, z)$ the observation of the standing observer
* $(t', x', y', z')$ the observation of the ending observer on a car
It is of course arbitrary who is standing and who is moving, we will just use the term "standing" for the one without primes.

Then the coordinates of the event observed by the observer on the car are:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t' & = \gamma \left( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right) \\
x' & = \gamma \left( x - v t \right) \\
y' & = y \\
z' & = z
\end{aligned}
$$
where:
$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}
$$

Note that if $\frac{v}{c}$ tends towards zero, then this reduces to the usual \x[galilean-transformation]{p} which our intuition expects:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t' & = t
x' & = x - v t \\
y' & = y \\
z' & = z
\end{aligned}
$$

This explains why we don't observe special relativity in our daily lives: macroscopic objects move too slowly compared to light, and $\frac{v}{c}$ is almost zero.

Same motivation as \x[galilean-invariance], but \x[relativistic] version of that: we want the laws of physics to have the same form on all inertial frames, so we really want to write them in a way that is Lorentz covariant.

This is just the relativistic version of that which takes the \x[lorentz-transformation] into account instead of just the old \x[galilean-transformation].

{synonym}

Basically a synonym of \x[lorentz-covariance]?

= Lorentz transform consequence: everyone sees the same speed of light
{c}
{parent=lorentz-transformation}

OK, so let's verify the main desired consequence of the \x[lorentz-transformation]: that everyone observes the same \x[speed-of-light].

Observers will measure the speed of light by calculating how long it takes the light going towards $+x$ cross a rod of length $L = x_2 - x_1$ laid in the x axis at position $X1$.

TODO image.

Each observer will observe two events:
* $(t_1, x_1, y_1, z_1)$: the light touches the left side of the rod
* $(t_2, x_2, y_2, z_2)$: the light touches the right side of the rod

Supposing that the standing observer measures the speed of light as $c$ and that light hits the left side of the rod at time $T1$, then he observes the coordinates:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t_1 & = T1 \\
x_1 & = X1 \\
t_2 & = \frac{L}{c} \\
x_2 & = X1 + L \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, if we transform for the moving observer:
$$
\begin{aligned}
t_1' & = \gamma \left( t_1 - \frac{v x_1}{c^2} \right) \\
x_1' & = \gamma \left( x_1 - v t_1             \right) \\
t_2' & = \gamma \left( t_2 - \frac{v x_2}{c^2} \right) \\
x_2' & = \gamma \left( x_2 - v t_2             \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$
and so the moving observer measures the speed of light as:
$$
\begin{aligned}
c' & = \frac{x_2' - x_1'}{t_2' - t_1'} \\
   & = \frac{(x_2 - v t_2) - (x_1 - v t_1)}{(t_2 - \frac{v x_2}{c^2}) - (t_1 - \frac{v x_1}{c^2})} \\
   & = \frac{(x_2 - x_1) - v (t_2 - t_1)}{(t_2 - t_1) - \frac{v}{c^2} (x_2 - x_1)} \\
   & = \frac{\frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1} - v}{1 - \frac{v}{c^2} \frac{x_2 -x_1}{t_2 - t_1}} \\
   & = \frac{c - v}{1 - \frac{v}{c^2} c} \\
   & = \frac{c - v}{\frac{c - v}{c}} \\
   & = c \\
\end{aligned}
$$

= Length contraction
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

Suppose that a rod has is length $L$ measured on a rest frame $S$ (or maybe even better: two identical rulers were manufactured, and one is taken on a spaceship, a bit like the \x[twin-paradox]).

Question: what is the length $L'$ than an observer in frame $S'$ moving relative to $S$ as speed $v$ observe the rod to be?

The key idea is that there are two events to consider in each frame, which we call 1 and 2:
* the left end of the rod is an observation event at a given position at a given time: $x_1$ and $t_1$ for $S$ or $x'_1$ and $t'_1$ for $S'$
* the right end of the rod is an observation event at a given position at a given time : $x_2$ and $t_2$ for $S$ or $x'_2$ and $t'_2$ for $S'$
Note that what you visually observe on a photograph is a different measurement to the more precise/easy to calculate two event measurement. On a photograph, it seems you might not even see the contraction in some cases as mentioned at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotation

Measuring a length means to measure the $x_2 - x_1$ difference for a single point in time in your frame ($t2 = t1$).

So what we want to obtain is $x'_2 - x'_1$ for any given time $t'2 = t'1$.

In summary, we have:
$$
\begin{aligned}
L  &= x_2  &- x_1 \\
L' &= x'_2 &- x'_1
t'_2 = t'_1
\end{aligned}
$$

By plugging those values into the \x[lorentz-transformation], we can eliminate $t_2 and t_1$, and conclude that for any $t'_2 = t'_1$, the length contraction relation holds:
$$
L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}
$$

The key question that needs intuitive clarification then is: but how can this be symmetric? How can both observers see each other's rulers shrink?

And the key answer is: because to the second observer, the measurements made by the first observer are not simultaneous. Notably, the two measurement events are obviously \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p} by looking at the \x[light-cone], and therefore can be measured even in different orders by different observers.

What you would see the moving rod look like on a photo of a \x[length-contraction] experiment, as opposed as using two locally measured separate spacetime events to measure its length.

= Time dilation
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

One of the best ways to think about it is the \x[transversal-time-dilation] thought experiment.

= Transversal time dilation
{parent=time-dilation}
{wiki=Time_dilation#Simple_inference_of_velocity_time_dilation}

Light watch transverse to direction of motion. This case is interesting because it separates \x[length-contraction] from \x[time-dilation] completely.

Of course, as usual in \x[special-relativity], calling something "time dilation" leads us to \x[mind-boggling] ideas of "symmetry breaking": if both frames have a light watch, how can both possibly observe the other to be time dilated?

And the answer to this, is the usual: in special relativity time and space are interwoven in a \x[fucked] up way, everything is just a spacetime event.

In this case, there are three spacetime events of interest: both clocks start at same position, your beam hits up at x=0, moving frame hits up at x>0.

Those two mentioned events are \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p}, and therefore even though they seem simultaneous to you, they are not going to be simultaneous to the moving observer!

If \x[einstein-synchronization][little clock one meter away from you] tells you that at the time of some event (your light beam hit up) the moving light watch was only 50% up, this is just a number given by your one meter away watch!

= Transverse Doppler effect
{parent=time-dilation}
{wiki=Relativistic_Doppler_effect#Transverse_Doppler_effect}

= Twin paradox
{parent=lorentz-transformation}
{wiki}

The key question is: why is this not symmetrical?

One answer is: because one of the twin accelerates, and therefore changes inertial frames.

But the better answer is: understand what happens when the stationary twin sends light signals at constant time intervals to each other. When does the travelling twin receives them?

By doing that, we see that "all the extra aging happens immediately when the twin turns around":
* on the out trip, both twins receive signals at constant intervals
* when the moving twin turns around and starts to accelerate through different inertial frames, shit happens:
  * the moving twin suddenly notices that the rate of signals from the stationary twin increased. They are getting older faster than us!
  * the stationary twin suddenly notices that the rate of signals from the moving twin decreased. They are getting older slower than us!
* then when the moving twin reaches the return velocity, both see constant signal rates once again

\Image[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/TwinParadoxProperAcceleration.svg]
{title=\x[twin-paradox]{c} illustration with twins sending light signals at regular intervals.}
{height=600}

Another way of understanding it is: you have to make all calculations on a \i[single] inertial frame for the entire trip.

Supposing the sibling quickly accelerates out (or magically starts moving at constant speed), travels at constant speed, and quickly accelerates back, and travels at constant speed setup, there are three frames that seem reasonable:
* the frame of the non-accelerating sibling
* the outgoing trip of the accelerating sibling
* the return trip of the accelerating sibling

If you do that, all three calculations give the exact same result, which is reassuring.

Another way to understand it is to do explicit integrations of the acceleration: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/242043/what-is-the-proper-way-to-explain-the-twin-paradox/242044#242044 This is the least insightful however :-)

This is a well known though experiment, which \x[richard-feynman] used to emphasize
* infinite wire with balanced positive and negative charges, so no net charge, but a net magnetic field
* a single charge moves parallel to wire at the same speed as the electrons

In the above experiment:
* from the wire frame, the charge feels electromagnetic force, because it is moving and there is a magnetic field
* from the single charge frame, there is still magnetic field (positive charges are moving), but the body itself is not moving, so there is no force!

The solution to this problem is \x[length-contraction]: the positive charges are length contracted and the moving electrons aren't, and therefore they are denser and therefore there is an effective charge from that frame.

= Minkowski space
{c}
{parent=spacetime}
{wiki}

\x[r-4] with a weird \x[dot-product]-like operation called the \x[minkowski-inner-product].

Because the \x[minkowski-inner-product] product is not \x[positive-definite], the \x[norm-induced-by-an-inner-product] is a \x[norm], and the space is not a \x[metric-space] strictly speaking.

The name given to this type of space is a \x[pseudometric-space].

= Minkowski inner product
{c}
{parent=minkowski-space}
{tag=form-mathematics}

This \x[form-mathematics] is not really an \x[inner-product] in the common modern definition, because it is not \x[positive-definite], only a \x[symmetric-bilinear-form].

= Minkowski inner product matrix
{c}
{parent=minkowski-inner-product}
{title2=$\eta_{\mu\nu}$}

The \x[matrix-representation-of-the-symmetric-bilinear-form] that is the \x[minkowski-inner-product].

Since that is a \x[symmetric-bilinear-form], the associated \x[matrix] is a \x[symmetric-matrix].

By default, we will use the time negative representation unless stated otherwise:
$$
\eta_{\mu\nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
but another equivalent one is to use a time positive representation:
$$
\eta_{\mu\nu} =
\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &  0 &  0 &  0 \\
 0 & -1 &  0 &  0 \\
 0 &  0 & -1 &  0 \\
 0 &  0 &  0 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
The matrix is typically denoted by the \x[eta][Greek letter eta].

Why should I care when I can calculate new x and new time with \x[lorentz-transformation]?

Answer: it can give some qualitative intuition on what is larger/smaller happens before/after based only on arguably more intuitive geometric considerations, without requiring you to do any calculations, see e.g. \x[image-spacetime-diagram-illustrating-how-faster-than-light-travel-implies-time-travel].

= Light cone
{parent=spacetime-diagram}
{wiki}

A subset of \x[spacetime-diagram].

The key insights that it gives are:
* future and past are well defined: every reference frame sees your future in your future cone, and your past in your past cone

  Otherwise causality could be violated, and then things would go really bad, you could tell your past self to tell your past self to tell your past self to do something.

  You can only affect the outcome of events in your future cone, and you can only be affected by events in your past cone. You can't travel fast enough to affect.

  Two spacetime events with such fixed causality are called \x[timelike-separated-event]{p}.
* every other event (to right and left, known as \x[spacelike-separated-event]{p}) can be measured to happen before or after your current spacetime event by different observers.

  But that does not violate causality, because you just can't reach those spacetime points anyways to affect them.

On the \x[light-cone], these are events on the left/right part of the cone.

In the \x[galilean-transformation], there are two separate invariants that two \x[inertial-frame-of-reference] always agree on between two separate events:
* \x[time]
* \x[length], given by the \x[pythagorean-theorem]

However, in \x[special-relativity], neither of those are invariant separately, since space and time are mixed up together.

Instead, there is a new unified invariant: the spacetime-interval, given by:
$$c \Delta t^2 - (\Delta x ^2 + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2)$$

Note that this distance can be zero for two events separated.

\x[ciro-santilli] finds it interesting that radioactive decay basically kickstarted the domain of \x[nuclear-physics] by essentially providing a natural \x[particle-accelerator] from a chunk of radioactive element.

The discovery process was particularly interesting, including \x[henri-becquerel]'s luck while observing \x[phosphorescence], and \x[marie-curie]'s observation that the \x[uranium] \x[ore] were more radioactive than pure uranium, and must therefore contain other even more radioactive substances, which lead to the discovery of \x[polonium] (\x[half-life] 138 days) and \x[radium] (half-life 1600 years).

= Alpha decay
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

Most of the \x[helium] in the Earth's atmosphere comes from alpha decay, since helium is lighter than air and naturally escapes out out of the atmosphere.

Wiki mentions that alpha decay is well modelled as a \x[quantum-tunnelling] event, see also \x[geiger-nuttall-law].

As a result of that law, alpha particles have relatively little energy variation around 5 MeV or a speed of about 5% of the \x[speed-of-light] for any element, because the energy is inversely exponentially proportional to \x[half-life]. This is because:
* if the energy is much larger, decay is very fast and we don't have time to study the \x[isotope]
* if the energy is much smaller, decay is very rare and we don't have enough events to observe at all

\x[uranium]{c} emits them, you can see their mass to charge ratio under magnetic field and so deduce that they are \x[electron]{p}.

Caused by \x[weak-interaction] TODO why/how.

The emitted electron kinetic energy is random from zero to a maximum value. The rest goes into a \x[neutrino]. This is how the neutrino was first discovered/observed indirectly. This is well illustrated in a \x[decay-scheme] such as \x[image-caesium-137-decay-scheme].

= Gamma ray
{parent=radioactive-decay}
{wiki}

Most commonly known as a byproduct \x[radioactive-decay].

A \x[decay-scheme] such as \x[image-caesium-137-decay-scheme] illustrates well how gamma radiation happens as a byproduct of \x[radioactive-decay] due to the existence of \x[nuclear-isomer].

Gamma rays are pretty cool as they give us insight into the energy levels/different configurations of the nucleus.

They have also been used as early sources of high energy particles for \x[particle-physics] experiments before the development of \x[particle-accelerator]{p}, serving a similar purpose to \x[cosmic-ray]{p} in those early days.

But \x[gamma-ray]{p} they were more convenient in some cases because you could more easily manage them inside a \x[laboratory] rather than have to go climb some bloody mountain or a \x[balloon].

The \x[positron] for example was first observed on \x[cosmic-ray]{p}, but better confirmed in \x[gamma-ray] experiments by \x[carl-david-anderson].

The \x[half-life] of \x[radioactive-decay], which as discovered a few years before \x[quantum-mechanics] was discovered and matured, was a major mystery. Why do some nuclei fission in apparently random fashion, while others don't? How is the state of different nuclei different from one another? This is mentioned in \x[inward-bound-by-abraham-pais-1988] Chapter 6.e Why a half-life?

The term also sees use in other areas, notably \x[biology], where e.g. \x[rna]{p} spontaneously decay as part of the \x[cell]'s \x[control-system], see e.g. mentions in \x[e-coli-whole-cell-model-by-covert-lab].

\x[quantum-field-theory-lecture-notes-by-david-tong-2007] puts it well:
\Q[
In classical physics, the primary reason for introducing the concept of the \x[field-physics] is to construct laws of Nature that are local. The old laws of Coulomb and Newton involve "action at a distance". This means that the force felt by an electron (or planet) changes immediately if a distant \x[proton] (or star) moves. This situation is philosophically unsatisfactory. More importantly, it is also experimentally wrong. The field theories of Maxwell and Einstein remedy the situation, with all interactions mediated in a local fashion by the field.

As of 2020, this is the other "fundamental branch of physics" besides to \x[particle-physics]/\x[nuclear-physics].

Condensed matter is basically \x[chemistry] but without reactions: you study a fixed state of matter, not a reaction in which compositions change with time.

Just like in chemistry, you end up getting some very well defined substance properties due to the incredibly large number of atoms.

Just like chemistry, the ultimate goal is to do de-novo \x[computational-chemistry] to predict those properties.

And just like chemistry, what we can actually is actually very limited in part due to the exponential nature of \x[quantum-mechanics].

Also since chemistry involves reactions, chemistry puts a huge focus on liquids and solutions, which is the simplest state of matter to do reactions in.

Condensed matter however can put a lot more emphasis on solids than chemistry, notably because solids are what we generally want in end products, no one likes stuff leaking right?

But it also studies liquids, e.g. notably \x[superfluidity].

One thing condensed matter is particularly obsessed with is the fascinating phenomena of \x[phase-transition].

{parent=statistical-physics}

A good conceptual starting point is to like the example that is mentioned at \x[the-harvest-of-a-century-by-siegmund-brandt-2008].

Consider a system with 2 particles and 3 states. Remember that:
* in \x[quantum-statistics] (\x[bose-einstein-statistics] and \x[fermi-dirac-statistics]), particles are indistinguishable, therefore, we might was well call both of them `A`, as opposed to `A` and `B` from non-quantum statistics
* in \x[bose-einstein-statistics], two particles may occupy the same state. In \x[fermi-dirac-statistics]

Therefore, all the possible way to put those two particles in three states are for:
* \x[maxwell-boltzmann-distribution]: both A and B can go anywhere:
  \Table[
  || State 1
  || State 2
  || State 3

  |

  | A
  ]
* \x[bose-einstein-statistics]: because A and B are indistinguishable, there is now only 1 possibility for the states where A and B would be in different states.

  || State 1
  || State 2
  || State 3

  |

  | A
  |

  |

  ]

Both \x[bose-einstein-statistics] and \x[fermi-dirac-statistics] tend to the \x[maxwell-boltzmann-distribution] in the limit of either:
* high \x[temperature]
* low concentrations

Adds up chemical energy and kinetic energy.

Wikipedia mentions however that the kinetic energy is often negligible, even for gases.

The sum is of interest when thinking about reactions because chemical reactions can change the number of molecules involved, and therefore the pressure.

To predict if a reaction is spontaneous or not, negative enthalpy is not enough, we must also consider \x[entropy] via \x[gibbs-free-energy].

TODO understand more intuitively how that determines if a reaction happens or not.

$$\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S$$

At least from the formula we see that:
* the more exothermic, the more likely it is to occur
* if the entropy increases, the higher the temperature, the more likely it is to occur
  * otherwise, the lower the temperature the more likely it is to occur

A prototypical example of reaction that is exothermic but does not happen at any temperature is combustion.

\x[subtle-is-the-lord-by-abraham-pais-1982] chapter 4 "Entropy and Probability" mentions well how \x[boltzmann] first thought that the second law was an actual base physical law of the universe while he was calculating numerical stuff for it, including as late as 1872.

But then he saw an argument by \x[johann-joseph-loschmidt] that given the \x[time-reversibility-of-classical-mechanics], and because they were thinking of atoms as classical balls as in the \x[kinetic-theory-of-gases], then there always exist a valid physical state where entropy decreases, by just reversing the direction of time and all particle speeds.

So from this he understood that the second law can only be probabilistic, and not a fundamental law of physics, which he published clearly in 1877.

{c}
{parent=mechanics}
{wiki}

Originally it was likely created to study constrained mechanical systems where you want to use some "custom convenient" variables to parametrize things instead of global x, y, z. Classical examples that you must have in mind include:
* \x[compound-atwood-machine]. Here, we can use the coordinates as the heights of masses relative to the \x[axle]{p} rather than absolute heights relative to the ground
* \x[double-pendulum], using two angles. The Lagrangian approach is simpler than using Newton's laws
  * \x[pendulum], use angle instead of x/y
* \x[two-body-problem], use the distance between the bodies
\x[lagrangian-mechanics-lectures-by-michel-van-biezen-2017] is a good starting point.

When doing lagrangian mechanics, we just lump together all generalized coordinates into a single vector $\va{q}(t) : \R \to \R^n$ that maps time to the full state:
$$
\va{q}(t) = [q_1(t), q_2(t), q_3(t), ..., q_n(t)]
$$
where each component can be anything, either the x/y/z coordinates relative to the ground of different particles, or angles, or nay other crazy thing we want.

The \x[lagrangian] is a function $\R^n \times \R^n \times \R \to \R$ that maps:
$$
L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)
$$
to a real number.

Then, the \x[stationary-action-principle] says that the actual path taken obeys the \x[euler-lagrange-equation]:
$$
\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{q_i} - \dv{}{t}\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{\dot{q_i}} = 0
$$
This produces a \x[system-of-partial-differential-equations] with:
* $n$ equations
* $n$ unknown functions $q_i$
* at most second order derivatives of $q_i$. Those appear because of the chain rule on the second term.

The mixture of so many derivatives is a bit mind mending, so we can clarify them a bit further. At:
$$
\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{q_i}
$$
the $q_i$ is just identifying which argument of the Lagrangian we are differentiating by: the i-th according to the order of our definition of the Lagrangian. It is not the actual function, just a mnemonic.

Then at:
$$
\dv{}{t}\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{\dot{q_i}}
$$
* the $\pdv{}{\dot{q_i}}$ part is just like the previous term, $\dot{q_i}$ just identifies the argument with index $n + i$ ($n$ because we have the $n$ non derivative arguments)
* after the partial derivative is taken and returns a new function $\pdv{L(\va{q}(t), \dot{\va{q}}(t), t)}{\dot{q_i}}$, then the \x[multivariable-chain-rule] comes in and expands everything into $2n + 1$ terms

However, people later noticed that the Lagrangian had some nice properties related to \x[lie-group] continuous symmetries.

Basically it seems that the easiest way to come up with new \x[quantum-field-theory] models is to first find the Lagrangian, and then derive the equations of motion from them.

For every \x[continuous-symmetry] in the system (modelled by a \x[lie-group]), there is a corresponding conservation law: \x[local-symmetries-of-the-lagrangian-imply-conserved-currents].
\x[genius-richard-feynman-and-modern-physics-by-james-gleick-1994] chapter "The Best Path" mentions that \x[richard-feynman] didn't like the \x[lagrangian-mechanics] approach when he started university at \x[mit], because he felt it was too magical. The reason is that the Lagrangian approach basically starts from the principle that "nature minimizes the action across time globally". This implies that things that will happen in the future are also taken into consideration when deciding what has to happen before them! Much like the lifeguard in the \x[lifegard-problem] making global decisions about the future. However, chapter "Least Action in Quantum Mechanics" comments that Feynman later notice that this was indeed necessary while developping \x[wheeler-feynman-absorber-theory] into \x[quantum-electrodynamics], because they felt that it would make more sense to consider things that way while playing with ideas such as \x[positrons-are-electrons-travelling-back-in-time]. This is in contrast with \x[hamiltonian-mechanics], where the idea of time moving foward is more directly present, e.g. as in the \x[schrodinger-equation].

Furthermore, given the symmetry, we can calculate the derived conservation law, and vice versa.

And partly due to the above observations, it was noticed that the easiest way to describe the fundamental laws of \x[particle-physics] and make calculations with them is to first formulate their Lagrangian somehow: \x[why-do-symmetries-such-as-su-3-su-2-and-u-1-matter-in-particle-physics].

As mentioned on the \x[wikipedia] page https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stationary_Action_Principle&oldid=1020413171[], "principle of least action" is not accurate since it could not necessarily be a minima, we could just be in a \x[maxima-and-minima][saddle-point].

{parent=stationary-action-principle}
{tag=maxima-and-minima}

Calculus of variations is the field that searches for \x[maxima-and-minima] of \x[functional]{p}, rather than the more elementary case of functions from $\R$ to $\R$.

= Functional
{c}
{parent=calculus-of-variations}
{wiki=Euler–Lagrange equation}

A \x[function] that takes input function and outputs a \x[real-number].

= Euler-Lagrange equation
{c}
{parent=calculus-of-variations}
{wiki=Euler–Lagrange equation}

Let's start with the one dimensional case. Let the $q : \R \to \R$ and a \x[functional] $I$ defined by a function of three variables $F : \R^3 \to \R$:
$$I(q) = \int_{t_0}^{t} F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)) dt$$

Then, the \x[euler-lagrange-equation] gives the \x[maxima-and-minima] of the that type of functional. Note that this type of functional is just one very specific type of functional amongst all possible functionals that one might come up with. However, it turns out to be enough to do most of physics, so we are happy with with it.

Given $F$, the Euler-Lagrange equations are a system of \x[ordinary-differential-equation]{p} constructed from that $F$ such that the solutions to that system are the maxima/minima.

In the one dimensional case, the system has a single ordinary differential equation:
$$
\pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{q} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{\dot{q}} = 0
$$

By $\pdv{F}{q}$ and $\pdv{F}{\dot{q}}$ we simply mean "the \x[partial-derivative] of $F$ with respect to its second and third arguments". The notation is a bit confusing at first, but that's all it means.

Therefore, that expression ends up being at most a \x[order-of-a-differential-equation][second order] \x[ordinary-differential-equation] where $q$ is the unknown, since:
* the term $\pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{q}$ is a function of $t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)$
* the term $\pdv{F(t, q(t), \dot{q}(t))}{\dot{q}}$ is a function of $t, q(t), \dot{q}(t)$. And so it's derivative with respect to time will contain only up to $\ddot{q}$

Now let's think about the multi-dimensional case. Instead of having $q : \R \to \R$, we now have $q : \R \to \R^n$. Think about the \x[lagrangian-mechanics] motivation of a \x[double-pendulum] where for a given time we have two angles.

Let's do the 2-dimensional case then. In that case, $F$ is going to be a function of 5 variables $F : \R^5 \to \R$ rather than 3 as in the one dimensional case, and the functional looks like:
$$I(q) = \int_{t_0}^{t} F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2})(t) dt$$

This time, the Euler-Lagrange equations are going to be a system of two \x[ordinary-differential-equation]{p} on two unknown functions $q_1$ and $q_2$ of order up to 2 in both variables:
$$
\pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t))}{q_1} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t)}{\dot{q_1}} = 0 \\
\pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t))}{q_2} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, q_1(t), q_2(t), \dot{q_1}(t), \dot{q_2}(t)}{\dot{q_2}} = 0 \\
$$
At this point, notation is getting a bit clunky, so people will often condense the $q_i$ vector
$$
\pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{q_1} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{\dot{q_1}} = 0 \\
\pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{q_2} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F(t, \mathbf{q}(t), \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t))}{\dot{q_2}} = 0 \\
$$
or just omit the arguments of $F$ entirely:
$$
\pdv{F}{q_i} - \dv{}{t} \pdv{F}{\dot{q_i}} = 0
$$

{wiki}

Basically: \x[why-do-symmetries-such-as-su-3-su-2-and-u-1-matter-in-particle-physics].

= Lagrangian density
{parent=lagrangian-field-theory}

When we particles particles, the \x[action-physics] is obtained by integrating the \x[lagrangian] over time:
$$
Action = \int_{t_0}^{t} L(x(t), \pdv{x(t)}{t}, t) dt
$$

In the case of \x[field-mathematics]{p} however, we can expand the Lagrangian out further, to also integrate over the space coordinates and their derivatives.

Since we are now working with something that gets integrated over space to obtain the total action, much like \x[density] would be integrated over space to obtain a total mass, the name "Lagrangian density" is fitting.

E.g. for a 2-dimensional field $f(x, y, t)$:
$$
Action = \int_{t_0}^{t} L(f(x, y, t), \pdv{f(x, y, t)}{x}, \pdv{f(x, y, t)}{y}, \pdv{f(x, y, t)}{t}, x, y, t) dx dy dt
$$

Of course, if we were to write it like that all the time we would go mad, so we can just write a much more condensed \x[vectorized] version using the \x[gradient] with $x \in \R^2$:
$$
Action = \int_{t_0}^{t} L(f(x, t), \grad{f(x, t)}, x, t) dx dt
$$

And in the context of \x[special-relativity], people condense that even further by adding $t$ to the spacetime \x[four-vector] as well, so you don't even need to write that separate pesky $t$.

The main point of talking about the Lagrangian density instead of a Lagrangian for fields is likely that it treats space and time in a more uniform way, which is a basic requirement of \x[special-relativity]: we have to be able to mix them up somehow to do \x[lorentz-transformation]{p}. Notably, this is a key ingredient in a/the formulation of \x[quantum-field-theory].

= Generalized coordinate
{parent=lagrangian}
{wiki}

The variables of the \x[lagrangian], e.g. the angles of a \x[double-pendulum]. From that example it is clear that these variables don't need to be simple things like \x[cartesian-coordinate]{p} or \x[polar-coordinate]{p} (although these tend to be the overwhelming majority of simple case encountered): any way to describe the system is perfectly valid.

In \x[quantum-field-theory], those variables are actually fields.

= Noether's theorem
{c}
{parent=lagrangian-mechanics}

For every \x[continuous-symmetry] in the system (\x[lie-group]), there is a corresponding conservation law.

Furthermore, given the symmetry, we can calculate the derived conservation law, and vice versa.

As mentioned at http://buzzard.ups.edu/courses/2017spring/projects/schumann-lie-group-ups-434-2017.pdf[], what the symmetry (\x[lie-group]) acts on (obviously?!) are the \x[lagrangian] \x[generalized-coordinate]{p}. And from that, we immediately guess that manifolds are going to be important, because the generalized variables of the Lagrangian can trivially be \x[non-euclidean-geometry], e.g. the \x[pendulum] lives on an infinite cylinder.

The key difference from \x[lagrangian-mechanics] is that the Hamiltonian approach groups variables into pairs of coordinates called the \x[phase-space-coordinate]{p}:
* generalized coordinates, generally positions or angles
* their corresponding conjugate momenta, generally velocities, or angular velocities
This leads to having two times more unknown functions than in the Lagrangian. However, it also leads to a \x[system-of-partial-differential-equations] with only first order derivatives, which is nicer. Notably, it can be more clearly seen in \x[phase-space].

Analogous to what the \x[euler-lagrange-equation] is to \x[lagrangian-mechanics], Hamilton's equations give the \x[equations-of-motion] from a given input \x[hamiltonian]:
$$
\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_j} = -\dot{p}_j \\
\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_j} =  \dot{q}_j

Ah, the jewel of \x[computational-physics].

Also known as an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods[ab initio] method: no experimental measurement is taken as input, \x[quantum-electrodynamics][QED is all you need].

But since QED is thought to fully describe all relevant aspects \x[molecule]{p}, it could be called "the" ab initio method.

For one, if we were able to predict protein molecule interactions, our understanding of \x[molecular-biology-technologies] would be solved.

No more ultra expensive and complicated \x[x-ray-crystallography] or \x[cryogenic-electron-microscopy].

And the fact that \x[quantum-computer]{p} are one of the most promising advances to this field, is also very very exciting: \x[quantum-algorithm]{full}.

This is where \x[isidor-rabi] exposed experiments carried out on the \x[anomalous-magnetic-dipole-moment] and \x[willis-lamb] presented his work on the \x[lamb-shift].

It was a very private and intimate conference, that gathered the best physicists of the area, one is reminded of the style of the \x[solvay-conference].

\x[qed-and-the-men-who-made-it-dyson-feynman-schwinger-and-tomonaga-by-silvan-schweber-1994] chapter 4.1 this conference was soon compared to the \x[first-solvay-conference-1911], which set in motion the development of \x[non-relativistic-quantum-mechanics].

Followup to the \x[shelter-island-conference], this is where \x[julian-schwinger] and \x[richard-feynman] exposed their theories to explain the experiments of the previous conference.

Julian made a formal presentation that took until the afternoon and bored everyone to death, though the mathematics avoided much questioning.

Feynman then presented his revolutionary approach, which he was unable to prove basic properties of, but which gave correct results, and people were not very happy.

A charismatic, perfect-\x[english-language]-accent (\x[received-pronunciation]) \x[physicist] from \x[university-of-cambridge], specializing in \x[quantum-field-theory].

He has done several "\x[vulgarization]" lectures, some of which could be better called undergrad appetizers rather, a notable example being \x[video-quantum-fields-the-real-building-blocks-of-the-universe-by-david-tong-2017] for the prestigious \x[royal-institution], but remains a hardcore researcher: https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=felFiY4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate[]. Lots of \x[open-access] publications BTW, so \x[kudos].

The amount of lecture notes on his website looks really impressive: http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html[], he looks like a good educator.

David has also shown some interest in applications of high energy mathematical ideas to \x[condensed-matter], e.g. links between the \x[renormalization-group] and \x[phase-transition] phenomena. TODO there was a YouTube video about that, find it and link here.

\x[ciro-santilli] \x[physics-gossip][wonders] if his family is of \x[east-asian], origin and if he can still speak any east asian languages. "Tong" is of course a transcription of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_(surname)[several major Chinese surnames] and from looks he could be mixed blood, but as mentioned at https://www.ancestry.co.uk/name-origin?surname=tong it can also be an English "metonymic occupational name for a maker or user of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongs[tongs]".

\x[ciro-santilli]'s admiration for Dyson goes beyond his "unify all the things approach", which \x[high-flying-bird-vs-gophers][Ciro loves], but also extends to the way he talks and the things he says. Dyson is one of Ciro's favorite physicist.

Besides this, he was also very \x[idealistic] compassionate, and supported a peaceful resolution until \x[world-war-ii] with \x[united-kingdom] was basically ineviatble. Note that this was a strategic mistake.

Dyson is "hawk nosed" as mentioned in \x[genius-richard-feynman-and-modern-physics-by-james-gleick-1994] chapter "Dyson". But he wasn't when he was young, see e.g. https://i2.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/freemandyson_child-1.jpg?resize=768%2C1064&ssl=1 It sems that his nose just never stopped growing after puberty.

He also has some fun stories, like him practicing \x[night-climbing] while at \x[cambridge-university], and having walked from \x[cambridge] to \x[london] (~86km!) in a day with his wheelchair bound friend.

\x[ciro-santilli] feels that the label \x[child-prodigy] applies even more so to him than to \x[feynman] and \x[julian-schwinger].

Head of the theoretical division at the \x[los-alamos-laboratory] during the \x[manhattan-project].

He was also the person under which \x[freeman-dyson] was originally under when he moved from the \x[united-kingdom] to the \x[united-states].

And Hans also impressed Feynman, both were problem solvers, and liked solving mental arithmetic and \x[numerical-analysis].

This relationship is what brought Feynman to \x[cornell-university] after \x[world-war-ii], Hans' institution, which is where Feynman did the main part of his \x[1965-nobel-prize-in-physics-laureate][Nobel prize winning] work on \x[quantum-electrodynamics].

Extremely precocious, borderline \x[child-prodigy], he was reading \x[dirac] at 13-14 from the library.

He started working at night and sleeping during the moring/early afternoon while he was at university.

He was the type of guy that was so good that he didn't really have to follow the university rules very much. He would get into trouble for not following some stupid requirement, but he was so good that they would just let him get away with it.

Besides \x[quantum-electrodynamics], Julian worked on \x[radar] at the \x[rad-lab] during \x[world-war-ii], unlike most other top \x[physicist]{p} who went to \x[los-alamos-laboratory] to work on the \x[atomic-bomb], and he made important contributions there on calculating the best shape of the parts and so on.

He was known for being very formal mathematically and sometimes hard to understand, in stark contrast to \x[feynman] which was much more lose and understandable, especially after \x[freeman-dyson] translated him to the masses.

However, \x[qed-and-the-men-who-made-it-dyson-feynman-schwinger-and-tomonaga-by-silvan-schweber-1994] does emphacise that he was actually also very practical in the sense that he always aimed to obtain definite numbers out of his calculations, and that was not only the case for the \x[lamb-shift].

Maybe this obsession is partly due to his name which no \x[english-language] speaking person knows how to pronounce from the writing.

Eccentric nerdy slow speaking \x[physicist] mostly based in \x[university-of-cambridge].

Created the \x[dirac-equation], what else do you need to know?!

\x[qed-and-the-men-who-made-it-dyson-feynman-schwinger-and-tomonaga-by-silvan-schweber-1994] chapter 1.3 "P.A.M. Dirac and the Birth of Quantum Electrodynamics" quotes Dirac saying how being at high school during \x[world-war-i] was an advantage, since all slightly older boys were being sent to war, and so the younger kids were made advance as fast as they could through subjects. Exactly the type of thing \x[ciro-santilli] wants to achieve with \x[ourbigbook-com], but without the need for a world war hopefully.

Dirac was a staunch \x[atheist] having said during the \x[fifth-solvay-conference-1927]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvay_Conference{ref}:
\Q[If we are honest - and scientists have to be - we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards - in heaven if not on earth - all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.]

While learning black-hole stuff is not on top of \x[ciro-santilli]'s priorities, Hawking's spirit is to be admired.

To never give up even when everything seems lost, and still have a sense of humour is respectable.

An ex-physicist colleague who had met Hawking told an anecdote. Hawking was around in the department one day, they said hi and all. But then Hawking wanted to tell a joke. It took like 5 minutes of typing, and you can imagine that things were pretty awkward and the joke's timing was "a bit off". But Hawking did tell the joke nonetheless.

This is also suggested in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Everything_(2014_film)[The Theory of Everything (2014)] film, and therefore likely the biographies.

= Physics and the illusion of life
{parent=philosophy-of-science}
{tag=cirism}
{tag=essays-by-ciro-santilli}

The natural sciences are not just a tool to predict the future.

They are a reminder that the lives that we live daily are mere illusions, just like \x[buddhist]{p} and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)[Hinduists] say.

We as individuals perceive nothing about the materials that we touch every day really work, nor more importantly how our \x[brain] and \x[cell-biology]{p} work.

Everything is magic out of our control.

The natural sciences allow us peek, with huge concentrated effort, into tiny little bits a little of those unknowns, and blow our minds as we notice that we don't know anything.

For all practical purposes in life, there is a huge macro micro gap. We are only able to directly perceive and influence the macro events. And through those we try to affect micro events. Because for good or bad, micro events reflect in the macro world.

Every one or two weeks \x[ciro-santilli] remembers that he and everything he touches are just a bunch of atoms, and that is an amazing feeling.

Perhaps, the feeling of \x[physics-and-the-illusion-of-life] reaches its peak in \x[molecular-biology].

Just look at your \x[fucking] hand right now.

Do you have any idea of each of the cells in it work? Isn't is at least 100 times more complex than the materials of the table you hand is currently resting on?

It is as if we live in a different plane of existence above molecules, and below galaxies. The hierarchy of \x[image-xkcd-435-fields-arranged-by-purity] puts that nicely into perspective, shame it only starts at the economical level, not going up to \x[astronomy].

The great beauty of science is that it allows us to puncture through some of the layers of reality, either up or down, away from our daily experience.

And the great beauty of \x[artificial-intelligence] research is that it allows to peer deeper into exactly our layer of existence.

This is the non-science fiction version of the \x[lotus-eater-machine].

\x[alan-watts]'s \x[video-alan-watts-philosopher-talk]["Philosopher" talk] mentions related ideas:
\Q[The origin of a person who is defined as a philosopher, is one who finds that existence itself is exceedingly odd.]

The toddler of a friend of \x[ciro-santilli-s-wife] asked her mum:
\Q[Why doesn't my tiger doll close its eyes when we sleep?]
Our perception of the macroscopic world is so magic that children have to learn the difference between living and non-living things.

Goes along: if you could control your life multiple times to be perfect, you would eventually get tired of paradise, and you would go further and further into creating uncertain worlds with some suffering, until you would reach the current real world.

Very similar to \x[the-matrix-1999] when Agent Smith talks about the failed https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Paradise_Matrix[Paradise Matrix] shown at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qs3GlNZMhY[]:
\Q[Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered, where everyone would be happy? It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed that we lacked the programming language to describe your "perfect world". But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through misery and suffering. So the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.]
