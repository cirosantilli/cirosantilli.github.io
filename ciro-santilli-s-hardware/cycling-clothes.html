Buying <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00OISFUQ4">www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00OISFUQ4</a>. Their marketing is very confusing and there are several different names for the product, but the label reads "extremities insulated waterpoof sticky power liner glove", black, large. This is the official page: <a href="https://www.terra-nova.co.uk/products/insulated-waterproof-sticky-power-liner-gloves">www.terra-nova.co.uk/products/insulated-waterproof-sticky-power-liner-gloves</a> X-Dry Stretch, 100% polyester.</div><div class="p" id="_281">2024-10: going to try Endura Men's Strike Glove - Hi-Viz Yellow, Large <a href="https://www.endurasport.com/strike-glove-hi-viz-yellow/12929542.html">www.endurasport.com/strike-glove-hi-viz-yellow/12929542.html</a> | <a href="https://www.wiggle.com/endura-strike-gloves-930526#colcode=93052613">www.wiggle.com/endura-strike-gloves-930526#colcode=93052613</a>. These gloves are high quality, but they are too hot and fleecy for the UK, unless it is an exceptionally cold winter day around 0. This means that they get quite wet from sweat, and they are not that breathable. Also they are very hard to take off and put on, which is painful if you are like me who uses your cell phone for navigation, and while it works with touchscreens, sometimes it's just too annoying and you have to take them off.</div><div class="p" id="_282">2024-05: going to try <a href="https://www.sealskinz.com/products/water-repellent-all-weather-glove">www.sealskinz.com/products/water-repellent-all-weather-glove</a> Sealskinz Tasburgh Water Repellent All Weather love black large because Extremities XDRY has a hole on right thumb due to gear shifting. This glove is very similar to the Nike academy hyperwam, not really a winter glove feels like. Weird branding...</div><div class="p" id="_283">2023-11: Endura Windchill Bibtights XL - Black:  <a href="https://www.endurasport.com/windchill-bibtights-black/12926004.html">www.endurasport.com/windchill-bibtights-black/12926004.html</a> because knees of dhb one open. I'm an idiot for getting XL... it's just that L felt too short on the top. But ultimately XL was too baggy, this became quite apparent on first usage, L would likely have been better, just would have needed to pull it a bit more. Quality is very good, very water repellent, kept me warm on 2C under very light rain. Also tried <a href="https://www.endurasport.com/xtract-bibtight-black/12926142.html">www.endurasport.com/xtract-bibtight-black/12926142.html</a> but the sizing was completely different. L on that one as obviously too large, M felt correct.</div><div class="p" id="_284">2023-07: lost my waterproof cap, not cycling specialized, but was useful. Was by itself in crappy backpocket of cheap muddy fox jersey, lots of wind, some fence jumping... Hadn't noted know the brand/model... sad.

To prevent crap from falling again hopefully. Felt too small. Material: 100% polyester, inserts, 64% polyester, 6% elastane. Compared to the non 2.0 which I have, the material feels more glossy/slippery. Slightly weird.</div><div class="p" id="_286">2023-05: <a href="https://www.wiggle.com/p/dhb-classic-shorts?color=black&amp;sizeStandard=M">www.wiggle.com/p/dhb-classic-shorts?color=black&amp;sizeStandard=M</a> dhb Classic Shorts, medium.</div><div class="p" id="_287">2022-05: buying another "dhb Lightweight Mesh Long Sleeve Base Layer", small <a href="https://www.wiggle.com/p/dhb-lightweight-mesh-long-sleeve-base-layer">www.wiggle.com/p/dhb-lightweight-mesh-long-sleeve-base-layer</a>. I notice that it is actually a bit not long enough.

For sun/fall protection. In theory should be small according to size guide, but small was over, and I have my doubts it is correct.</div><div class="p" id="_290">2021-12: bought a North Face etip recycled gloves black with white signs, large about 40 dollars: <a href="https://www.thenorthface.co.uk/shop/en-gb/tnf-gb/mens-etip-gloves-4sha?variationId=KY4">www.thenorthface.co.uk/shop/en-gb/tnf-gb/mens-etip-gloves-4sha?variationId=KY4</a> let's see how that goes.</div><div class="p" id="_291">2021-12:<div class="list"><ul id="_292"><li id="_293">dhb Windproof Cycling Gloves Small Black 33 dollars to replace the Nike academy hyperwam gloves which I lost a pair of recently. It already had a hole in the thumb anyways from shifting the small gears all the time.

Felt really good. Really does not trap much heat, and completely blocks off sun. It makes you develop a small layer of sweat that keeps you cool, cooler than without the sleeves.</div><div class="p" id="_296">2021-02 Castelli PRO THERMAL SKULLY red <a href="https://www.wiggle.co.uk/castelli-pro-thermal-skully">www.wiggle.co.uk/castelli-pro-thermal-skully</a> <a href="https://www.castelli-cycling.com/gb/pro-thermal-skully/p/452054220A">www.castelli-cycling.com/gb/pro-thermal-skully/p/452054220A</a> to help with cold, the X Lite Run Black Headband is just not made for winter.</div><div class="p" id="_297">2021-01: Madison Cycle Everywear Sportive Toe covers.

Basically it becomes wet with your transpiration, but is still relatively warm, would take it well down to 5C. Likely would work well with heavy <a href="../astronomy#rain">rain</a>. Not bad. But does feel a bit cooler than the Extremities XDRY, especially after you walk for a bit, and your hand becomes cold, and it is very hard to warm it because it is also wet.</div><div class="p" id="_299">2020-12-21: "dhb Neoprene Nylon Overshoes" <a href="https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-neoprene-nylon-overshoes">www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-neoprene-nylon-overshoes</a> large black. After 2 rides, noticed that the front lower part of left foot (the one I put on and off the most) had a hole in it, not sure where it was made. Edit: I later noticed that it is because I have the reflex of braking slightly with my shoes in certain conditions, e.g. at lower speeds in close proximity to pedestrians, the sounds of which also serve as a way to alert them without the need for a loud bell. But it destroys the overshoe, so I have to undo that reflex.</div><div class="p" id="_300">2020-11-06 <a href="https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/castelli-perfetto-ros-long-sleeve-cycling-jersey/">www.alpinetrek.co.uk/castelli-perfetto-ros-long-sleeve-cycling-jersey/</a> "Castelli Perfetto RoS Long Sleeve - Cycling jersey" size L Large.

Together with the dhb Merino Long Sleeve Base Layer, I can gown down to 0 Celcius, no problem, and up to 14 with the "Mesh Long Sleeve Base Layer". Breathes great, blocks wind and rain reasonably, and can holds mild rain out on a short 1.5h ride without problem.

Hopefully not being marked as "thermal" means it is less warm. Also hopefully being DHB Aeron it will be a bit less baggy behind knees.
