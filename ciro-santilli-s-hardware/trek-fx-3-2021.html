So the ranges are very comparable! This confirms Ciro's suspicion that 3 speeds on cranckset is just useless.</div><div class="p" id="_7">I was sized just at the lower limit of XL, but decided to go for it.

Tried both Kryptonite and Abus ones I have lying around. Shame. Also the Topeak MTS Trunkbag does not fit well on the pannier rack, it is not wide enough to strap: 11cm outer width, 9cm inner width, same geometry as that of the Liv bike.</div><div class="p" id="_20">Log:</div><div class="p" id="_21">2025-09-30: kickstand broken while taking it on car. Proceeding to buy Bontrager Rear Mount Adjustable Kickstand <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/equipment/bike-accessories/bike-kickstands/bontrager-rear-mount-adjustable-kickstand/p/36015/">www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/equipment/bike-accessories/bike-kickstands/bontrager-rear-mount-adjustable-kickstand/p/36015/</a> 20 pounds + 4 delivery. The new kickstand is slightly different from the previous one, it is less slick looking, but perhaps a bit more sturdy, notably the little arm is shorter which might help prevent the previous failure mode. It came with 3 types of screws, but the two of correct diameter were a bit shorter or longer than the old ones so I just kept the old ones.</div><div class="p" id="_22">2025-09-13: chain reached 0.75, rebuying KMC X9. x9 9 speed chain 114 links. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07J38GX7L">www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07J38GX7L</a></div><div class="p" id="_23">2025-08: rear mudgard broke in the exact same way as last time, so I'm saying fuck this bullshit and I just fixed it up with some wire which will likely be more resistant than the shitty metal thing they had.</div><div class="p" id="_24">2025-06-26: I suddenly lost the ability to shift the front gear, cable seemed fine, upon inspection I noticed that the pedal could move sideways. Maybe linked to screeching sound that has been coming from that area for a while. As per <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPQyQnNdews">www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPQyQnNdews</a> leading to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqBtB8Kyl2U">www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqBtB8Kyl2U</a> this is a different system from the Kross one, two piece compression slotted rather than 3 piece. The side to side issue is mentioned precisely at: <a href="https://youtu.be/QqBtB8Kyl2U?t=357">youtu.be/QqBtB8Kyl2U?t=357</a> Buying the standalone removal tool: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Professional-Extracto-Compatible-Hollowtech-Maintenance/dp/B0DP6QF11X">www.amazon.co.uk/Professional-Extracto-Compatible-Hollowtech-Maintenance/dp/B0DP6QF11X</a> Fixing it fixed the shift issue, but I noticed that the little plastic piece was broken. Also a few days later it became loose again during a ride, but thankfully I had the tool and put it back mid rid. TODO wanted to rebuy it but it's really hard to find... Going to try this one: <a href="https://www.bikeparts.co.uk/products/shimano-altus-fc-mt210-chainset-46-30-9-speed-black-170-mm-w-o-chainguard">www.bikeparts.co.uk/products/shimano-altus-fc-mt210-chainset-46-30-9-speed-black-170-mm-w-o-chainguard</a> 175 mm and see if it comes with both arms. Bought it. has both arms. But I can't fit it, appears to be 1 or 2 mm short compared to the other cranck, the new arm does go on the old crank. There is a small rubber seal that is perhaps not too well inserted which might be to blame? Fuck my life! On the old one, it seems to be fully inserted into a tight hole. I didn't manage to insert the new one enough to make it fit, but if I remove it then it fits... just removing it for now then, how important could that be? Famous last words. Web says 12-14 nM torque on holding screws.</div><div class="p" id="_25">2025-06: rebuying 2x Shimano B05S brake pads, breaking is not too great and I don't want to repeat last year's episode of on-road failure. Will also be bleeding for the second time, God help me. The old pads weren't too bad, but I replaced them anyways. The bleeding was a failure and the brakes were too soft to be useful at the end, fuck. Went to two bike shops, both said bleeding not too bad, one said likely problem was contamination/friction issues. Tried cleaning rotors further, improved. Buying sandpaper and new rotors as well 2x SHIMANO SM-RT26 6-Bolt Disc Rotor and also got two more brake pads, totalling 3 new before I start putting them in with new rotor.</div><div class="p" id="_26">2025-04: rear shift cable snapped near shifter when going over a cattle grid, was already a bit off in the previous days after last adjust I then noticed. I'll buy a SHIMANO Gear Inner Wire Y60098070 on Amazon and might pass by bike shop as well I'll see.</div><div class="p" id="_27">2025-03: rear middle metal connection broke off read mudguard. Rebuying £21.04 from: <a href="https://www.tritoncycles.co.uk/frames-forks-c6/frame-fork-spares-c152/eurofender-snello-700c-fenders-46mm-rear-p33330/s93941">www.tritoncycles.co.uk/frames-forks-c6/frame-fork-spares-c152/eurofender-snello-700c-fenders-46mm-rear-p33330/s93941</a> Quite disappointed with that, didn't come with any screws, though perhaps these are frame dependant. And the drilling was a bit different, this model seems to be intended to have some wiring passing inside via some rubber tubes that I removed, and unfortunately the hole on front was too high up and didn't match up with the screw hole on frame. I just removed the broken metal piece from it and put it on the old mudguard.</div><div class="p" id="_28">2024-09: buying CHUMXINY Brake Bleed Kit: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CXDQ2S1S">www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CXDQ2S1S</a> I hope I don't regret this. But I can't find an original one on Amazon either so... £12.74. Quality is a bit crap but seems to work. The 7mm wrench however is so bad that it can't unscrew a 7mm nut.</div><div class="p" id="_29">2024-09: chain reached 0.75, rebuying KMC X9. x9 9 speed chain 114 links: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07J38GX7L">www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07J38GX7L</a></div><div class="p" id="_30">2024-09: when going down a hill in intense breaking, noise started coming from back disk brake. Tried to adjust, but made it worse, had to bail out on nearby bike shop. Readjusted, told me to replace back pads and likely bleed. Bought two Shimano B05S brake pads to replace the B01S that came with the bike, Internet says compatible. Brake maintenance finally caught up with me, it was a great summer and I kept putting it off. Changed just the back one for now, front still has life it seems.</div><div class="p" id="_31">2024-06: noticed a sideways lump on back tyre between spoke 23 and 24 when washing. The only sign of damage was internal near grip part, I could see some clear shearing... God those tyres are crap, or at least crap to what I've subjected them. Inner tube and outside seem perfect, so weird. If only the Schawlbe had worked! But OK now I'm forced to get something new and better, thinking:<div class="list"><ul id="_32"><li id="_33"><a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/equipment/cycling-components/bike-tyres/hybrid-bike-tyres/bontrager-h2-hard-case-ultimate-reflective-hybrid-tyre/p/31553">www.trekbikes.com/gb/en_GB/equipment/cycling-components/bike-tyres/hybrid-bike-tyres/bontrager-h2-hard-case-ultimate-reflective-hybrid-tyre/p/31553</a> seems Schwalbe like, but will it fit?</li></ul></div>They had a Schwalbe Marathon Plus 700x35c (non-Tour, as that one  didn't fit as per previous experiment) on the shop and I went for it. They said 35c was the maximum recommended for that mudgard which is a bit of a shame, but good to know. Also getting one from Amazon to match on front as shop only had one.</div><div class="p" id="_34">2024-04: micropuncture on front tube? Could not identify during ride, refilled and was OK to get home. Almost no pressure in middle of ride. Passed through some deep water which may have made things worse? Had a small pice of glass-like material stuck in tyre, but didn't seem to penetrate? One day and a half later, was full empty again after full fill without riding, so confirming micropuncture theory. Buying 2x Conti Tube Cross 28 (700C) presta inner tubes.</div><div class="p" id="_35">Tried to put a spare Schwalbe Men's Marathon Plus Tour 700x40C on the bike to get better stability. It seemed to fit the wheel quite well, but unfortunately failed to go well in the fork because it was too tall and hit the mudgard. Without mudgard it might work. Measured height was 6cm for Schwalbe vs 5.3cm for the stock one.</div><div class="p" id="_36">2024-02: another broken spoke... what crappy weak wheels!!! Bought Bavel 290 mm spokes 36pcs 14G J Bend Silver. Broken position was 22nd clockwise from inner tube valve hole.</div><div class="p" id="_37">2023-12: chain reached 0.75, rebuying KMC X9. x9 9 speed chain 114 links.</div><div class="p" id="_38">2023-12: broken spoke!
