Seller confirmed it is this one <a href="https://www.kross.pl/en/2012/trans-alp">www.kross.pl/en/2012/trans-alp</a> (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200426174741/https://www.kross.pl/en/2012/trans-alp">archive</a>) but male version (now shown clearly on website, but both exist).</div><div class="p" id="_85">2024-02: noticed pump was finally stolen. Certainly the drug addicts can't even get 1 dollar for it. TODO identify and rebuy.</div><div class="p" id="_86">2023-08: redoing drivetrain: Shimano HG51 8 Speed cassette 11-32t, Shimano HG40 8-speed chain, Shimano FC-M311 48T/38T/28T 175mm cranckset, first two from Amazon, last from <a href="https://www.santafixie.co.uk/shimano-altus-fc-m311-175-mm-crankset-black.html">www.santafixie.co.uk/shimano-altus-fc-m311-175-mm-crankset-black.html</a> does not include elivery but still was the cheapest I could find, 4 pounds. Likely not worth the signup effort, but we gotta fight Amazon when they are beaten on prices for moral reasons...</div><div class="p" id="_87">2023-03: Rebuying HG40 8 speed chain 116L, Never paid attention to link counts before, dude said I might have to remove two. There are three options 114L, 116L and 118L</div><div class="p" id="_88">2022-08 I can't take the cassette out anymore again... first tried to remove correct side, didn't manage. Tried the other side, wrong one, and it ticked about 10 times. Then saw video, and initial side was correct. That piece is extremely asymmetric... it is a problem.</div><div class="p" id="_89">2022-08: front mudgard was unbearably noisy, put on the new one I had bought long ago. Asked bike shope person to cut 2.5cm from each metal stick which was way way too long, measured this quickly by placing the new one on top of the new one without attaching. After I got home, noticed it was still too long. At home I noticed one was better than the other, this is because the attach point is not centric on the wheel like on the back, so it requires different cuts. Going to cut again 1cm on one side, 2cm on the other, so total from start would have been 3.5cm and 4.5cm.</div><div class="p" id="_90">Got a puncture on back tire, perfect little point, but on the interior. Could not determine cause. Noticed that the "thumbs up" patch sets that came with the COZYROOMY tire lever were kind of crap, barely held. Made test to see if will deflat or not. Bought a Weldtite cure-c-cure puncture repair kit instead: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003GBBQGM">www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003GBBQGM</a>. Looks good.</div><div class="p" id="_91">seatpost making clicking noises again... seems to be from collar area, since already changed several time seatpost. Went to shop and they: 1) cleaned surfaces with rag and some cleaning oil 2) aligned hole in tighenener thing with that of frame 3) tightened well. Let's see. People also recommend greasing the clamp bolt:<div class="list"><ul id="_92"><li id="_93"><a href="https://www.bikeforums.net/bicycle-mechanics/727003-how-stop-clicking-seatpost.html">www.bikeforums.net/bicycle-mechanics/727003-how-stop-clicking-seatpost.html</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="p" id="_94">2022-08: Topeak Aero Wedge saddle bag stolen in city center, bought many years ago, don't have exact product. Quite incredible that something so cheap, unsellable, and unusable except by a sportsperson would be stolen. Looks like this: <a href="https://archive.ph/wip/atSJK">archive.ph/wip/atSJK</a>, not like the identically named 2022 produc with two zippers.

Exchanged for the small.</div><div class="p" id="_95">Rebuying HG40 8 speed chain.</div><div class="p" id="_96">2022-05: weighed the bicycle for the first time. 17 kg without any optionals</div><div class="p" id="_97">Broke front part of front mudgard when trying to put bicycle in bike bag without front wheel. Fuck. Surprisingly brittle.</div><div class="p" id="_98">2022-04: could not remove pedals with small 10cm wrench, preparing for trip. Took it to mechanic, they removed without any problem with a Park Tool PW-4, and greased. Glad to see it was not stuck. After that, I was able to remove myself with my 10cm non specialized wrench. Considering getting the Park Tool PW-5 instead of PW-4 which is half the price and just a bit less long. OK Bought it.</div><div class="p" id="_99">2022-03: changed chain after it reached the limit. Very slight slippage on gear 6 as usual, but did not seem enough to require changing the cassette, but rebuying it as soon as I find a good price for next chain for sure, rebuying Shimano HG51 8 Speed 11-32t. OMG it is so expensive now, stocks our out everywhere!</div><div class="p" id="_100">Besides that, have been hearing some noises from the seat post that are worrying me... it never ends... rebuying a Brand-X Layback Seatpost 27.2 diameter 350mm length post to debug.</div><div class="p" id="_101">Also getting Shimano SM-SH56 cleat, there was a deal with 3 pairs so getting 3 pairs now.</div><div class="p" id="_102">2021-11: seatpost making noises again... going to try a Brand-X Layback Seatpost 27.2 diameter, which does not have the useless suspension, and has a double bolt system, and sells on wiggle which is a good sign.</div><div class="p" id="_103">2021-11: 3 days after a ride, tire was empty, thought it was vandalism. Inspected, could not see any issues, did a 75km ride, and left a gain, and again it lost air quickly. Opened up tire, and found a thorn of some plant pierced inside, almost invisible from the outside. It also feels like the thorn stuck in place and reduced the rate of air loss, after removing the tube it lost air quite quickly. Could not fully remove thorn, can still feel it with my finger, but too well stuck in tire, but I don't think it is enough to pierce again, I just put a patch set on top of it, and new tube Schwalbe 700C 28'' AV 17, got two of those.</div><div class="p" id="_104">2021-11: trickling noise coming from front wheel. Going to get a new one without the generator which I have use anyways and see if it solves it: <a href="https://www.tredz.co.uk/.M-Part-Shimano-Deore-Hub-on-Mavic-A319-700c-Rim-Complete-Wheel_35638.htm">www.tredz.co.uk/.M-Part-Shimano-Deore-Hub-on-Mavic-A319-700c-Rim-Complete-Wheel_35638.htm</a> M Part Shimano Deore Hub On Mavic A319 700c Rim Complete Wheel.

Found out that the one I bought did not have a quicklink... Also, it did not come in the original package, but in a sealed plastic bag, presumably to reduce shipping costs. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XVQ2O0">www.amazon.com/dp/B004XVQ2O0</a> have to be more careful next time. Lost the Shimano 500ml bottle, was strapped on back carrier of bike, but not safe enough, and I went through rough terrain. Had seen it fall off once before another time, but very rare. When I noticed, had no idea where it had fallen off and didn't go back for it.

Luckily <a href="../amazon">Amazon</a> made me buy two Versamounts, because I needed to use one for each bottle, as the holes on the frame were too close to the bottom and made it impossible to fit both otherwise.</div><div class="p" id="_114">2021-09-05: chain reached 0.75, rebuying HG40 8. Also buying second set of break pads, front is gone, and back almost, gonna swap both at once.</div><div class="p" id="_115">2021-08: back side of teeth of seat post wore off, and the seat is rotating vertically. Identification: markings: ELC (maybe middle letter worn off). 27.2 diameter / 350, 350 is the length from Googling. Has a simple shock absorber system and a single pin to attach the seat.

TODO was it in the same place as the previous puncture? Not far from Schwalbe mark.

Seems to be the same symptom as 2020-12 when cassette was worn off, as the shifting itself seems fine. <a href="https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/8378/difference-between-shimano-hg51-8-speed-cassette-and-shimano-hg50-8-speed-casset">bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/8378/difference-between-shimano-hg51-8-speed-cassette-and-shimano-hg50-8-speed-casset</a> says hg51 is compatible, so getting that newer model. 11-34t was much more expensive/less common than 11-32, so getting 11-32. Managed to install it without any problems.</div><div class="p" id="_118">2021-08: bought Shimano HG40 8 speed chain and put it on bike</div><div class="p" id="_119">2021-07:<div class="list"><ul id="_120"><li id="_121">rear shift cable snapped inside shifter during rid, same as 2020-10, same symptom that could never index higher tension gears well bought new cable</li><li id="_122">chain reached 0.75+</li><li id="_123">tried to put front mudgard on, but several problems on this one. The screws needed are wider than those that come. Could keep old ones. But then on top of that, the metal bars are too long and would need cutting about 2 cm, so keeping the old front mudgard for now, which is working perfectly.</li></ul></div></div><div class="p" id="_124">2021-06-05: finally removed the old bottom bracket and installed installed the one I had bought a few months back. What triggered this was the clicking noise back again. It appears that the noise got louder with the heat. The clicking noise went away after changing the new bottom bracket. The old bracket seemed fine after inspecting it closely after removal. There was a bit of dirt/earth inside, and some small chippings came out of one side, not sure if from BB or from the frame itself. There are still some other much less loud noises left however, but they are likely a different source, and not a big issue. The clicking noise: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXBdPg1LhQU">www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXBdPg1LhQU</a></div><div class="p" id="_125">2021-05: got the first flat tire ever on the back wheel! A perfectly shaped pointed triangular rock slotted perfectly into the thread and managed to perforate the inner tube. Managed to patch it up perfectly on the road, 2 hours away from home! The inside of the tire is basically intact, so I'm going to keep using it. The next day I put back an old intact inner tube I had replaced preemptively earlier on with this new one that was punctured.</div><div class="p" id="_126">2021-04: put on the Bluemels mudgard on the back. It wasn't hard, and their system seems quite easy to adjust. Chain reached 1.0 stretch, gotta get a new one.</div><div class="p" id="_127">2021-03: clicking noise when pedalling strong driving me crazy.
