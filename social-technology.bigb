Rasselas Prince of Abyssinia CHAPTER VIII https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/652/pg652-images.html[]:
\Q[Oppression is, in the Abyssinian dominions, neither frequent nor tolerated; but no form of government has been yet discovered by which cruelty can be wholly prevented. Subordination supposes power on one part and subjection on the other; and if power be in the hands of men it will sometimes be abused. The vigilance of the supreme magistrate may do much, but much will still remain undone. He can never know all the crimes that are committed, and can seldom punish all that he knows.]

This is a must if the people want to regain control of their society from apathetic politicians.

I would also increase voter percentage due to convenience, and reduce the weight of voting fraud cases, as everyone would be able to check that their own vote was counted correctly.

And then, we would be able to have <referendums> for basically any important decision being made. No need to go out on the streets and waste your time in a mass protest! Just vote!

It is possible to implement anonymous electronic voting with <ring signatures>, an algorithm also used by <Monero>, an <anonymity> focused <cryptocurrency>, as mentioned e.g. on this 2004 paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/281.pdf[]. The system can be set in a way such that you can only deanonymize someone if everyone else, or a very large number of people, conspire against that person.

The same system could also be used to setup forums where only citizens of the country could comment and propose changes and vote on them.

With electronic voting, we could have a system where you can let someone you trust vote for you automatically, or vote automatically for certain subjects alone, a bit like we do by electing senators. But then you would also be able to override specific votes if you wanted to.

In this system therefore, anyone who can proxy vote has to have their vote public, and placed in a decent website that shows clearly who voted for what.

  OK, set "Most recent posts" on "Feed preferences" and it seems to work.
* <How to view only posts by followed on Facebook feed?>

It must have been some A/B testing overload that made that decision to try and make things more addictive for everyone. Or perhaps as a way to drive revenue with people paying to cheat the algorithm and boost their posts.

Obviously, a few large instances dominate the user base for all practical purposes: https://kevq.uk/centralisation-and-mastodon/[]. And likely the network splits into hate-speech/non-hate-speech blacklist boundaries. And since the dominating closed networks will never lose user counts (???), the only instance that dominates will be the main hate speech one.

Our minimal definition of "electronic money" is the following.

Each citizen or legal entity has an account there, and transfers between registered users are just simple API calls.

 So for example you would e able to put all your money in the government account instead of using useless banks. And then you would invest it as you want with the investment company of your choice, without tying the "my money is here" with "this is the best investment" aspects of banks.

{c}
{parent=Electronic money}
{tag=GNU package}

Centralized system that still attempts some level of privacy.

In it, a central bank issue tokens that are stored offline in your cell phone, a bit like cash bank notes.

When you take those tokens, a corresponding amount gets removed from your bank account, a bit like cash bank notes.

When a transaction is made, tokens are put into a spent token list via central API, and cannot be double spent thereafter. The corresponding ammount is then added to the bank account of the receiver. This also means that offline transactions are not possible.

When emitting, the bank signs the token with their private key. When spending, the bank checks that signature.

How do we prevent the bank from logging which token goes to which user besides trusting that they are running the software we whink they are running? Notably, couldn't timing be used to identify that?

TODO how does it work exactly? Do they ask for permission from authors in every case, including when the content has <open license>? Or when it has open license, do they just do it? In some cases, the notes have no license, so they must have asked.

TODO what is the source code that authors write? <LaTeX> or something else? <LaTeX> feels extremely likely given that it is what most original materials were already written in.

They are attempting a "model up this entire university" thing: https://phys.libretexts.org/Courses which is good. E.g. they have a bunch of "quantum mechanics ones under: https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Quantum_Mechanics

They claim to use this closed source backend: https://www.nice.com/resources/cxone-expert-knowledge-management[]? Seriously? For a publicly funded project with low-tech requirements?? It is <mind blowing>.

Some issues:
* the internal cross references are somewhat broken as of 2022.
* their URLs are HUGE! All components of every ancestor are in it. E.g. check this out: https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Quantum_Mechanics/Introductory_Quantum_Mechanics_(Fitzpatrick)/12%3A_Time-Dependent_Perturbation_Theory/12.13%3A_Forbidden_Transitions Insane.

This is an interesting initiative which has some similarities to <Ciro Santilli>'s <OurBigBook> project.

The fatal flaw of the initiative in <Ciro Santilli>'s opinion is the lack of <#user-generated content>. We will never get there without UGC and algorithms, never.

Also as of 2021, it mostly useless business courses: https://learn.saylor.org unfortunately.

But it has several redeeming factors which Ciro Santilli aproves of:
* <exam as a service>-like
* they have a <GitHub>: https://github.com/saylordotorgo

Licensing appears to be a mixed mess between the dreaded <CC BY-NC-SA> and the good <CC BY>, e.g.:
* https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introduction-to-economic-analysis/s00-license.html is <CC BY-NC-SA>
* but https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://learn.saylor.org/?redirect=0 is <CC BY> on footer

The founder <Michael J. Saylor> looks a bit crooked, <Rich people who create charitable prizes are often crooked> comes to mind. But maybe he's just weird.

\Q[When I go, all my assets will flow into a foundation, and the foundation's mission is to make education free for everybody forever.]
What statement... maybe he's actually not crooked, maybe it was just an accounting mistake... <God>, why.

If only <Ciro Santilli> knew how to contact him and convince him that his current approach is innefective and that Ciro has something better! Michael, please <Google> into this page some day, <Ciro Santilli> needs funding for <OurBigBook.com>. A hopeless Tweet at: https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1548350114623660035[]. Also tried to hit his `saylor@strategy.com`.

* https://twitter.com/saylor 2.6 M followers as of 2022. Because of <Bitcoin>? Or was he famous before that?
* https://www.michael.com/ yes, he is Michael.com lol. When did he get the domain, and at what price? He's mildlly obsessed with domain names it seems: https://www.domainsherpa.com/saylor/[]. He also bought `frank.com`, `mike.com`. `emma.com`. This was between 1994 and 2000. He mentions that his email is `saylor@strategy.com`. `strategy.com` redirects to `microstrategy.com` as of 2022, so seems still valid.

  We actually got a backlink from https://tvt.phishlabs.com[] to this page in August 2022, a <phising> security provider, presumably for showing his email here. This reminds Ciro of the <All GitHub Commit Emails> event!

  A quick google for that address also leads to https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/liveonline/00/business/saylor0621.htm[], a year 2000 profile page by the Washington Post, followed by a Q&A. In the Q&A, Michael himself gives his email in relation to <Saylor Academy>:
  \Q[
  Kensington, Maryland: What has happened to your vision of an internet university? I believe it is an important initiative and it doesn't require \$100 million to get started. We at the <Rockefeller Foundation> would like to become involved. How can we do this?

  Michael Saylor: The internet university is alive and well. My goal is to initially roll out a cyber-libary of digital video that can be used by any for-profit or non-profit organization in order to accelerate the free education initiative. Eventually, people may just go direct to the web site.

  I think the entire thing will unfold over about 10 years.

  Send me an email if you would like to get involved. (saylor@strategy.com)
  ]
  so it was already beyond leaked. Ciro did hit that email address seeking funding for <OurBigBook.com>, but no reply unfortunately. Maybe you gotta be part of the Rockefeller family to get a reply from these people? Well, at least this led to Ciro learning about the Rockefeller Foundation.

It is harder to measure the impact of nonprofits than of for-profits, since you can't just look at their bank balances.

This is one fundamental difficulty of nonprofit work, how to prove that you deserve the investments and not someone else.

{parent=Social technology}

Generally, prizes that pay big lumps of money to well established individuals are a bit useless, it would be better to pay smaller sums to struggling beginners in the field, of which there are aplenty.

The most important part about prizes should not be the money, nor the recognition, but rather explaining better what the laureates did. In this, most prizes fail. Thus <Ciro Santilli>'s project idea: <Project to explain each Nobel Prize better>.

By <Zuckerberg>. The selection seems decent. And <natural sciences> only, which is good. A bit more application oriented than the <Nobel Prize> it seems, e.g. 2022 separates physics and fundamental physics.

Appears to explain award reasoning even worse than the <Nobel Foundation>.

The <Royal Society>'s <Nobel Prize>.

https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/copley-medal/ says it is now open to international citizens, but having a quick look at the 2010 awards still suggests that it is very British centric, or at least anglophone centric, much like the society fellowship itself. That's likely the reason why the Nobel prize won, being much more international from the start.

<Ciro Santilli> approves of this one, related: <free gifted education>{full}.

The downside of the Thiel Fellowship is that it is realistically impossible for its fellows to do anything in <deep tech>, only information science startups would be possible, as they would not have the labs, or lab skills required for any deep tech if they drop out before a <PhD>. Related: <The only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories>{full}.

The only solution is the harder process of actually remodelling our very <broken educational system>.

= Turing Award

The <Nobel Prize> of <computer> <software> or <computer hardware>[hardware]!

More like a "lifetime achievement" though, rather than the Nobel Prize, which tends to be for more specific achievements.

= Knowledge olympiads
{parent=Prize}

E.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad[International Mathematical Olympiad], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Physics_Olympiad[International Physics Olympiad], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming[competitive programming], etc.

Events that trick young kids into thinking that they are making progress, but only serve to distract them from what really matters, which is to dominate a <state of the art> as fast as possible, contact researches in the area, and publish truly <novel results>.

Financially backed by high schools trying to make ads showing how they will turn your kids into geniuses (but also passionate teachers who fell into this hellish system), or companies who hire machines rather than entrepreneurs.

The most triggering thing possible is when programming competitions don't release their benchmarks as <open source software> afterwards: at least like that they might help someone to solve their real world problems. Maybe.

On a related note, hackathons are also mostly useless. Instead of announcing a hackathon, just announce a web forum where people with similar interests can talk to one another instead, and let them code it out on <GitHub> if they want to. Restricting intensive development to a few days tends to produce crappy code and not reach real goals.

Some https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artur_Avila[irrelevant people] highlight https://youtu.be/jz-41LxrI_M?t=46[that knowledge Olympiads can have good effects], because they are "an opportunity to meet university teachers and their research organizations". Ciro's argument is just that there are much more efficient ways to achieve those goals.

As an alternative way to get into university, this is not 100% horrible however, e.g. the <University of São Paulo> accepted students from olympiads in 2019 and then again 2023: https://jornal.usp.br/institucional/usp-oferece-200-vagas-em-mais-de-100-cursos-de-graduacao-para-alunos-participantes-de-olimpiadas-do-conhecimento/?a

Life is too short for that. Companies must either notice that you can make amazing <open source software> projects or contributions, and hire you for that, or they must <fuck> off.
