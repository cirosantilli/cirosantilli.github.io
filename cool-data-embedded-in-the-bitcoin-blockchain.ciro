= Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain

{wiki}

This is a list of cool stuff found using techniques mentioned at: \x[how-to-extract-data-from-the-bitcoin-blockchain]{full}.

Notably, \x[ciro-santilli] developed his own set of scripts at https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txid to find some of this data.

\x[hidden-surprises-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain-by-ken-shirriff-2014] is a mandatory precursor to this article, and potentially contains some of the most interesting examples already.

An attempt is made to not repeat stuff that is already said in that article. Some repetition happened by accident, as we explored and only later noticed it was already mentioned there. But there are also some new aspects of existing comments.

\x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china][China stuff] is shown at: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/#bitcoin-blockchain[].

= Base58 messages
{parent=cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain}

Bitcoin addresses are by convention expressed in \x[base58], which is a human readable \x[binary-to-text-encoding] invented by Bitcoin. It is a bit like \x[base64], but obsessed with eliminating characters that look like one another in popular but stupid fonts like capital "I" and lower case ell "l".

The following transactions contain base58 encoded messages on addresses.

This seems to be one of the earliest strategies used to encode messages.

These messages were originally found with: https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids#payload-size-out-utxo-2vals

The generated text is however rather obfuscated by the limitations of Base58.

= Interesting input script data
{parent=cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain}

Data in input and output transactions are quite different because:
* input transaction data can only be added by the miner who obtained the block.

  Input script transactions can only contain arbitrary data when they are made by miners that obtained the block.

  Therefore, except at the very early beginnings when random individuals could still mine without having a nuclear power station at their disposal, basically all input script transactions are boring ads made by mining pools or other souless companies.

  As a result, inputs contain almost exclusively boring miner advertisements.
* output transaction data however can be added by anyone who makes a transaction.

  Therefore, although the large majority of it is also crap and spam like the rest of the \x[internet], there is much more interesting stuff to be found there in total.

Here are some exceptionally interesting input data that are not mentioned in other sections:
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/in/0268.txt#L10[tx 61e26d407c17e8ee33a8b166c78f78c53cdcdc0078ae1f9405e6583cfb90eaf4]:  has an is exceptionally cute miner message:

= Prayer wars
{parent=interesting-input-script-data}

Starting at https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/in/0139.txt#L1[tx cbbaa0a64924fe1d6ace3352f23242aa0028d4e0ff6ae8ed615244d66079cfb1] with one line per transaction:
``
Eligius/Benedictus Deus. Benedictum Nomen Sanctum eius
``

Because it is one line per transaction, it could got broken up by some interspersed atheist mockery graffiti, e.g.:
``
Benedicta sancta eius et immaculata Conceptio.
   I LIKE TURTLES
Benedicta eius gloriosa Assumptio.
Benedictum Nomen Iesu.
Benedictus Iesus in sanctissimo altaris Sacramento.
C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
Benedictus sanctus Ioseph, eius castissimus Sponsus
``

The non-obvious interruptions are all well known memes/anime references:
* "I like turtles": https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-like-turtles
* Combo breaker: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/combo-breaker
* "Yukkuri Shiteitte ne": https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yukkuri-shiteitte-ne
* "kLhLUKE-JR IS A PEDOPHILE! Oh, and god isn't real, sucka. Stop polluting the blockchain with your nonsense."
* "Help me, ERINNNNNN!!": https://touhou.fandom.com/wiki/Lyrics:_Help_me,_ERINNNNNN!!

It should be noted however, that the interruptions we've found were all output transactions, therefore not done by miners, but just by regular transfers, which are much easier to make. In this sense, therefore, the prayer did win.

Later comments attribute the prayers to a Luke Jr., who is likely: https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr[], who says is a Roman Catholic on his Twitter introduction. This is consistent with him being one of the early miners.

= Illegal content of block 229k
{parent=cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain}

These can be viewed at https://bitcoinstrings.com/blk00052.txt[].

Soon after block 229991 uploaded the \x[satoshi-uploader], several interesting files were added to the blockchain, and notably some containing content that might be \x[illegal] in certain \x[country]{p}, although enforcement seems unlikely:
* tx 08654f9dc9d673b3527b48ad06ab1b199ad47b61fd54033af30c2ee975c588bd block 229999 contains a leaked private key and a link to: http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/ami-firmware-source-codAe-private-key-leaked-040513

As mentioned in \x[hidden-surprises-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain-by-ken-shirriff-2014], it has an ASCII list of several other transactions, which presumably when downloaded with the \x[satoshi-uploader] can concatenated lead to the full 7z file. Also as mentioned by Ken, it is infinitely easier for the average user to just access the cables directly on \x[wikileaks] :-)
* tx dde7cd8e8f073a525c16c5ee4e4a254f847b7ad6babef257231813166fbef551 block 230229 and tx 4a0088a249e9099d205fb4760c28275d4b8965ac9fd56f5ddf6771cdb0d94f38 block 230231 contain indexes of pages from \x[the-hidden-wiki]. These can be viewed at: https://bitcoinstrings.com/blk00052.txt

So basically, this was the first obviously illegal block attempt.

= Images
{parent=cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain}

The huge majority of images is encoded with the \x[atomsea-embii] system/format. All images in that system will be documented in that section.

Non-Atomsea & EMBII images follow.

Custom encoding:
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/out/0123.txt#L11[tx ceb1a7fb57ef8b75ac59b56dd859d5cb3ab5c31168aa55eb3819cd5ddbd3d806] has `bitcoin.jpg` which contains the bitcoin logo. The image, encoding and conversion script given described at \x[hidden-surprises-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain-by-ken-shirriff-2014].

  As mentioned there, the logo is split across two transactions: ceb1a7fb57ef8b75ac59b56dd859d5cb3ab5c31168aa55eb3819cd5ddbd3d806 and 9173744691ac25f3cd94f35d4fc0e0a2b9d1ab17b4fe562acc07660552f95518. TODO how did Ken find out about the second one?

  It is true that the second one is the only other nearby that has have ASCII data. The second one ends in `776 crc32=a7ac8449` which must be part of yEnc. But are they related in any other more precise way?

  They are not even in the same block: https://blockchain.info/block/123573?format=json | https://blockchain.info/block/123571?format=json

Standard transaction output script hashes from \x[jpeg] or \x[png] from first byte found with https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids#image-indexing-and-download[]:

https://cryptograffiti.info

Bitcoin blockchain image indexer.

Stopped indexing Bitcoin and moved to Bitcoin Cash instead: https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/cryptograffiti-rejects-bitcoin-core-bch-now-available-payment-method/ and therefore became useless, is is now hard to match any of the images.

Searching for the Tank Man image hash ca4f11131eca6b4d61daf707a470cfccd1ef3d80a6f8b70f1f07616b451ca64e leads to https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/191157608/#q191162145 which claims URLs were of type https://cryptograffiti.info/#ca4f11131eca6b4d61daf707a470cfccd1ef3d80a6f8b70f1f07616b451ca64e.jpg but that is not working as of 2021.

Also, based on the timing of c206e8fff656f07b27dac831ef9b956792bae4e76a2cb43f14f49f0298bf2c2f which is discussed at \x[images], this service may be responsible for a large part of the raw JPEG images present in the blockchain from block 416527 onwards

= AtomSea & EMBII
{parent=images}

A text/file upload system.

http://bitfossil.org/ is the website system to view live indexed images, it has an abuse report to unindex presumably. TODO source? Local extraction script?

Each AtomSea payload has a toplevel transaction which links to other transactions. All the linked transactions together make up the payload. The most common payload type is a text plus image, as is the case of \x[nelson-mandela-jpg], which can be seen at http://bitfossil.com/78f0e6de0ce007f4dd4a09085e649d7e354f70bc7da06d697b167f353f115b8e/ where `78f0e6de0ce007f4dd4a09085e649d7e354f70bc7da06d697b167f353f115b8e` is the toplevel transaction ID: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/78f0e6de0ce007f4dd4a09085e649d7e354f70bc7da06d697b167f353f115b8e

http://apertus.io/ is the system to upload/index locally, and therefore likely part of the backend of bitfossil: https://github.com/HugPuddle/Apertus

The system shows the messages and the images on a single page: http://bitfossil.org/4cbb32cd27b5b5edc12d3559bdffc1355ac2a210463d5cfaadc7ce9b06675b2b/index.htm It is basically a blockchain-based Twitter.

\x[hidden-surprises-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain-by-ken-shirriff-2014] suggests that AtomSea & EMBII are the creator's aliases.

The following online profiles of the creators feel authentic:
* AtomSea:
  * https://twitter.com/TheAtomSea
  * https://github.com/AtomSea
* EMBII:
  * https://github.com/embiimob
  * Real name: likely "Eric Bobby" according to:

The first upload that we could find with https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txid#atomsea was http://bitfossil.org/c9d1363ea517cd463950f83168ce8242ef917d99cd6518995bd1af927d335828/ on block 272577 (2013-12-02). It reads:
\Q[I WONDER WHAT HISTORY WILL THINK ABOUT THESE FIRST FEW BUGS...HA HA HA. NOBODY IS PERFECT.]
which is perhaps a reference to a possible previous failed upload http://bitfossil.org/4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17/ This illustrates the beauty of the blockchain very well: unlike with \x[version-control], you don't just see selected snapshots: you see actual debug logs!!!

The second one is `WeAreStarStuff.jpg` http://bitfossil.org/8d1b3c094b782198deb7381efb57b1208244375e7a1029ec159306d6a8fd25d8 showingAtomSea and EMBII together.

Then comes a boring test `HugPuddle.jpg` http://bitfossil.org/86a0e565ba2698d4abc03253b9de47e88d3de4f62ee90722e6e7845a1c8e3aa7/

Best guess so far, all in ASCII hex of output scripts:
* remove the single output value different from first one from payload, that's the change, and it is randomly placed as far as I see
* 64 bytes: hex address of top level text
* 1 byte: some random punctuation
* decimal number of bytes of some payload
* 1 byte: some random punctuation
* 64 bytes: same as the first address
* CR LF
* ends in NUL

so unlike in \x[iloveyoumore-jpg], we do have the raw JPEG header data here starting with `ffd8`!

And there is a possible footer `ffd9` in the last file of the list 39348722b841afa0c5b67e5af10839afe965ed1b24874e89336bea9fa4ef3091!

However, when I put everything together, cutting around delimiters, it gives only the top half of the head! My data is 14960, not 14400. So there must be 460 bytes of metadata in some of the blocks, possibly error checking.

The actual data starting at `ffd8` and cutting off header/tails (20 bytes per transaction):

So it is really encoded one line at a time in the `script` of the transaction outputs.

Because it comes so early in the blockchain, and because it is basically the first ASCII art on the blochain, and because is so well done, this is by far the most visible ASCII art of the blockchain.

The transaction before the ASCII art tx 9b08c00ced2bca4525d74e82db9af2aec8ef213eb1c1bf68a48b6be929968332 starts with what is likely a "Legalize" and must be a \x[tor-onion-service]:

but that address as is + `.onion` is invalid, TODO find the correct one.

\x[/ascii-art] of a https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413591[Force of Will], a famous \x[magic-the-gathering] card.

If we add `-w` to `string -w` however, we see that the lines follow.

TODO understand exactly how it was encoded and why it is so weird. The `UUUU` has a slightly weird encoding which we fixed by hand here TODO understand.

\x[/rickrolling] lyrics were mined several times into the blockchain as mentioned at \x[interesting-input-script-data].

Around block https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/data/in/0264.txt#L28[block 246k] we note several transactions starting with a \x[xml] format `<CG SZ="1156"><MG>...` the first one being 0b4efe49ea1454020c4d51a163a93f726a20cd75ad50bb9ed0f4623c141a8008 As mentioned not very clearly at http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html#ref12 the content of the first `<MG><payload></MG>` is a \x[base64] encoded string

followed by lyrics also base64 encoded as part of the XML metadata. \x[hidden-surprises-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain-by-ken-shirriff-2014] was not able to identify the exact format either.

Protesters were posting large chunks of text multiple times into the blockchain as a way to protest against the controversial increase of block size.

* 623463a2a8a949e0590ffe6b2fd3e4e1028b2b99c747e82e899da4485eb0b6be and 5143cf232576ae53e8991ca389334563f14ea7a7c507a3e081fbef2538c84f6e both have 3,075 outputs of 1 satoshi each and a single input. We were not able to identify any meaningful data in it, `file` just says `data`, and there aren't long ASCII strings. However, the outputs were unspent as of 2021, which suggests that they might actually be data.

Analysis of some of them follows.

* dd9f6bbf80ab36b722ca95d93268667a3ea6938288e0d4cf0e7d2e28a7a91ab3 has 13107 with payload 256KB in size, but some of them at least have been spent: https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/dd9f6bbf80ab36b722ca95d93268667a3ea6938288e0d4cf0e7d2e28a7a91ab3 therefore it's not data. `file` says their payload is a DOS executable, but it must be a coincidence
