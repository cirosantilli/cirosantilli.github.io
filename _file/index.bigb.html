Check out: \b[https://OurBigBook.com], the best way to publish your scientific knowledge. It's an &lt;open source&gt; &lt;note taking system&gt; that can publish from &lt;lightweight markup&gt; files in your computer both to a multi-user \b[&lt;mind melding&gt;] dynamic website, or as a &lt;static website&gt;. It's like \b[&lt;Wikipedia&gt; + &lt;GitHub&gt; + &lt;Stack Overflow&gt; + &lt;Obsidian (software)&gt; mashed up]. Source code: \b[https://github.com/ourbigbook/ourbigbook].

&lt;sponsor&gt;[Sponsor me to work on this project]. For \b[400k &lt;USD&gt;] I will quit my job or not get a new job and work on &lt;OurBigBook&gt; full time for a second year to try and kickstart \b[The Higher Education Revolution]. Status: \b[~44k / 400k USD]. At \b[4M USD] I retire/tenure and work on open STEM forever. How to donate: &lt;sponsor&gt;{full}.

I first quit my job 1st June 2024 to work on the project for 1 year after I reached my initial 100k goal mostly via a &lt;sponsor/1000 Monero donation&gt;. For a second follow up year, I increased my requirement to 400k USD to give me more peace of mind as I'm destroying my career in the process. A second year greatly improve chances of success: on year one I improved my tech, on year two I want to come guns blazing to solve courses and get users.

\b[Mission]: to live in a world where you can learn &lt;university&gt;-level &lt;mathematics&gt;, &lt;physics&gt;, &lt;chemistry&gt;, &lt;biology&gt; and &lt;engineering&gt; from perfect free &lt;open source&gt; books that anyone can write to get famous. More rationale: &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt;{full}

&lt;Ciro Santilli's documentation superpowers&gt;[Explaining things is my superpower], e.g. I was top user \#39 on &lt;Stack Overflow&gt; in 2023https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/year/stackoverflow/2023-01-01{ref}&lt;Ciro Santilli's Stack Overflow contributions&gt;{ref} and I have a few 1k+ star educational &lt;GitHub&gt; repositorieshttps://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat{ref}&lt;Linux Kernel Module Cheat&gt;{ref}https://github.com/cirosantilli/x86-bare-metal-examples{ref}https://github.com/search?o=desc&amp;q=user%3Acirosantilli&amp;s=stars&amp;type=Repositories{ref}. Now I want to bring that level of awesomeness to &lt;Master's degree&gt;[masters level] &lt;Mathematics&gt; and &lt;Physics&gt;. But I can't do it alone! So I created &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt; to allow everyone to work together towards the perfect book of everything.

My life's goal is to bring hardcore &lt;university&gt;-level &lt;STEM&gt; &lt;open educational content&gt; to all ages. Sponsor me at https://github.com/sponsors/cirosantilli[] starting from 1&lt;Dollar&gt;[\$]/month so I can work full time on it. Further information: &lt;sponsor&gt;{full}. Achieving what I call "&lt;free gifted education&gt;" is my &lt;Nirvana&gt;.

Besides that, I'm also a &lt;Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China&gt;[freedom of speech] &lt;slacktivist&gt; and &lt;Ciro Santilli's cycling&gt;[recreational cyclist]. I like &lt;Chinese traditional music&gt; and classic &lt;Brazilian pop&gt;. Opinions are my own, but they could be yours too. &lt;Tax the rich&gt;.

Let's &lt;the ideal university&gt;[create an educational system] with:
* no distinction between &lt;university&gt; and &lt;high school&gt;, &lt;students must have a flexible choice of what to learn&gt;[students just go as fast as they can to what they really want] without stupid &lt;university entry exams&gt;
* &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt;[fully open source learning material]
* &lt;exam as a service&gt;[on-demand examinations that anyone can easily take without prerequisites]
* &lt;the only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories&gt;[granular entry selection only for space in specific laboratories] or participation in specific &lt;novel research&gt; projects

\b[I offer]:
* online private tutoring for:
  * any &lt;STEM&gt; university course
  * passionate younger &lt;STEM&gt; students (any age) who want to learn university level material and beyond. Can your kid be the next &lt;Fields Medalist&gt; or &lt;Nobel Prize&gt; winner? I'm here to help, especially if you are filthy rich! I focus &lt;Students must be allowed to progress as fast as they want&gt;[moving students forward as fast as they want] on and on &lt;how to teach/Projects must aim for novelty&gt;[producing useful novel tutorials and results]

  Let &lt;Emile, or On Education&gt;[your child be my Emile], and me be their &lt;Adolfo Amidei&gt;, and let's see how far they can go! I will help take your child:
  * into the best &lt;universities&gt;
  * into the best &lt;PhD&gt; programs
  and achieve their ambitious &lt;STEM&gt; goals!
* educational consulting for institutions looking to improve their &lt;STEM&gt; courses
  * do you know \i[that] course or teacher that consistently gets bad reviews every year? I'll work with the teacher to turn the problem around!
  * are you looking to create a consistent &lt;open educational resources&gt; offering to increase your institutions internationally visibility? I can help with that too.

My approach is to:
* propose interesting research projects. The starting point is always deciding the end goal: &lt;backward design&gt;{full}
* learn what is needed to do the project together with the student(s)
* publish any novel results or tutorials/tools produced &lt;freely licensed&gt; online, and encourage the student to do the same (&lt;how to teach/Let students learn by teaching&gt;{full}, &lt;digital garden&gt;)
For minors, parents are welcome to join video calls, and all interactions with the student will be recorded and made available to parents.

I have &lt;articles&gt;[a proven track of explaining complex concepts in an interesting and useful way]. I work for the learner. Teaching statement at: &lt;How to teach&gt;{full}. Pricing to be discussed. Contact details at: &lt;How to contact Ciro Santilli&gt;{full}.

I am particularly excited about pointing people to the potential &lt;next big things&gt;, my top picks these days are:
* &lt;quantum computing&gt;
* &lt;AGI research&gt;, in particular &lt;AI code generation&gt;, &lt;automated theorem proving&gt; and &lt;robotics&gt;
* assorted &lt;molecular biology technologies&gt;
I am also generally interested in:
* 20th century physics, notably &lt;AMO&gt; and &lt;condensed matter&gt;
* the &lt;history of science&gt;, and in particular &lt;there is value in tutorials written by early pioneers of the field&gt;[trying to look at seminal papers of a field]

This was a small project done by Ciro for &lt;artistic&gt; purposes that received some attention due to the incredible hype surrounding &lt;cryptocurrencies&gt; at the time. &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s views on  &lt;cryptocurrencies&gt; are summarized at: &lt;Are cryptocurrencies useful?&gt;{full}.

{description=
&lt;JPG&gt; image fully embedded in the &lt;Bitcoin blockchain&gt; depicting some kind of cut material art depicting a yellow robot, &lt;inscription (blockchain)&gt;[inscribed] on https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/4cbb32cd27b5b5edc12d3559bdffc1355ac2a210463d5cfaadc7ce9b06675b2b[January 29, 2017].

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; found this image and others during his research for &lt;Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain&gt;{full} by searching for image fingerprints on every transaction payload of the blockchain with a script.

The image was uploaded by &lt;EMBII&gt;, co-creator of the &lt;Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain/AtomSea &amp; EMBII&gt; upload mechanism, which was responsible for a large part of the image &lt;inscription (blockchain)&gt;[inscriptions] in the &lt;Bitcoin blockchain&gt;.

The associated message reads:
&gt; Chiharu \[&lt;EMBII&gt;'s Japanese wife\] and I found this little yellow robot while exploring Chicago. It will be covered by tar or eventually removed but this tribute will remain. N 41.880778 E -87.629210
This is one of &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s favorite AtomSea &amp; EMBII uploads, as it perfectly encapsules the "medium as an art form" approach to blockchain art, where even non-novel works can be recontextualized into something interesting, here depicting an opposition between the ephemeral and the immutable.

At https://twitter.com/EMBII4U/status/1615389973343268871 &lt;EMBII&gt; announced that he would be giving off shares of that image on &lt;Sup!? (Bitcoin-based social media)&gt;, a &lt;Bitcoin&gt;-backed &lt;NFT&gt; system he was; making. In December 2023, he gave some shares of the robot to &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; had some &lt;Ciro Santilli's naughty projects&gt;[naughty OSINT fun] finding some of the websites of this defunct network in 2023 after he heard about https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran/[the 2022 Reuters report on the matter], which for the first time gave away 7 concrete websites out of a claimed 885 total found.

This is another website that was used as one of the &lt;CIA 2010 covert communication websites&gt;. This website is written in &lt;Brazilian Portuguese&gt;, and therefore suggests that the &lt;CIA&gt; had assets in &lt;Brazil&gt; at the time, and thus was spying on a "fellow democracy".

Although &lt;Snowden&gt;'s revelations made it extremely obvious to the world that the USA spies upon everyone outside of the &lt;Five Eyes&gt;, including fellow democracies, it is rare to have such a direct a concrete proof of it visible live right on the &lt;Wayback Machine&gt;.

{title=&lt;Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture in two minutes by Ciro Santilli&gt;}
{description=Quick and direct explanation of the statement of the &lt;BSD conjecture&gt; for people who know basic university mathematics. This is one of the &lt;Millennium Prize Problems&gt;, and you will get a million dollars if you can solve it! This therefore falls in the &lt;Simple to state but hard to prove&gt; of &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s &lt;the beauty of mathematics&gt; aesthetics.}

{description=This is &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s hand on the &lt;Wikipedia&gt; article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Nanopore_Technologies[]. He put it there after working a bit on &lt;Oxford nanopore river bacteria&gt;{full} :-) And he would love to document more experiments like that one &lt;Videos of all key physics experiments&gt;{full}, but opportunities are extremely rare.}

A quick &lt;2D continuous AI game&gt; prototype for &lt;reinforcement learning&gt; written in &lt;Matter.js&gt;, you can view it on a separate page at https://cirosantilli.com/_raw/js/matterjs/examples.html#top-down-asdw-fixed-viewport[]. This is a for-fun-only prototype for &lt;Ciro's 2D reinforcement learning games&gt;, &lt;C++&gt; or maybe &lt;Python&gt; (for the &lt;deep learning&gt; ecosystem) seems inevitable for a serious version of such a project. But it is cute how much you can do with a few lines of &lt;Matter.js&gt;!
