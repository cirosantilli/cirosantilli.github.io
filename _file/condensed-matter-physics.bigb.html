= Condensed matter
{synonym}

&lt;Condensed matter physics&gt; is one of the best examples of &lt;emergence&gt;. We start with a bunch of small elements which we understand fully at the required level (&lt;atoms&gt;, &lt;electrons&gt;, &lt;quantum mechanics&gt;) but then there are complex properties that show up when we put a bunch of them together.

Includes fun things like:
* &lt;superconductivity&gt; and &lt;superfluidity&gt;
* &lt;semiconductors&gt;

As of 2020, this is the other "fundamental branch of physics" besides to &lt;particle physics&gt;/&lt;nuclear physics&gt;.

Condensed matter is basically &lt;chemistry&gt; but without reactions: you study a fixed state of matter, not a reaction in which compositions change with time.

Just like in chemistry, you end up getting some very well defined substance properties due to the incredibly large number of atoms.

Just like chemistry, the ultimate goal is to do de-novo &lt;computational chemistry&gt; to predict those properties.

And just like chemistry, what we can actually is actually very limited in part due to the exponential nature of &lt;quantum mechanics&gt;.

Also since chemistry involves reactions, chemistry puts a huge focus on liquids and solutions, which is the simplest state of matter to do reactions in.

Condensed matter however can put a lot more emphasis on solids than chemistry, notably because solids are what we generally want in end products, no one likes stuff leaking right?

But it also studies liquids, e.g. notably &lt;superfluidity&gt;.

One thing condensed matter is particularly obsessed with is the fascinating phenomena of &lt;phase transition&gt;.

AMO is a slightly more general area than &lt;condensed matter physics&gt;, including related phenomena with smaller numbers atoms and optics. The two terms are however sometimes used as synonyms. The term AMO has gained wide usage and acceptability, see e.g.:
* https://www.sussex.ac.uk/amo/ at &lt;University of Sussex&gt;

If Ciro had had greater foresight, &lt;when in doubt, choose the course that has the most experimental work&gt;[this might have been what he studied at university]!

{parent=Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics}
{wiki}

&lt;Molecular beams&gt; are cool because they create a one dimensional flow of &lt;molecules&gt;, which makes it easier to observe certain single-molecule effects, as it removes the multi-particle issues from experiments.

Key &lt;molecular beam&gt; experiments include:
* &lt;Stern-Gerlach experiment&gt;, which confirmed the existence of &lt;spin&gt;
* &lt;Rabi's NMR experiment&gt;, which confirmed the existence of &lt;nuclear spin&gt;

The center piece of the control system of &lt;atomic clocks&gt; is a &lt;molecular beam&gt;.

Experiments:
* "An introduction to superconductivity" by Alfred Leitner originally published in 1965, source: http://www.alfredleitner.com/
* Isotope effect on the critical temperature. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Solids/coop.html mentions that:

  &gt; If electrical conduction in mercury were purely electronic, there should be no dependence upon the nuclear masses. This dependence of the critical temperature for superconductivity upon isotopic mass was the first direct evidence for interaction between the electrons and the lattice. This supported the &lt;BCS Theory&gt; of lattice coupling of electron pairs.

  Cool CNRS video showing the condensed wave function, and mentioning that "every pair moves at the same speed". To change the speed of one pair, you need to change the speed of all others. That's why there's not energy loss.

Transition into superconductivity can be seen as a &lt;phase transition&gt;, which happens to be a &lt;second-order phase transition&gt;.

We know that &lt;superfluidity&gt; happens more easily in &lt;bosons&gt;, and so electrons joins in &lt;Cooper pairs&gt; to form &lt;bosons&gt;, making a superfluid of &lt;Cooper pairs&gt;!

As of 2023 the most important ones economicaly were:
* &lt;Nb-Ti&gt;: the most widely used one. Used e.g. to create the &lt;magnetic fields&gt; of the &lt;Large Hadron Collider&gt; Up to 15 &lt;Tesla (unit)&gt;[T].
* &lt;Nb-Sn&gt;: more expensive than &lt;Nb-Ti&gt;, but can reach up to 30 &lt;Tesla (unit)&gt;[T].
The main application is &lt;magnetic resonance imaging&gt;. Both of these are have to be &lt;Liquid helium&gt;, i.e. they are not "&lt;high-temperature superconductor&gt;" which is a pain. One big strength they have is that they are &lt;metallic&gt;, and therefore can made into wires, which is crucial to be able to make &lt;electromagnetic coils&gt; out of them.

High level concepts:
* the wave functions of pairs of electrons (fermions) get together to form bosons. This is a &lt;phase transition&gt; effect, thus the specific sudden transition temperature.
* the pairs form a &lt;Bose-Einstein condensate&gt;
* once this new state is reached, all pairs are somehow entangled into one big wave function, and you so individual lattice imperfections can't move just one single electron off trajectory and make it lose energy

&lt;Discrete&gt; &lt;quantum&gt; effect observed in &lt;superconductors&gt; with a small insulating layer, a device known as a &lt;Josephson junction&gt;.

To understand the behaviour effect, it is important to look at the &lt;Josephson equations&gt; consider the following &lt;Josephson effect regimes&gt; separately:
* &lt;DC Josephson effect&gt;
* &lt;AC Josephson effect&gt;
* &lt;Inverse AC Josephson effect&gt;

A good summary from Wikipedia by physicist Andrew Whitaker:
&gt; at a junction of two superconductors, a current will flow even if there is no drop in voltage; that when there is a voltage drop, the current should oscillate at a frequency related to the drop in voltage; and that there is a dependence on any magnetic field

In 1962 &lt;Brian Josephson&gt; published his inaugural paper predicting the effect as &lt;Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling&gt;{full}.

In 1963 &lt;Philip W. Anderson&gt; and &lt;John M. Rowell&gt; published their paper that first observed the effect as &lt;Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling&gt;{full}.

Some golden notes can be found at &lt;True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen&gt; page 224 and around. &lt;Philip W. Anderson&gt; commented:
&gt; We were all - &lt;Brian Josephson&gt;[Josephson], Pippard and myself, as well as various other people who also habitually sat at the &lt;Mond Laboratory&gt;[Mond] tea and participated in the discussions of the next few weeks - very much puzzled by the meaning of the fact that the &lt;electric current&gt;[current] depends on the &lt;Josephson phase&gt;[phase]

As part of the course Anderson had introduced the concept of broken symmetry in superconductors. Josephson "was fascinated by the idea of broken symmetry, and wondered whether there could be any way of observing it experimentally."

This is what happens when you apply a &lt;DC voltage&gt; across a &lt;Josephson junction&gt;.

It is called "AC effect" because when we apply a &lt;DC voltage&gt;, it produces an &lt;alternating current&gt; on the device.

By looking at the &lt;Josephson equations&gt;, we see that $V(t) = k$ a positive constant, then $\varphi$ just increases linearly without bound.

Therefore, from the first equation:

I(t) = I_c \sin (\varphi (t))
$$
we see that the current will just vary sinusoidally between $\pm I_c$.

This meas that we can use a &lt;Josephson junction&gt; as a perfect voltage to frequency converter.

Wikipedia mentions that this frequency is $484 GHz/mV$, so it is very very high, so we are not able to view individual points of the sine curve separately with our instruments.

Also it is likely not going to be very useful for many practical applications in this mode.

An &lt;I-V curve&gt; can also be seen at: &lt;image Electron microscope image of a Josephson junction its I-V curve&gt;.

{description=
Voltage is horizontal, current vertical. The vertical bar in the middle is the effect of interest: the current is going up and down very quickly between $\pm I_c$, the &lt;Josephson current&gt; of the device. Because it is too quick for the &lt;oscilloscope&gt;, we just see a solid vertical bar.

The non vertical curves at right and left are just other effects we are not interested in.

TODO what does it mean that there is no line at all near the central vertical line? What happens at those voltages?

{parent=Josephson effect regime}
{wiki=Josephson_effect\#The_inverse_AC_Josephson_effect}

If you shine &lt;microwave&gt; radiation on a Josephson junction, it produces a fixed average voltage that depends only on the frequency of the microwave. TODO how is that done more precisely? How to you produce and inject microwaves into the thing?

It acts therefore as a perfect frequency to voltage converter.

The Wiki page gives the formula: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect#The_inverse_AC_Josephson_effect You get several sinusoidal harmonics, so the output is not a perfect sine. But the infinite sum of the harmonics has a fixed average voltage value.

And https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_voltage_standard#Josephson_effect mentions that the effect is independent of the junction material, physical dimension or temperature.

All of the above, compounded with the fact that we are able to generate microwaves with extremely precise frequency with an &lt;atomic clock&gt;, makes this phenomenon perfect as a &lt;Volt&gt; standard, the &lt;Josephson voltage standard&gt;.

TODO understand how/why it works better.

{c}
{parent=Josephson effect}
{wiki}

Two equations derived &lt;from first principles&gt; by &lt;Brian Josephson&gt; that characterize the device, somewhat like an &lt;I-V curve&gt;:
$$
I(t) = I_c \sin (\varphi (t)) \\
\dv{\varphi(t)}{t} = \frac{2 e V(t)}{\hbar}
$$
where:
* $I_c$: &lt;Josephson current&gt;
* $\varphi$: the &lt;Josephson phase&gt;, a function $\R \to \R$ defined by the second equation plus initial conditions
* $V(t)$: input voltage of the system
* $I(t)$: current across the junction, determined by the input voltage

Note how these equations are not a typical &lt;I-V curve&gt;, as they are not an instantaneous dependency between voltage and current: the history of the voltage matters! Or in other words, the system has an internal state, represented by the &lt;Josephson phase&gt; at a given point in time.

To understand them better, it is important to look at some important cases separately:
* &lt;AC Josephson effect&gt;: V is a fixed &lt;DC voltage&gt;

The first published experimental observation of the &lt;magnetic flux quantum&gt;.

The paper that follows it in the journal is also of interest, "Theoretical Considerations Concerning Quantized Magnetic Flux In Superconducting Cylinders" by N. Byers and C. N. Yang, it starts:
&gt; In a recent experiment, the magnetic flux through a superconducting ring has been found to be quantized in units of ch/2e. Quantization in twice this unit has been briefly discussed by London' and by Onsager. ' Onsager' has also considered the possibility of quantization in units ch/2e due to pairs of electrons forming quasi-bosons.
So there was some previous confusion about the flux quantum due to the presence of &lt;Cooper pairs&gt; or not.

He then measures the &lt;I-V curve&gt; on an &lt;Agilent Technologies oscilloscope&gt;.

To understand the graph, first learn/remember the difference between the &lt;magnetic B and H field&gt;.

The interest of the &lt;magnetic hysteresis&gt; graph is that it serves as an important characterization of a :
* its area gives you the hysteresis loss of the &lt;transformer&gt;, which is a major cause of efficiency loss of the component
* some key points of the curve give important characterizations of the core/material:
  * &lt;Saturation magnetisation&gt;
  * magnetization strength without field
  * how much field you need to demagnetize it
This curve will also tell you how many turns of the coil will be needed to reach the required field.

&lt;Electromagnets&gt; allow us to create controllable &lt;magnetic fields&gt;, i.e.: they act as &lt;magnets&gt; that we can turn on and off as we please but controlling an input &lt;voltage&gt;.

Compare them to &lt;permanent magnet&gt;: on a magnet, you always have a fixed generated magnetic field. But with an &lt;electromagnet&gt; you can control the field, and even turn it off entirely.

This type of "useful looking thing that can be controlled by a voltage" tends to be of huge importance in &lt;electrical engineering&gt;, the &lt;transistor&gt; being another example.

&lt;Solenoids&gt; are a type of &lt;electromagnet coil&gt; of #helical shape.

Solenoids are simpler to build as they don't require &lt;#insulated wire&gt; as in modern &lt;electrical cable&gt; because as the &lt;electromagnetic coils&gt; don't touch one another.

As such it is perhaps the reason why some early electromagnetism experiments were carried out with solenoids, which &lt;#André-Marie Ampère&gt; named in 1823.

But the downside of this is that the &lt;magnetic field&gt; they can generate is less strong.

* the spins direction (up or down) of atoms in a &lt;magnet&gt;, which can undergo phase transitions depending on temperature as that characterized by the &lt;Curie temperature&gt; and an externally applied magnetic field

  Neighboring spins like to align, which lowers the total system energy.
* the type of atom at a lattice point in a 2-metal &lt;alloy&gt;, e.g. &lt;Fe-C&gt; (e.g. &lt;steel&gt;). TODO: intuition for the neighbor interaction? What likes to be with what? And aren't different phases in different crystal structures?

Also has some funky relations to &lt;renormalization&gt; TODO.

A tiny idealized magnet! It is a very good model if you have a small strong magnet interacting with objects that are far away, notably other &lt;magnetic dipoles&gt; or a constant magnetic field.

The cool thing about this model is that we have simple explicit formulas for the &lt;magnetic field&gt; it produces, and for how this little magnet is affected by a magnetic field or by another &lt;magnetic dipole&gt;.

This is the perfect model for &lt;electron&gt; &lt;spin&gt;, but it can also be representative of macroscopic systems in the right circumstances.

The intuition for the name is likely that "dipole" means "both poles are on the same spot".

Applications: produce high &lt;magnetic fields&gt; for

* more researchy applications as of the early 2020s:
  * &lt;magnetic confinement fusion&gt;
  * &lt;particle accelerators&gt;
As of the early 2020s, &lt;superconducting magnets&gt; predominantly use low temperature superconductors &lt;Nb-Ti&gt; and &lt;Nb-Sn&gt;, see also &lt;most important superconductor materials&gt;, but there were efforts underway to create practical &lt;high-temperature superconductor&gt;-based magnets as well: &lt;high temperature superconductor superconducting magnet&gt;{full}.

Wikipedia has done well for once:
&gt; The current to the coil windings is provided by a high current, very low voltage &lt;DC source&gt;[DC power supply], since in steady state the only voltage across the magnet is due to the resistance of the feeder wires. Any change to the current through the magnet must be done very slowly, first because electrically the magnet is a large inductor and an abrupt current change will result in a large voltage spike across the windings, and more importantly because fast changes in current can cause eddy currents and mechanical stresses in the windings that can precipitate a quench (see below). So the power supply is usually &lt;microprocessor&gt;-controlled, programmed to accomplish current changes gradually, in gentle ramps. It usually takes several minutes to energize or de-energize a laboratory-sized magnet.

Used to explain the &lt;black-body radiation experiment&gt;.

Published as: &lt;On the Theory of the Energy Distribution Law of the Normal Spectrum by Max Planck (1900)&gt;.

&lt;The Quantum Story by Jim Baggott (2011)&gt; page 9 mentions that Planck apparently immediately recognized that &lt;Planck constant&gt; was a new fundamental &lt;physical constant&gt;, and could have potential applications in the definition of the &lt;system of units&gt; (TODO where was that published):
&gt; &lt;Planck&gt; wrote that the constants offered: 'the possibility of establishing units of length, mass, time and temperature which are independent of speciﬁc bodies or materials and which necessarily maintain their meaning for all time and for all civilizations, even those which are extraterrestrial and nonhuman, constants which therefore can be called "fundamental physical units of measurement".'
This was a visionary insight, and was finally realized in the &lt;2019 redefinition of the SI base units&gt;.

TODO how can it be derived from theoretical principles alone? There is one derivation at; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law#Derivation but it does not seem to mention the &lt;Schrödinger equation&gt; at all.

  and the footnote comments:
  &gt; The study of cavity radiation was not just about establishing theoretical principles, however. It was also of interest to the German Bureau of Standards as a reference for rating electric lamps.
* 1859-60 Gustav Kirchhoff demonstrated that the ratio of emitted to absorbed energy depends only on the frequency of the radiation and the temperature inside the cavity

* 1900 expriments by Otto Lummer and Ernst Pringsheim show &lt;Wien approximation&gt; is bad for lower frequencies
* 1900-10-07 Heinrich Rubens visits Planck in Planck's villa in the Berlin suburb of Grünewald and informs him about new experimental he and Ferdinand Kurlbaum obtained, still showing that &lt;Wien approximation&gt; is bad
* 1900 &lt;Planck's law&gt; matches Lummer and Pringsheim's experiments well. Planck forced to make the "desperate" postulate that energy is exchanged in quantized lumps. Not clear that light itself is quantized however, he thinks it might be something to do with allowed vibration modes of the atoms of the cavity rather.

= Lasers vs other light sources
{parent=Laser}

The key advantages of lasers over other &lt;light sources&gt; are:
* &lt;lasers emit a narrow spectrum&gt;
* it can be efficient collimated, while still emitting a lot of output power: &lt;Why can't you collimate incoherent light as well as a laser?&gt;{full}
* can be phase and polarization coherent, though it is not always the case? TODO.

One cool thing about &lt;lasers&gt; is that they rely on one specific atomic energy level transition to produce light. This is why they are able to to be so monchromatic. Compare this to:
* incandescent bulbs: wide &lt;black-body radiation&gt; spectrum
* &lt;LED&gt;: has a wider spectrum fundamentally related to an energy distribution, related: &lt;Why aren't LEDs monochromatic&gt;
* TODO think a bit about &lt;fluorescent lamps&gt;. These also rely on atomic energy transitions, but many of them are present at once, which makes the spectrum very noisy. But would individual lines be very narrow?
As such, lasers manage to largely overcome "temperature distribution-like" effects that create wider wave spectrum

It emits a very narrow range of frequencies (small linewidth), which for many purposes can be considered a single frequency.

It does however have a small range of frequencies. The smaller the range, the better the laser quality.

https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/252393/why-cant-incoherent-light-be-collimated-as-well-as-laser-light-e-g-in-a-laser

You could put an &lt;LED&gt; in a cavity with a thin long hole but then, most rays, which are not aligned with the hole, will just bounce inside forever producing heat.

So you would have a very hot device, and very little efficiency on the light output. This heat might also behave like a &lt;black-body radiation&gt; source, so you would not have a single frequency.

The beauty of lasers is the laser cavity (two parallel mirrors around the medium) selects parallel motion preferentially, see e.g.: https://youtu.be/_JOchLyNO_w?t=832 from &lt;video How Lasers Work by Scientized (2017)&gt;

This is by far the most important type of &lt;laser&gt; commercially, as it can be made relatively cheaply, and it doesn't break easily as it ends up being a single &lt;crystal&gt;.

Compare them for example to the earlier &lt;gas lasers&gt;.

This is the type of laser that you would get in a simple &lt;laser pointer&gt;.

But the real mega aplications are:
* &lt;fiber-optic communication&gt;, where &lt;laser diodes&gt; are one of the most commonly used methods to generate the light that goes in the fiber. This makes &lt;laser diodes&gt; one of the most important inventions of the 20th centure without doubt.
* &lt;optical storage&gt;. But as of the 2020s its usefulness was much diminished by a combination of &lt;solid-state storage&gt; + faster &lt;Internet&gt; due largely to &lt;fiber-optic communication&gt;. So it is partly a matter of &lt;laser diodes&gt; beating &lt;laser diodes&gt;!

  If some &lt;alien&gt; race had even less energy, they might not know about &lt;electrons&gt; at all, and could think that &lt;anyons&gt; are actually elementary.

  Being an "elementary particle" is always a possibly temporary label.
