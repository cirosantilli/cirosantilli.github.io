&lt;The Eighth Day of Creation&gt; has a related quote:
&gt; In a conversation a few weeks earlier at the faculty club of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a couple of biologists had speculated whether &lt;Pauling&gt;, whose recent popular book on the benefits to health and sanity of massive doses of vitamin C was stacked in display near the entrance of the &lt;MIT&gt;[M.I.T.] bookstore, was showing signs of what one of the men called "old scientist's disease" - which they defined as what happens to great men when they grow beyond the psychological reach of the salutary system by which scientists blow the whistle on one another's mistakes.

Understand and explain amazingly every single &lt;Nobel Prize&gt; in &lt;physics&gt;, &lt;chemistry&gt; and &lt;biology&gt;. Since in particular the &lt;Nobel Foundation&gt; is unable to do that for any at all, especially of the key old ones, e.g. https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/summary/[]. Hopeless.

To be fair, those in theoretical physics at least basically come down to reading a bunch of books. But perhaps anything slightly more experimental could have
