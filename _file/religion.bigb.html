&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; is &lt;agnostic&gt;, see also: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/tree/965430af9f50a93ac23dfbb72719eee0f93c8c5c#do-you-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong

His father always told him a story about how when Ciro was small, someone raised the question of the existence of &lt;God&gt;, to which Ciro replied very directly and naturally, without any doubts:
&gt; That doesn't exist.
It's a genetic thing it seems.

It is just mind blowing that &lt;Christians&gt;, &lt;Muslims&gt; and &lt;Jews&gt; can have so many conflicts considering that their religions are basically the same. &lt;Uncanny valley&gt; comes to mind. See also remarks at: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/zhong-gong

The &lt;transfiguration of Jesus&gt; is a notable example where &lt;Jesus&gt;/the Church tries to divert older religions into him. And then &lt;Muhammad&gt; does the same during &lt;isra and Mi'raj&gt;, and meets up with &lt;Jesus&gt;, &lt;John the Baptist&gt; and &lt;Abraham&gt;. The &lt;Kaaba&gt; was also clearly an earlier place of worship of local religions before &lt;Muhammad&gt;. But of course, &lt;Abraham&gt; was one of the builders of the &lt;Kaaba&gt;, so all good.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s favorite religion. He does not believe fully in it, nor has he studied it besides through brief Wikipedia and &lt;Googling&gt;.

Ciro likes Buddhism because it feels like the least "metaphysical explanations to things you can't see" of the religions he knows.

Rather, it feels more like "a plausible theory of the mind" and &lt;physics and the illusion of life&gt;[highly compatible with physics].

Ciro also believes that there is a positive correlation between being a &lt;software engineer&gt; and liking &lt;Buddhism&gt;[Buddhist-like things], see also: &lt;the correlation between software engineers and Buddhism&gt;.

While listening to endless hours of &lt;vaporwave&gt; while coding, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; spotted some amazing Buddhist-like voice samples, and eventually found that they were by Allan Watts.

&lt;Self-help&gt;? Maybe. &lt;Cult leader&gt;? Maybe. But at least it is one that Ciro buys into.

Is there &lt;a correlation between software engineers and Buddhism&gt; and liking the dude? Because this exists: https://wattsalan.github.io

Perhaps the appeal of Zen is that it stepped away from &lt;Mahayana&gt;'s "God and entities", and went a bit back towards the Buddhist &lt;psychology&gt;-like/self improvement grassroots?

Theses places give out free food all the time.

The first time &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; went to one was when an &lt;Indian&gt; friend of his took him to the one in the North of &lt;Paris&gt; when they were &lt;Ciro Santilli's biography&gt;[living there in the first half of the 2010's], the Gurdwara Singh Sabha France.

Much like &lt;Islam&gt;'s &lt;Ramadan&gt;, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; appreciates this a lot due to due to &lt;Ciro Santilli's self perceived compassionate personality&gt; and &lt;Ciro Santilli's cheapness&gt;.

Instead of just talking, those people really go out, and put food on the plate for anyone who needs it (or even for those that don't really need it! Although who would be so souless to eat for free and not donate a few bucks if they can afford to???). There's a beauty to that.

Writing this also remembered Ciro of non-religious groups that would give out free food to the poor at

Chapter 2 paragraph 14:
&gt; Formerly, I, Zhuang Zhou, dreamt that I was a butterfly, a butterfly flying about, feeling that it was enjoying itself. I did not know that it was Zhou. Suddenly I awoke, and was myself again, the veritable Zhou. I did not know whether it had formerly been Zhou dreaming that he was a butterfly, or it was now a butterfly dreaming that it was Zhou. But between Zhou and a butterfly there must be a difference. This is a case of what is called the Transformation of Things.'
