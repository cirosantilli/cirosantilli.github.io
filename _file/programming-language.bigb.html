{wiki}

A language that allows you to talk to and command a &lt;computer&gt;.

There is only space for two languages at most in the world: the &lt;compiled programming language&gt;[compiled] one, and the &lt;interpreted programming language&gt;[interpreted] one.

For 2020 now, when you have a choice, you must go for:
* &lt;Python&gt; as the interpreted one
* &lt;C++&gt; for compiled

Those two are languages not by any means perfect from a language design point of view, and there are likely already better alternatives, they are only chosen due to a pragmatic tradeoff between ecosystem and familiarity.

Ciro predicts that Python will become like &lt;Fortran&gt; in the future: a legacy hated by most who have moved to &lt;JavaScript&gt; long ago (which is slightly inferior, but too similar, and with too much web dominance to be replaced), but with too much dominance in certain applications like machine learning to be worth replacing, like Fortran dominates certain HPC applications. We'll see. Maybe non performance critical scripting languages are easier to replace.

&lt;C++&gt; however is decent, and is evolving in very good directions in the 2010's, and will remain relevant in the foreseeable future.

&lt;Bash&gt; can also be used when you're lazy. But if the project goes on, you will sooner or later regret that choice.

The language syntax in itself does not matter. All that matters is how many useful libraries and tooling it has.

This is how other languages compare:
* &lt;C (programming language)&gt;[C]: but cannot make a large codebase &lt;DRY&gt; without insanity
* &lt;Ruby (programming language)&gt;[Ruby]: the exact same as Python, and only strong in one domain: &lt;web development&gt;, while Python rules everything else, and is not bad on web either. So just kill Ruby, please.
* &lt;JavaScript&gt;: it is totally fine if &lt;Node.js&gt; destroys &lt;Python&gt; and becomes the ONE scripting language to rule them all since Python and JavaScript are almost equally crappy (although JavaScript is a bit more of course).

  One thing must be said tough: `someobject.not_defined_property` silently returning `undefined` rather than blowing up is &lt;bullshit&gt;.
* &lt;Go (language)&gt;: likely a good replacement for &lt;Python&gt;. If the ecosystem gets there, will gladly use it more.
* &lt;Java&gt;: good language, but has an ugly enterprisey ecosystem, Oracle has made/kept the development process too closed, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_v._Oracle_America[API patenting madness on Android just kills if off completely]
* &lt;Haskell&gt;: many have tried to learn some functional stuff, but too hard. Sounds really cool though.
* Rust: sounds cool, you will gladly replace C and C++ with it if the ecosystem ramps up.
* &lt;C&gt;: &lt;Microsoft&gt; is &lt;evil&gt;
* &lt;Tcl&gt;, &lt;Perl (programming language)&gt;: Python killed them way back and is less insane
* &lt;R (programming language)&gt;[R], GNU Octave and any other "&lt;numerical computing language&gt;": all of this is a waste of society's time as explained at: &lt;numerical computing language&gt;{full}
* Swift: Ciro would rather stay away from &lt;Apple&gt; dominated projects if possible since they sell a &lt;closed source&gt; &lt;operating system&gt;

&lt;Good&gt; because &lt;unnecessary state is the source of much evil&gt;.

Even if we cannot do everything in functional, we should at least strive to clearly extract functional substes in what we do.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; thinks &lt;imperative programming&gt; is just a superset of &lt;functional programming&gt; where you can have state.

&lt;C (programming language)&gt; and &lt;C++&gt;: OK, you're old before the Internet and compiled, forgiven.

&lt;Python&gt;: OMG, please, just make it work!!! Your are interpreted!!! You are a hot web technology!!! &lt;Node.js&gt; and &lt;Ruby (programming language)&gt; are doing just fine, and Ruby is not newer than you!!! See also: &lt;pip (package manager)&gt;.

Interestingly, the very first programming language with an actual implementation was interpreted: &lt;Short Code (programming-language)&gt; in 1950.

This is not surprising, as interpreters are easier to write than compilers.

And just like modern scripting languages, it reduced execution speed by about 50x.

The &lt;for loop&gt; is a subcase of the &lt;while loop&gt;.

One theoretical motivation for its existence is that it has the fundamental property that we are immediately certain it will terminate, unlike &lt;while loops&gt; with arbitrary conditions.

&lt;Primitive recursive functions&gt; are the &lt;complexity&gt; class that divides those two.

It gets the job done, but cannot make a large codebase DRY without insanity.

As of 2020, C is like &lt;Latin&gt;, and we are in the &lt;Middle Ages&gt;, where it has become a &lt;lingua franca&gt;.

It is interesting to note how late C appeared: 1972, compared e.g. to &lt;Fortran&gt; which is from 1957. This is basically because C was a "systems programming language", i.e. with focus on pointer manipulation, and because early computers were so weak, there was no operating system or many software layers in the early days. Fortran however was a numerical language, and it ran directly on bare metal, an application that existed before systems programming.

Java is good.

Its boilerplate requirement is a pain, but the design is otherwise very clean.

But its ecosystem sucks.

The development process is rather closed, the issue tracker obscure.

And above all, &lt;Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.&gt; killed everybody's trust in it once and for all. Thanks &lt;Oracle&gt;.

The language all browsers converted to as of 2019, and therefore the easiest one to distribute and most widely implemented programming language.

Hopefully will be killed by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly[WebAssembly] one day.

Because JavaScript is a relatively crap/ad-hoc language, it ended up some decent tooling to make up for that, e.g. stuff like linting via ESLint and reformatting through Prettier is much more widespread than in other languages.

JavaScript data structure are also quite a bit anemic, which makes libraries such as lodash incredibly popular. But most of that stuff should be in the stdlib.

Our JavaScript examples can be found at:
* &lt;Node.js example&gt;: examples that don't interact with any browser feature. We are just testing those on the CLI which is much more convenient.
* &lt;JavaScript browser example&gt;: examples that interact with browser-specific features, notably the DOM

{disambiguate=JavaScript}
{parent=JavaScript language}

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function

`async` is all present in &lt;JavaScript&gt; for two reasons:
* you make network requests all the time
* JavaScript is single threaded, so if you are waiting for a network request, the UI freezes, see remarks on the deprecation of synchronous HTTP request at: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests

However, it is also &lt;Hell&gt;: &lt;how to convert async to sync in JavaScript&gt;.

= How to convert `async` to sync in JavaScript
{parent=async (JavaScript)}

&lt;God&gt;, it's impossible! You just have to convert the entire fucking call stack all the way up to async functions. It could mean refactoring hundreds of functions.

To be fair, there is a logic to this, if you put yourself within the crappiness of the &lt;JavaScript&gt; threading model. And &lt;Python&gt; is not that much better with its &lt;Global Interpreter Lock&gt;.

The problem is that async was introduced relatively late, previously we just had to use infinitely deep callback &lt;tree (data structure)&gt;[trees], which was worse:
``
myAsync().then(ret =&gt; myAsync2(ret).then(ret2 =&gt; myAsync3(re3)))
``
compared to the new infinitely more readable:
``
ret = await myAsync()
ret2 = await myAsync2(ret)
ret3 = await myAsync3(ret3)
``
But now we are in an endless period of transition between both worlds.

It is also worth mentioning that callbacks are still inescapable if you really want to fan out into a non-linear dependency graph, usually with `Promise.all`:
``
await Promise.all([
  myAsync(1).then(ret =&gt; myAsync2(ret)),
  myAsync(2).then(ret =&gt; myAsync2(ret)),
])
``

And then, after many many hours of this work, you might notice that the new code is way, way way slower than before, because making small functions `async` has a large performance impact: https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/javascript-promise-overhead/[]. Real world case with a 4x slowdown: https://github.com/ourbigbook/ourbigbook/tree/async-slow[].

Anyways, since you Googled here, you might as well learn the standard pattern to convert callbacks functions into async functions using a promise: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4708787/get-password-from-input-using-node-js/71868483#71868483

&lt;Ciro Santilli's wife&gt; was studying a bit of basic Python for some job interviews, when she noticed:
&gt; Wow, `in` is so powerful! You can do `for x in list`, `for x in dict` and `if x in dict` all with that single word!
Damn right, girl, damn right.

Ciro remembers hearing about &lt;Python&gt; online briefly. It seemed like a distant thing from the &lt;Java&gt;/&lt;C (programming language)&gt; dominated (and outdated) university courses. Then some teaching assistant mentioned during some course when Ciro was at &lt;École Polytechnique&gt; that Python was a great integration tool. That sounded cool.

Then finally, &lt;when the École Polytechnique mathematics department didn't let Ciro Santilli do his internship of choice due to grades&gt; and Ciro was at an useless last moment backup internship, he learned more Python instead of doing his internship job, and was hooked.

= CPython JIT
{c}
{parent=CPython}

Added in &lt;CPython 3.13&gt;.

To enable tested on &lt;Ubuntu 25.04&gt;:
``
git clone https://github.com/python/cpython
cd cpython
git checkout v3.13.7
./configure --enable-experimental-jit
make -j
``

However, the JIT appears to be useless tested as of this Python version, lol:
* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44476023
* https://devclass.com/2025/07/09/despite-30-months-work-core-developer-says-pythons-jit-compiler-is-often-slower-than-the-interpreter/
* https://fidget-spinner.github.io/posts/jit-reflections.html

We can try to test it with \a[python/inc_loop.py]:
``
time ./python python/inc_loop.py 10000000
``
but the result is just as pathetic as without JIT currently, taking about 1 second for only 10m loops.

This can be compared with the optimal assembly from \a[c/inc_loop_asm.c]:
``
time ./inc_loop_asm.out 1000000000
``
which does 1 billion loops in about half a second on &lt;Ciro Santilli's hardware/P14s&gt;.

For comparison, &lt;PyPy&gt; actually speeds things up and does 1 billion loops in about a second, so only 2x worse than native.

TODO triple check that JIT is enabled. Many threads say the command is:
``
./python -c 'import sysconfig; sysconfig.get_config_var("JIT_DEPS")'
``
but that fails with:
``
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_sysconfigdata__linux_x86_64-linux-gnu'
``

For comparison with a properly implemented dynamic language JIT running \a[nodejs/inc_loop.js] does 1 billion loops in 0.6s on v22.14.0, close to native.

https://tonybaloney.github.io/posts/python-gets-a-jit.html documents what the initial "JIT" implementation does. It is just an extremely naive concatenation of instructions that avoids a for + switch. No wonder it doesn't speed things up much at all.

{wiki}

Conda is like &lt;pip&gt;, except that it also manages shared library dependencies, including providing prebuilts.

This has made &lt;Conda&gt; very popular in the &lt;deep learning&gt; community around 2020, where using Python frontends like &lt;PyTorch&gt; to configure faster precompiled backends was extremely common.

It also means that it is a full package manager and extremely overbloated and blows up all the time. People should just use &lt;Docker&gt; instead for that kind of stuff: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/kd88p8/comment/keco07k/

You also have to buy a license to use their repos if you are part of a large-enough organization: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74762863/are-conda-miniconda-and-anaconda-free-to-use-and-open-source

= Install Conda on Ubuntu
{parent=Conda}
{wiki}

Tested on &lt;Ubuntu 20.04&gt;:
``
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
``
Add to your `.bashrc`:
``
PATH="$PATH:$HOME/miniconda3/bin"
``
and then to use it on a shell e.g. with Python 3.9 create the environment with:
``
conda create -y -n mytest3.9 python=3.9
``
and then use it with:
``
eval "$(command conda 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2&gt; /dev/null)"
conda activate mytest3.9
``
Now you can use `python` and `pip` normally from inside that `mytest3.9` environment.

At that time, the exact installer under `latest` appears to have been: https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py311_23.11.0-2-Linux-x86_64.sh

With our understanding of the &lt;discrete Fourier transform&gt; we see clearly that:
* the signal is being decomposed into &lt;sinusoidal&gt; components
* because we are doing the &lt;Discrete Fourier transform of a real signal&gt;, for the `fft`, $X_k = \conj{X_{N-k}}$ so there is redundancy in the. We also understand that `rfft` simply cuts off and only keeps half of the coefficients

The only reason why &lt;Ruby (programming language)&gt; exists.

This web framework is pretty good as of 2020 compared to others, because it managed to gain a critical community size, and there's a lot of basic setup already done for you.

it is just big shame it wasn't written in &lt;Python&gt; or even better, &lt;Node.js&gt;, because learning &lt;Ruby (programming language)&gt; is completely useless for anything else. As of 2020 for example, most &lt;Node.js&gt; web frameworks feel like crap compared to Rails, you just have to debug so much there.

Used in &lt;GitLab&gt;, which is why &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; touched it.
