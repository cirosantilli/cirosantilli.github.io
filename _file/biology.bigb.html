A cool thought: &lt;bacteria&gt; like &lt;E. Coli&gt; replicate every 20 minutes. A human replicates every 15 years. So how can &lt;multicellular&gt; beings possibly cope with the speed of evolution of parasites?

The answer is that within us, the &lt;adaptive immune system&gt; is a population of cells that &lt;evolves&gt; very quickly. So in a sense, within our bodies there is fast cell-level non-inheritable evolution happening daily!

Each of the omics studies a subset of &lt;molecular biology&gt; with a data intensive and broad point of view that tries to understand global function or organisms, trying to understand what every biologically relevant &lt;molecule&gt; does as part of the hole &lt;metabolism&gt;.

The main omics are:
* &lt;proteomics&gt;
* &lt;metabolomics&gt;

&lt;Omics&gt; might be &lt;stamp collecting&gt;, but maybe it is a bit more like &lt;Trading card game&gt;/&lt;Magic: The Gathering&gt; collecting, in which the cards that you are collecting actually have specific uses and interactions, especially considering that most &lt;metabolic pathways&gt; are analogous across many &lt;species&gt;.

{wiki}

Sequence alignment is trying to match a &lt;DNA&gt; or &lt;amino acid&gt; sequence, even though the sequences might not be exactly the same, otherwise it would be a straight up &lt;string-search algorithm&gt;.

This is fundamental in &lt;bioinformatics&gt; for two reasons:
* when you &lt;sequence the DNA&gt; of a new &lt;species&gt;, you can guess what each &lt;protein&gt; does by comparing it with similar proteins in other species that you have already studied
* when doing &lt;DNA sequencing&gt;, and specially &lt;short-read DNA sequencing&gt;, you generally need to align the reads to reference genomes to know where you are inside the entire genome, and then be able to spot &lt;mutations&gt;, notably &lt;single-nucleotide polymorphisms&gt;

BLAST is a &lt;sequence alignment&gt;.

The &lt;NCBI&gt; free-to-use BLAST server: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi[]. Having a centralized query server is fundamental, because the gain of &lt;sequence alignment&gt; really comes from having one huge database to link information together, which is best centralized.

There is great interest in this direction of research however quite clearly.

Unknown real developer name, claims to be from &lt;Canada&gt; on YouTube channel about: https://www.youtube.com/@TheBibitesDigitalLife/about[], likely because he's a software developer and wants to keep his employer's claws away from his side project.

Appears to be &lt;closed source&gt; unfortunately, so not suitable for research.

&lt;video What will happen after 100h of evolution? by The Bibites (2022)&gt; mentions it was started five years ago, so circa 2017.

Appears to be &lt;Unity&gt;-based, if you download and extract for &lt;Linux&gt; you get files named `UnityPlayer.so`.

Author is named Leo Caussan in game credits at startup: https://www.linkedin.com/in/l%C3%A9o-caussan-560350136/[], a &lt;Canadian&gt; &lt;software engineer&gt;.

Was not very &lt;Linux&gt; compatible: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBibites/comments/vqk6ac/program_stalls_at_a_blue_screen/ Trying to run 0.5.0 leads to a blank screen after you click "start simulation".

This channel contains several 2D continuous simulations and explains AI techniques used.

The engine appears to be &lt;open source&gt;: https://github.com/Primer-Learning/PrimerTools (previously at: https://github.com/Helpsypoo/primer[]). Models are closed source however.

They have several interesting multiagent game ideas.

Claims &lt;Unity&gt;-based, so has the downside of relying on a non-&lt;FOSS&gt; engine.

Ciro became mildly jealous of this channel when he found out about it, because at 800k subscribers at the time, the creator is likely able to make a living off of it, something which Ciro thought impossible.

As of 2022 he was at 1.6M followers with only 17 videos! Of course, much of those videos is about the software and they require infinite development hours to video time ratios.

Much of this success hinges a large part on the amazing 3D game presentation.

Well done!

Created by &lt;Justin Helps&gt;. Awesome name.

To make things better, the generically named channel is also the title of one of the best films of al time: &lt;Primer (2004)&gt;.

Creator of &lt;Primer (YouTube channel)&gt;

https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Primer gives real identity:
* the name is Justin Helps from &lt;Minnesota&gt;
* dropped out of his PhD that got boring, and used to work at &lt;Khan Academy&gt;
* LinkedIn gives PhD subject: https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-helps/ as &lt;materials science&gt;
* https://twitter.com/helpsypoo personal &lt;Twitter&gt; account
Feels exactly the background you'd expect: &lt;education is broken&gt;[disilusioned by the educational system], and working to make education better! Great guy! Reminds &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; of himself a bit.

{parent=Sexual reproduction}

It is not obvious why there have to be two sexes.

&lt;Sex&gt; itself is obvious: by mixing genes we increase variability.

But having two sexes rather than just being able to reproduce with anyone reduces the possible mating pool by half!

  When he is young and his &lt;blood&gt; and &lt;energy&gt; are not yet settled, he is cautious about &lt;sex&gt;.

  When he is in his prime and his &lt;blood&gt; and &lt;energy&gt; have newly achieved strength, he is cautious about combativeness.

  When he is old and his &lt;blood&gt; and &lt;energy&gt; are declining, he is cautious about acquisitiveness.

= Legalization of drugs
{synonym}

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; supports full legalization of all drugs, because he feels that it would be better overall for the world to have cheaper drugs and more &lt;drug addicts&gt;, but way, way less &lt;organized crime&gt;.

These should be extremely controlled of course, with extremely high &lt;taxes&gt; that puts their price just below the current illegal market, and a complete ban on any positive &lt;advertising&gt;.

Ciro believes that maybe the &lt;government&gt; could even go as far as giving free drugs to &lt;drug addicts&gt; so they don't have to &lt;theft&gt;[rob] to get a fix.

This is notably considering that drug-led organized crime completely dominates and corrupts the &lt;politics&gt; of many production and trafficking zones, which are already generally poor &lt;fucked&gt; up places to start with:
* &lt;Mexican drug war&gt;
* &lt;Golden Crescent&gt;
* &lt;Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)&gt;
Ciro's experiences in Brazil such as mentioned at &lt;São Remo, the favela next to USP&gt;, although much less extreme than the above, also come to mind.

Drug traffic corrupts everything. It prevents development of honest people. It is a &lt;cancer&gt;, which we have failed time and time a gain to cure. The only cure is to accept the other less insidious of addiction.

Bibliography:
* &lt;How to Fix a Drug Scandal (2020)&gt; gives a good sense of the relentlessness of the drug war, and how it affects people who are already poor the most
