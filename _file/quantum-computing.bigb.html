Quantum is getting hot in 2019, and even &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; got a bit excited: &lt;quantum computing could be the next big thing&gt;.

No useful algorithm has been economically accelerated by quantum yet as of 2019, only &lt;quantum supremacy&gt;[useless ones], but &lt;quantum computing player&gt;[the bets are on, big time].

To get a feeling of this, just have a look at the insane number of startups that are already developing &lt;quantum algorithms&gt; for hardware that doesn't/barely exists! https://quantumcomputingreport.com/players/privatestartup (https://web.archive.org/web/20191223175204/https://quantumcomputingreport.com/players/privatestartup/[archive]). Some feared we might be in a bubble: &lt;Are we in a quantum computing bubble?&gt;

To get a basic idea of what programming a quantum computer looks like start by reading: &lt;quantum computing is just matrix multiplication&gt;{full}.

Some people &lt;quantum computing skepticism&gt;[have their doubts], and that is not unreasonable, it might truly not work out. We could be on the verge of an &lt;AI winter&gt; of quantum computing. But &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; feels that it is genuinely impossible to tell as of 2020 if something will work out or not. We really just have to try it out and see. There must have been skeptics before every single &lt;next big thing&gt;.

= Quantum computing is just matrix multiplication
{synonym}
{title2}

This is a quick tutorial on how a &lt;quantum computer&gt; programmer thinks about how a quantum computer works. If you know:
* what a &lt;complex number&gt; is
* how to do &lt;matrix multiplication&gt;
* what is a &lt;probability&gt;
a concrete and precise &lt;hello world&gt; operation can be understood in 30 minutes.

Although there are several &lt;quantum computer physical implementations&gt;[types of quantum computer] under development, there exists a single high level model that represents what most of those computers can do, and we are going to explain that model here. This model is the is the &lt;digital quantum computer&gt; model, which uses a &lt;quantum circuit&gt;, that is made up of many &lt;quantum gates&gt;.

Beyond that basic model, programmers only may have to consider the &lt;quantum logic gates are needed for physical implementation&gt;[imperfections of their hardware], but the starting point will almost always be this basic model, and tooling that automates mapping the high level model to real hardware considering those imperfections (i.e. &lt;quantum compilers&gt;) is already getting better and better.

The way quantum programmers think about a quantum computer in order to program can be described as follows:
* the input of a N qubit quantum computer is a vector of dimension N containing classic bits 0 and 1
* the quantum program, also known as circuit, is a $2^n \times 2^n$ &lt;unitary matrix&gt; of &lt;complex numbers&gt; $Q \in \C^{2^n} \times \C^{2^n}$ that operates on the input to generate the output
* the output of a N qubit computer is also a vector of dimension N containing classic bits 0 and 1

To operate a quantum computer, you follow the &lt;step of operation of a quantum computer&gt;:
* set the input &lt;qubits&gt; to classic input bits (&lt;state initialization (quantum computing)&gt;)
* press a big red "RUN" button
* read the classic output bits (&lt;readout (quantum computing)&gt;)

Each time you do this, you are literally conducting a physical experiment of the specific &lt;quantum computer physical implementations&gt;[physical implementation] of the computer:
* setup your physical system to represent the classical 0/1 inputs
* let the state evolve for long enough
* measure the classical output back out
and each run as the above can is simply called "an experiment" or "a measurement".

The output comes out "instantly" in the sense that it is physically impossible to observe any intermediate state of the system, i.e. there are no clocks like in classical computers, further discussion at: &lt;quantum circuits vs classical circuits&gt;. Setting up, running the experiment and taking the does take some time however, and this is important because you have to run the same experiment multiple times because results are probabilistic as mentioned below.

Unlike in a classical computer, the output of a quantum computer is not deterministic however.

But the each output is not equally likely either, otherwise the computer would be useless except as &lt;random number generator&gt;!

This is because the probabilities of each output for a given input depends on the program (&lt;unitary matrix&gt;) it went through.

Therefore, what we have to do is to design the quantum circuit in a way that the right or better answers will come out more likely than the bad answers.

We then calculate the error bound for our circuit based on its design, and then determine how many times we have to run the experiment to reach the desired accuracy.

The probability of each output of a quantum computer is derived from the input and the circuit as follows.

First we take the classic input vector of dimension N of 0's and 1's and convert it to a "&lt;quantum state vector&gt;" $\va{q_{in}}$ of dimension $2^n$:
$$
\va{q_{in}} \in \C^{2^n}
$$

We are after all going to multiply it by the program matrix, as you would expect, and that has dimension $2^n \times 2^n$!

Note that this initial transformation also transforms the discrete zeroes and ones into &lt;complex numbers&gt;.

For example, in a 3 qubit computer, the quantum state vector has dimension $2^3 = 8$ and the following shows all 8 possible conversions from the classic input to the quantum state vector:
``
000 -&gt; 1000 0000 == (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,  0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
001 -&gt; 0100 0000 == (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0,  0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
010 -&gt; 0010 0000 == (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,  0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
011 -&gt; 0001 0000 == (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0,  0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
100 -&gt; 0000 1000 == (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,  1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
101 -&gt; 0000 0100 == (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,  0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
110 -&gt; 0000 0010 == (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,  0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
111 -&gt; 0000 0001 == (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,  0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
``

This can be intuitively interpreted as:
* if the classic input is `000`, then we are certain that all three bits are 0.

  Therefore, the probability of all three 0's is 1.0, and all other possible combinations have 0 probability.
* if the classic input is `001`, then we are certain that bit one and two are 0, and bit three is 1. The probability of that is 1.0, and all others are zero.
* and so on

Now that we finally have our quantum state vector, we just multiply it by the &lt;unitary matrix&gt; $Q$ of the quantum circuit, and obtain the $2^n$ dimensional output quantum state vector $\va{q_{out}}$:
$$
\va{q_{out}} = Q \: \va{q_{in}}
$$

And at long last, the probability of each classical outcome of the measurement is proportional to the square of the length of each entry in the quantum vector, analogously to what is done in the &lt;Schrödinger equation&gt;.

For example, suppose that the 3 qubit output were:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\va{q_{out}} &amp;=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
0.0 \\
\frac{1}{2} \\
0.0 \\
0.0 \\
0.0 \\
0.0 \\
0.0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

Then, the probability of each possible outcomes would be the length of each component squared:
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(000) &amp;= \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}^2 &amp;= \frac{3}{4} \\
P(001) &amp;= \left|0\right|^2                  &amp;= 0^2 &amp;= 0 \\
P(010) &amp;= \left|\frac{\sqrt{1}}{2}\right|^2 &amp;= \frac{\sqrt{1}}{2}^2 &amp;= \frac{1}{4} \\
P(011) &amp;= \left|0\right|^2                  &amp;= 0^2 &amp;= 0 \\
P(100) &amp;= \left|0\right|^2                  &amp;= 0^2 &amp;= 0 \\
P(101) &amp;= \left|0\right|^2                  &amp;= 0^2 &amp;= 0 \\
P(110) &amp;= \left|0\right|^2                  &amp;= 0^2 &amp;= 0 \\
P(111) &amp;= \left|0\right|^2                  &amp;= 0^2 &amp;= 0 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
i.e. 75% for the first, and 25% for the third outcomes, where just like for the input:
* first outcome means `000`: all output bits are zero
* third outcome means `010`: the first and third bits are zero, but the second one is 1

All other outcomes have probability 0 and cannot occur, e.g.: `001` is impossible.

Keep in mind that the &lt;quantum state vector&gt; can also contain &lt;why are complex numbers used in the Schrodinger equation?&gt;[complex numbers because we are doing quantum mechanics], but we just take their magnitude in that case, e.g. the following quantum state would lead to the same probabilities as the previous one:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\abs{\frac{1 + \sqrt{2}i}{2}}^2 &amp;= \frac{1^2 + \sqrt{2^2}}{2^2} &amp;= \frac{3}{4} \\
\abs{\frac{i}{2}}^2             &amp;= \frac{1^2}{2^2}              &amp;= \frac{1}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

This interpretation of the quantum state vector clarifies a few things:
* the input quantum state is just a simple state where we are certain of the value of each classic input bit
* the matrix has to be unitary because the total probability of all possible outcomes must be 1.0

  This is true for the input matrix, and unitary matrices have the probability of maintaining that property after multiplication.

  Unitary matrices are a bit analogous to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-adjoint_operator[self-adjoint operators] in general quantum mechanics (self-adjoint in finite dimensions implies is stronger)

  This also allows us to understand intuitively why quantum computers may be capable of accelerating certain algorithms exponentially: that is because the quantum computer is able to quickly do an unitary matrix multiplication of a humongous $2^{N}$ sized matrix.

  If we are able to encode our algorithm in that matrix multiplication, considering the probabilistic interpretation of the output, then we stand a chance of getting that speedup.

As we could see, this model is was simple to understand, being only marginally more complex than that of a classical computer, see also: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/6639/is-my-background-sufficient-to-start-quantum-computing/14317#14317 The situation of quantum computers today in the 2020's is somewhat analogous to that of the early days of classical circuits and computers in the 1950's and 1960's, before &lt;CPU&gt; came along and software ate the world. Even though the &lt;semiconductor physical implementation&gt;[exact physics of a classical computer] might be hard to understand and vary across different types of &lt;integrated circuits&gt;, those early hardware pioneers (and to this day modern CPU designers), can usefully view circuits from a higher level point of view, thinking only about concepts such as:
* &lt;logic gates&gt; like AND, NOR and NOT
* a clock + registers
as modelled at the &lt;register transfer level&gt;, and only in a separate compilation step translated into actual chips. This high level understanding of how a classical computer works is what we can call "the programmer's model of a classical computer". So we are now going to describe the quantum analogue of it.

This is the true key question: what are the most important algorithms that would be accelerated by quantum computing?

Some candidates:
* &lt;Shor's algorithm&gt;: this one will actually make humanity worse off, as we will be forced into &lt;post-quantum cryptography&gt; that will likely be less efficient than existing classical &lt;cryptography&gt; to implement
* &lt;quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations&gt;, and related &lt;application of systems of linear equations&gt;
* &lt;Grover's algorithm&gt;: speedup not exponential. Still useful for anything?
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform[Quantum Fourier transform]: TODO is the speedup exponential or not?
* Deutsch: solves an useless problem
* &lt;NISQ algorithms&gt;

Do you have proper optimization or &lt;quantum chemistry&gt; algorithms that will make trillions?

Maybe there is some room for doubt because some applications might be way better in some &lt;quantum computer physical implementations&gt;[implementations], but we should at least have a good general idea.

However, clear information on this really hard to come by, not sure why.

There is no fundamental difference between them, a &lt;quantum algorithm&gt; is a &lt;quantum circuit&gt;, which can be seen as a super complicated &lt;quantum gate&gt;.

Perhaps the greats practical difference is that algorithms tend to be defined for an arbitrary number of N qubits, i.e. as a &lt;function&gt; for that each N produces a specific &lt;quantum circuit&gt; with N &lt;qubits&gt; solving the problem. Most named gates on the other hand have fixed small sizes.

&gt; A group of Chinese researchers have just published a paper claiming that they can—although they have not yet done so—break 2048-bit RSA. This is something to take seriously. It might not be correct, but it’s not obviously wrong.

  We have long known from Shor’s algorithm that factoring with a quantum computer is easy. But it takes a big quantum computer, on the orders of millions of qbits, to factor anything resembling the key sizes we use today. What the researchers have done is combine classical lattice reduction factoring techniques with a quantum approximate optimization algorithm. This means that they only need a quantum computer with 372 qbits, which is well within what’s possible today. (The IBM Osprey is a 433-qbit quantum computer, for example. Others are on their way as well.)

Technique that uses multiple non-&lt;ideal&gt; qubits (physical qubits) to simulate/produce one perfect qubit (logical).

One is philosophically reminded of classical &lt;error correction codes&gt;, where we also have multiple input bits per actual information bit.

TODO understand in detail. This appears to be a fundamental technique since all physical systems we can manufacture are imperfect.

Part of the fundamental interest of this technique is due to the &lt;quantum threshold theorem&gt;.

For example, when https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-06/quantum-computing-startup-raises-215-million-for-faster-device[PsiQuantum raised 215M in 2020], they announced that they intended to reach 1 million physical qubits, which would achieve between 100 and 300 logical qubits.

= Quantum computers as experiments that are hard to predict outcomes
{parent=Quantum computing hardware}

One possibly interesting and possibly obvious point of view, is that a quantum computer is an experimental device that executes a quantum probabilistic experiment for which the probabilities cannot be calculated theoretically efficiently by a &lt;nuclear weapon&gt;.

This is how quantum computing was originally theorized by the likes of &lt;Richard Feynman&gt;: they noticed that "Hey, here's a well formulated &lt;quantum mechanics&gt; problem, which I know the algorithm to solve (calculate the probability of outcomes), but it would take exponential time on the problem size".

The converse is then of course that if you were able to encode useful problems in such an experiment, then you have a computer that allows for exponential speedups.

This can be seen very directly by studying one specific quantum computer implementation. E.g. if you take the simplest to understand one, &lt;photonic quantum computer&gt;, you can make systems for which you need exponential time to calculate the probabilities that photons will exit through certain holes and not others.

The obvious aspect of this idea is by coming from &lt;quantum logic gates are needed because you can't compute the matrix explicitly as it grows exponentially&gt;: knowing the full explicit matrix is impossible in practice, and knowing the matrix is equivalent to knowing the probabilities of every outcome.

= Tensor product in quantum computing
{parent=Quantum circuit}
{tag=Tensor product}

We don't need to understand a super generalized version of &lt;tensor products&gt; to know what they mean in basic &lt;quantum computing&gt;!

Intuitively, taking a &lt;tensor product&gt; of two &lt;qubits&gt; simply means putting them together on the same quantum system/computer.

When we write the &lt;bra-ket notation&gt;: $\ket{00}$ that is the same as $\ket{0} \otimes \ket{0}$.

The tensor product is called a "product" because it distributes over addition.

E.g. consider:
$$
(\frac{\ket{0} + \ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}) \otimes \ket{0} =
\frac{\ket{0} \otimes \ket{0} + \ket{1} \otimes \ket{0}}{\sqrt{2}} =
\frac{\ket{00} + \ket{10}}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

Intuitively, in this operation we just put a &lt;Hadamard gate&gt; qubit together with a second pure $\ket{0}$ qubit.

And the outcome still has the second qubit as always 0, because we haven't made them interact.

The &lt;quantum state&gt; $\frac{\ket{00} + \ket{10}}{\sqrt{2}}$ is called a &lt;separable state&gt;, because it can be written as a single product of two different qubits. We have simply brought two qubits together, without making them interact.

If we then add a &lt;CNOT gate&gt; to make a &lt;Bell state&gt;:
$$
\frac{\ket{00} + \ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}} =
\frac{\ket{0} \otimes \ket{0} + \ket{1} \otimes \ket{1}}{\sqrt{2}}
$$
we can now see that the &lt;Bell state&gt; is &lt;non-separable&gt;: we've made the two qubits interact, and there is no way to write this state with a single &lt;tensor product&gt;. The qubits are fundamentally &lt;entangled&gt;.

= Quantum circuits vs classical circuits
{parent=Quantum circuit}

Just like a classic &lt;software engineer&gt;[programmer] does not need to understand the intricacies of how transistors are implemented and &lt;CMOS&gt; semiconductors, the quantum programmer does not understand physical intricacies of the underlying &lt;quantum computer physical implementations&gt;[physical implementation].

The main difference to keep in mind is that quantum computers cannot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)[save and observe intermediate quantum state], so programming a quantum computer is basically like programming a combinatorial-like circuit with gates that operate on (qu)bits:
* https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/8441/does-a-quantum-computer-have-a-clock-signal-and-if-yes-how-big-is-it/9383#9383
* https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/8849/quantum-circuits-explain-algorithms-why-didnt-classical-circuits/8869#8869

For this reason programming a quantum computer is much like programming a classical combinatorial circuit as you would do with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE[SPICE], &lt;register transfer level&gt;[verilog-or-vhdl], in which you are basically describing a graph of gates that goes from the input to the output

For this reason, we can use the words "program" and "circuit" interchangeably to refer to a quantum program

Also remember that and there is no no clocks in combinatorial circuits because there are no registers to drive; and so there is no analogue of clock in the quantum system either,

Another consequence of this is that programming quantum computers does not look like programming the more "common" procedural programming languages such as C or Python, since those fundamentally rely on processor register / memory state all the time.

Quantum programmers can however use classic languages to help describe their quantum programs more easily, for example this is what happens in &lt;Qiskit&gt;, where you write a Python program that makes Qiskit library calls that describe the quantum program.

{synonym}

At &lt;quantum computing is just matrix multiplication&gt;{full} we saw that making a quantum circuit actually comes down to designing one big &lt;unitary matrix&gt;.

We have to say though that that was a bit of a lie.

Quantum programmers normally don't just produce those big matrices manually from scratch.

Instead, they use &lt;/quantum logic gates&gt;.

The following are the main reasons for that:
* &lt;quantum logic gates are needed because you can't compute the matrix explicitly as it grows exponentially&gt;{full}
* &lt;quantum logic gates are needed for physical implementation&gt;{full}

= Quantum logic gates are needed because you can't compute the matrix explicitly as it grows exponentially
{parent=Quantum logic gate}

One key insight, is that the matrix of a non-trivial quantum circuit is going to be huge, and won't fit into any amount classical memory that can be present in this universe.

This is because the matrix is exponential in the number qubits, and $2^{100}$ is more than the number of atoms in the universe!

Therefore, off the bat we know that we cannot possibly describe those matrices in an explicit form, but rather must use some kind of shorthand.

But it gets worse.

Even if we had enough memory, the act of explicitly computing the matrix is not generally possible.

This is because knowing the matrix, basically means knowing the probability result for all possible $2^{N}$ outputs for each of the $2^{N}$ possible inputs.

But if we had those probabilities, our algorithmic problem would already be solved in the first place! We would "just" go over each of those output probabilities (OK, there are $2^{N}$ of those, which is also an insurmountable problem in itself), and the largest probability would be the answer.

So if we could calculate those probabilities on a classical machine, we would also be able to simulate the quantum computer on the classical machine, and quantum computing would not be able to give exponential speedups, which we know it does.

To see this, consider that for a given input, say `000` on a 3 qubit machine, the corresponding 8-sized quantum state looks like:
``
000 -&gt; 1000 0000 == (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
``
and therefore when you multiply it by the unitary matrix of the quantum circuit, what you get is the first column of the unitary matrix of the quantum circuit. And `001`, gives the second column and so on.

As a result, to prove that a quantum algorithm is correct, we need to be a bit smarter than "just calculate the full matrix".

Which is why you should now go and read: &lt;quantum algorithm&gt;{full}.

This type of thinking links back to how physical experiments relate to quantum computing: a quantum computer realizes a physical experiment to which we cannot calculate the probabilities of outcomes without exponential time.

So for example in the case of a &lt;photonic quantum computer&gt;, you are not able to calculate from theory the probability that photons will show up on certain wires or not.

= Quantum logic gates are needed for physical implementation
{parent=Quantum logic gate}

One direct practical reason is that we need to map the matrix to real quantum hardware somehow, and all quantum hardware designs so far and likely in the future are gate-based: you manipulate a small number of qubits at a time (2) and add more and more of such operations.

While there are "&lt;quantum compilers&gt;" to increase the portability of quantum programs, it is to be expected that programs manually crafted for a specific hardware will be more efficient just like in classic computers.

TODO: is there any clear reason why computers can't beat humans in approximating any unitary matrix with a gate set?

This is analogous to what classic circuit programmers will do, by using smaller &lt;logic gates&gt; to create complex circuits, rather than directly creating one huge &lt;truth table&gt;.

The most commonly considered quantum gates take 1, 2, or 3 qubits as input.

The gates themselves are just unitary matrices that operate on the input qubits and produce the same number of output qubits.

For example, the matrix for the &lt;CNOT gate&gt;, which takes 2 qubits as input is:
``
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1
0 0 1 0
``

The final question is then: if I have a 2 qubit gate but an input with more qubits, say 3 qubits, then what does the 2 qubit gate (4x4 matrix) do for the final big 3 qubit matrix (8x8)? In order words, how do we scale quantum gates up to match the total number of qubits?

The intuitive answer is simple: we "just" extend the small matrix with a larger identity matrix so that the sum of the probabilities third bit is unaffected.

More precisely, we likely have to extend the matrix in a way such that the https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/71462/how-are-partial-measurements-performed-on-a-n-qubit-quantum-circuit[partial measurement] of the original small gate qubits leaves all other qubits unaffected.

For example, if the circuit were made up of a CNOT gate operating on the first and second qubits as in:
``
0 ----+----- 0
      |
1 ---CNOT--- 1

2 ---------- 2
``

then we would just extend the 2x2 CNOT gate to:

TODO lazy to properly learn right now. Apparently you have to use the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product[Kronecker product] by the identity matrix. Also, &lt;zX-calculus&gt; appears to provide a powerful alternative method in some/all cases.

{parent=Quantum logic gate}
{wiki=Quantum_logic_gate\#Universal_quantum_gates}

Just https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_completeness[like as for classic gates], we would like to be able to select &lt;quantum computer physical implementations&gt; that can represent one or a few gates that can be used to create \i[any] quantum circuit.

Unfortunately, in the case of quantum circuits this is obviously impossible, since the space of N x N unitary matrices is infinite and continuous.

Therefore, when we say that certain gates form a "set of universal quantum gates", we actually mean that "any unitary matrix can be approximated to arbitrary precision with enough of these gates".

Or if you like fancy Mathy words, you can say that the subgroup of the &lt;unitary group&gt; &lt;subgroup generated by a group&gt;[generated by] our basic gate set is a &lt;dense set&gt;[dense subset] of the unitary group.

&lt;Controlled quantum gates&gt; are gates that have two types of input qubits:

* operand &lt;qubits&gt; (terminology made up by &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; just now)
These gates can be understood as doing a certain &lt;unitary operation&gt; only if the control qubits are enabled or disabled.

This gate is the first example of a &lt;controlled quantum gate&gt; that you should study.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}

0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\

{description=The symbol follow the generic symbol convention for &lt;controlled quantum gates&gt; shown at &lt;image Generic controlled quantum gate symbol&gt;, but replacing the generic "U" with the &lt;image Quantum NOT gate symbol&gt;.}

To understand why the gate is called a CNOT gate, you should think as follows.

First let's produce a generic &lt;quantum state&gt; vector where the control qubit is certain to be 0.

On the standard basis:
$$
\ket{00} \\
\ket{01} \\
\ket{10} \\
\ket{11} \\
$$
we see that this means that only $\ket{00}$ and $\ket{01}$ should be possible. Therefore, the state must be of the form:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where $x$ and $y$ are two &lt;complex numbers&gt; such that $|x| + |y| = 1.0$

If we operate the &lt;CNOT gate&gt; on that state, we obtain:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}

\times

\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}

=

\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
and so the input is unchanged as desired, because the control qubit is 0.

If however we take only states where the control qubit is for sure 1:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}

\times

\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}

=

\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
y \\
x
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Therefore, in that case, what happened is that the probabilities of $\ket{10}$ and $\ket{11}$ were swapped from $x$ and $y$ to $y$ and $x$ respectively, which is exactly what the &lt;quantum NOT gate&gt; does.

So from this we understand more concretely what "the gate only operates if the first &lt;qubit&gt; is set to one" means.

Now go and study the &lt;Bell state&gt; and understand intuitively how this gate is used to produce it.

This gate set alone is not a set of &lt;universal quantum gates&gt;.

Notably, circuits containing those gates alone can be fully simulated by classical computers according to the &lt;Gottesman-Knill theorem&gt;, so there's no way they could be universal.

This means that if we add any number of Clifford gates to a quantum circuit, we haven't really increased the complexity of the algorithm, which can be useful as a transformational device.

A popular set of &lt;universal quantum gates&gt; derived from &lt;Clifford gates&gt; is &lt;Clifford plus T&gt;.

  &gt; As Alex Keesling, CEO of &lt;QuEra&gt; told me, "... whereas in gate-based \[digital\] quantum computing the focus is on the sequence of the gates, in analog quantum processing it's more about the position of the atoms and where you place them so they can mirror real life problems. We arrange the atoms and define the forces that drive them and then measure the result... so it’s a geometric encoding of the problem itself."
  So we understand that it is truly like the &lt;classical computer&gt; analog vs digital case.

Based on the &lt;Josephson effect&gt;. Yet another application of that phenomenal phenomena!

Philosophically, &lt;superconducting qubits are good because superconductivity is macroscopic&gt;.

It is fun to see that the representation of information in the QC basically uses an &lt;LC circuit&gt;, which is a very classical resonator circuit.

As mentioned at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_quantum_computing#Qubit_archetypes[] there are actually a few different types of superconducting qubits:
* flux
* charge
* phase

and hybridizations of those such as:
* &lt;transmon&gt;

Input:
* &lt;microwave&gt; radiation to excite circuit, or do nothing and wait for it to fall to 0 spontaneously

* https://youtu.be/uPw9nkJAwDY?t=471 mentions that the frequency between states 0 and 1 is chosen to be 6 GHz:
  * higher frequencies would be harder/more expensive to generate
  * lower frequencies would mean less energy according to the &lt;Planck relation&gt;. And less energy means that thermal energy would matter more, and introduce more noise.

    6 GHz is about $6^9 \times h = 6 \times 10^9 \times 6.62 \times 10^{-34} \approx 4\e{-24} J$

    From the definition of the &lt;Boltzmann constant&gt;, the temperature which has that average energe of particles is of the order of:
    $$
    T = E/k_b = 4\e{-24}/1.38\e{-23} \approx 0.3K
    $$
  This explains why we need to go to much lower temperatures than simply the &lt;superconducting temperature of aluminum&gt;!

= Superconducting quantum computer need non-linear components
{parent=Superconducting quantum computing}

Non-linearity is needed otherwise the input energy would just make the state go to higher and higher energy levels, e.g. from 1 to 2. But we only want to use levels 0 and 1.

The way this is modelled in by starting from a pure &lt;LC circuit&gt;, which is an harmonic oscillator, see also &lt;quantum LC circuit&gt;, and then replacing the linear &lt;inductor&gt; with a &lt;SQUID device&gt;, e.g. mentioned at: https://youtu.be/eZJjQGu85Ps?t=1655 &lt;video Superconducting Qubits I Part 1 by Zlatko Minev (2020)&gt;.

* requires intense refrigeration to 15mK in &lt;dilution refrigerator&gt;. Note that this is much lower than the actual &lt;superconducting temperature&gt; of the metal, we have to go even lower to reduce noise enough, see e.g. https://youtu.be/uPw9nkJAwDY?t=471 from &lt;video Building a quantum computer with superconducting qubits by Daniel Sank (2019)&gt;
* less connectivity, normally limited to 4 nearest neighbours, or maybe 6 for 3D approaches, e.g. compared to &lt;trapped ion quantum computers&gt;, where each trapped ion can be entangled with every other on the same chip

= Superconducting qubits are bad because it is harder to ensure that they are all the same

= Pro of superconducting qubits
{parent=Pros and cons of superconducting qubits}

= Superconducting qubits are good because superconductivity is macroscopic
{parent=Pro of superconducting qubits}

Superconducting qubits are regarded as promising because superconductivity is a &lt;macroscopic quantum phenomena&gt; of &lt;Bose-Einstein condensate&gt;[Bose Einstein condensation], and so as a macroscopic phenomena, it is easier to control and observe.

This is mentioned e.g. in this relatively early: https://physicsworld.com/a/superconducting-quantum-bits/[]. While most quantum phenomena is observed at the atomic scale, &lt;superconducting qubits&gt; are micrometer scale, which is huge!
&gt; Physicists are comfortable with the use of quantum mechanics to describe atomic and subatomic particles. However, in recent years we have discovered that micron-sized objects that have been produced using standard semiconductor-fabrication techniques – objects that are small on everyday scales but large compared with atoms – can also behave as quantum particles.

= Superconducting qubits are bad because of fabrication variation
{parent=Pro of superconducting qubits}

Atom-based &lt;qubits&gt; like &lt;trapped ion quantum computers&gt; have parameters fixed by the laws of physics.

However superconducting qubits have a limit on how precise their parameters can be set based on how well we can fabricate devices. This may require per-device characterisation.

In &lt;Ciro's ASCII art circuit diagram notation&gt;, it is a loop with three &lt;Josephson junctions&gt;:
``

|          |
|          |
|          |
+--X----X--+

\Video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQJMwvxC_U]
{title=Superconducting Qubit by NTT SCL (2015)}
{description=
Offers an interesting interpretation of &lt;superposition&gt; in that type of device (TODO precise name, seems to be a &lt;flux qubit&gt;): current going clockwise or current going counter clockwise at the same time. https://youtu.be/xjlGL4Mvq7A?t=1348 clarifies that this is just one of the types of qubits, and that it was developed by &lt;#Hans Mooij&gt; et. al., with a proposal in 1999 and experiments in 2000. The other type is dual to this one, and the &lt;superposition&gt; of the other type is between N and N + 1 copper pairs stored in a box.

Their circuit is a loop with three &lt;Josephson junctions&gt;, in &lt;Ciro's ASCII art circuit diagram notation&gt;:
``
+----X-----+
|          |
|          |
|          |
+--X----X--+
``

They name the clockwise and counter clockwise states $\ket{L}$ and $\ket{R}$ (named for Left and Right).

When half the &lt;magnetic flux quantum&gt; is applied as &lt;microwaves&gt;, this produces the ground state:
$$
\ket{0} = \ket{L} + \ket{R}
$$
where $L$ and $R$ cancel each other out. And the first excited state $\ket{1}$ is:
$$
\ket{0} = \ket{L} - \ket{R}
$$
Then he mentions that:
* to go from 0 to 1, they apply the difference in energy
* if the duration is reduced by half, it creates a superposition of $\ket{0} + \ket{1}$.
}

= Transmon
{parent=Superconducting qubit type}
{title2=2007}
{wiki}

Used e.g. in the &lt;Sycamore processor&gt;.

The most basic type of transmon is in &lt;Ciro's ASCII art circuit diagram notation&gt;, an &lt;LC circuit&gt; e.g. as mentioned at https://youtu.be/cb_f9KpYipk?t=180[] from &lt;video The transmon qubit by Leo Di Carlo (2018)&gt;:
``
+----------+
| Island 1 |
+----------+
   |   |
   X   C
   |   |
+----------+
| Island 2 |
+----------+
``

https://youtu.be/eZJjQGu85Ps?t=2443 from &lt;video Superconducting Qubits I Part 1 by Zlatko Minev (2020)&gt; describes a (possibly simplified) physical model of it, as two superconducting metal islands linked up by a &lt;Josephson junction&gt; marked as `X` in the diagram as per-&lt;Ciro's ASCII art circuit diagram notation&gt;:
``
+-------+       +-------+
|       |       |       |
| Q_1() |---X---| Q_2() |
|       |       |       |
+-------+       +-------+
``
The circuit is then analogous to a &lt;LC circuit&gt;, with the islands being the &lt;capacitor&gt;. The &lt;Josephson junction&gt; functions as a non-linear &lt;inductor&gt;.

Others define it with a &lt;SQUID device&gt; instead: https://youtu.be/cb_f9KpYipk?t=328 from &lt;video The transmon qubit by Leo Di Carlo (2018)&gt;. He mentions that this allows tuning the inductive element without creating a new device.

{title=Trapping Ions for Quantum Computing by Diana Craik (2019)}
{description=
A basic introduction, but very concrete, with only a bit of math it might be amazing:
* https://youtu.be/j1SKprQIkyE?t=217 you need &lt;ultra-high vacuum&gt;
* https://youtu.be/j1SKprQIkyE?t=257 you put the &lt;Calcium&gt; on a "calcium oven", heat it up, and make it evaporates a little bit
* https://youtu.be/j1SKprQIkyE?t=289 you need &lt;lasers&gt;. You shine the laser on the calcium atom to eject one of the two valence electrons from it. Though e.g. &lt;Universal Quantum&gt; is trying to do away with them, because alignment for thousands or millions of particles would be difficult.
* https://youtu.be/j1SKprQIkyE?t=518 keeping all surrounding electrodes positive would be unstable. So they instead alternate electrode quickly between plus and minus
* https://youtu.be/j1SKprQIkyE?t=643 talks about the alternative, of doing it just with electrodes on a chip, which is easier to manufacture. They fly at about 100 microns above the trap. And you can have multiple ions per chip.
* https://youtu.be/j1SKprQIkyE?t=1165 using &lt;microwaves&gt; you can flip the &lt;spin&gt; of the &lt;electron&gt;, or put it into a superposition. From more reading, we understand that she is talking about a &lt;hyperfine transition&gt;, which often happen in the &lt;microwave&gt; area.
* https://youtu.be/j1SKprQIkyE?t=1210 talks about making &lt;quantum gates&gt;. You have to put the ions into a &lt;magnetic field&gt; at one of the two &lt;resonance frequencies&gt; of the system. Presumably what is meant is an inhomogenous magnetic field as in the &lt;Stern-Gerlach experiment&gt;.

  This is the hard and interesting part. It is not clear why the atoms become coupled in any way. Is it due to electric repulsion?

  She is presumably describing the &lt;Cirac–Zoller CNOT gate&gt;.
Sounds complicated, several technologies need to work together for that to work! Videos of ions moving are from https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/group/ion-trap-quantum-computing[].

A major flaw of this presentation is not explaining the &lt;readout (quantum computing)&gt; process.

Trapped ion people acknowledge that they can't put a million qubits in on chip (TODO why) so they are already thinking of ways to entangle separate chips. Thinking is maybe the key word here. One of the propoesd approaches inolves optical links. &lt;Universal Quantum&gt; for example explicitly rejects that idea in favor of electric field link modularity.

{description=
Co-founder of &lt;IonQ&gt;. Cool dude. Starts with basic background we already know now. Mentions that there is some relationship between &lt;atomic clocks&gt; and &lt;trapped ion quantum computers&gt;, which is interesting. Then he goes into turbo mode, and you get lost unless you're an expert! &lt;video Quantum Simulation and Computation with Trapped Ions by Christopher Monroe (2021)&gt; is perhaps a better watch.
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=1216 &lt;superconducting qubits are bad because it is harder to ensure that they are all the same&gt;
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=1270 our wires are provided by &lt;lasers&gt;. Gives example of &lt;ytterbium&gt;$^{+1}$, which has nice frequencies for practical &lt;laser&gt; choice. Ytterbium ends in 6s2 5d1, so they must remove the 5d1 electron? But then you are left with 2 electrons in 6s2, can you just change their spins at will without problem?
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=1391 a single atom actually reflects 1% of the input laser, not bad!
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=1475 a transition that they want to drive in Ytterbium has 355 nm, which is easy to generate TODO why.
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=1520 mentions that 351 would be much harder, e.g. as used in inertially confied fusion, takes up a room
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=1539 what they use: a &lt;pulsed laser&gt;. It is made primarily for &lt;photolithography&gt;, &lt;Coherent, Inc.&gt; makes 200 of them a year, so it is reliable stuff and easy to operate. At https://www.coherent.com/lasers/nanosecond/avia-nx we can see some of their 355 offers. https://archive.ph/wip/JKuHI shows a used system going for 4500 USD.
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=1584 Cirac and Zoller proposed the idea of using entangled ions soon after they heard about &lt;Shor's algorithm&gt; in 1995
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=1641 you use &lt;optical tweezers&gt; to move the pairs of ions you want to entangle. This means shining a &lt;laser&gt; on two ions at the same time. Their movement depends on their &lt;spin&gt;, which is already in a superposition. If both move up, their distance stats the same, so the &lt;Coulomb interaction&gt; is unchanged. But if they are different, then one goes up and the other down, distance increases due to the diagonal, and energy is lower.
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=1939 S. Debnah 2016 Nature experiment with a pentagon. Well, it is not a pentagon, they are just in a linear chain, the pentagon is just to convey the full connectivity. Maybe also &lt;Satanism&gt;. Anyways. This point also mentions usage of an &lt;acousto-optic modulator&gt; to select which atoms we want to act on. On the other side, a simpler wide laser is used that hits all atoms (&lt;optical tweezers&gt; are literally like tweezers in the sense that you use two lasers). Later on mentions that the modulator is from Harris, later merged with L3, so: https://www.l3harris.com/all-capabilities/acousto-optic-solutions
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=2119 &lt;Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm&gt;. This to illustrate better connectivity of their ion approach compared to an &lt;IBM quantum computer&gt;, which is a &lt;superconducting quantum computer&gt;
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=2354 &lt;hidden shift algorithm&gt;
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=2740 Zhang et al. Nature 2017 paper about a 53 ion system that calculates something that cannot be classically calculated. Not fully controllable though, so more of a &lt;continuous-variable quantum information&gt; operation.
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=2923 usage of cooling to 4 K to get lower pressures on top of vacuum. Before this point all experiments were room temperature. Shows image of refrigerator labelled Janis cooler, presumably something like: https://qd-uki.co.uk/cryogenics/janis-recirculating-gas-coolers/
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=2962 qubit vs gates plot by H. Neven
* https://youtu.be/9aOLwjUZLm0?t=3108 &lt;modular trapped ion quantum computer&gt; ideas. Mentions experiment with 2 separate systems with optical link. Miniaturization and their black box. Mentions again that their chip is from &lt;Sandia&gt;. Amazing how you pronounce that.

Funding rounds:

  * 67m euro contract with the &lt;German&gt; government: https://www.uktech.news/deep-tech/universal-quantum-german-contract-20221102 Both co-founders are German. They then immediatly announced several jobs in Hamburg: https://apply.workable.com/universalquantum/?lng=en#jobs so presumably linked to the Hamburg University of Technology campus of the German Aerospace Center.
  * https://medium.com/@universalquantum/universal-quantum-wins-67m-contract-to-build-the-fully-scalable-trapped-ion-quantum-computer-16eba31b869e
* 2021: \$10M (7.5M GBP) grant from the &lt;British Government&gt;: https://www.uktech.news/news/brighton-universal-quantum-wins-grant-20211105

  This grant is very secretive, very hard to find any other information about it! Most investment trackers are not listing it.

  The article reads:
  &gt; Universal Quantum will lead a consortium that includes Rolls-Royce, quantum developer &lt;Riverlane&gt;, and world-class researchers from &lt;Imperial College London&gt; and The &lt;University of Sussex&gt;, among others.
  Interesting!

  A but further down the article gives some more information of partners, from which some of the hardware vendors can be deduced:
  &gt; The consortium includes end-user &lt;Rolls-Royce&gt; supported by the &lt;Science and Technology Facilities Council&gt; (STFC) Hartree Centre, quantum software developer &lt;Riverlane&gt;, supply chain partners Edwards, https://www.tmd.co.uk/[TMD Technologies] (now acquired by Communications &amp; Power Industries (CPI)) and https://www.diamondmic.com/[Diamond Microwave]
  * Edwards is presumably &lt;Edwards Vacuum&gt;, since we know that &lt;trapped ion quantum computers&gt; rely heavily on good vacuum systems. Edwards Vacuum is also located quite close to Universal Quantum as of 2022, a few minutes drive.
  * TMD Technologies is a &lt;microwave&gt; technology vendor amongst other things, and we know that microwaves are used e.g. to initialize the spin states of the ions
  * Diamond Microwave is another microwave stuff vendor

  The money comes from UK's "Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund".

  https://www.riverlane.com/news/2021/12/riverlane-joins-7-5-million-consortium-to-build-error-corrected-quantum-processor/ gives some more details on the use case provided by Rolls Royce:
  &gt; The work with Rolls Royce will explore how quantum computers can develop practical applications toward the development of more sustainable and efficient jet engines.  

    This starts by applying quantum algorithms to take steps to toward a greater understanding of how liquids and gases flow, a field known as '&lt;fluid dynamics&gt;'. Simulating such flows accurately is beyond the computational capacity of even the most powerful classical computers today.

  This funding was part of a larger quantum push by the &lt;UKNQTP&gt;: https://www.ukri.org/news/50-million-in-funding-for-uk-quantum-industrial-projects/

Uses &lt;photons&gt;!

The key experiment/phenomena that sets the basis for photonic quantum computing is the &lt;two photon interference experiment&gt;.

The physical representation of the information encoding is very easy to understand:
* input: we choose to put or not photons into certain wires or no
* interaction: two wires pass very nearby at some point, and photons travelling on either of them can jump to the other one and interact with the other photons
* output: the probabilities that photos photons will go out through one wire or another

Good talk by CEO before starting the company which gives insight on what they are very likely doing: &lt;video Jeremy O'Brien: "Quantum Technologies" by GoogleTechTalks (2014)&gt;

PsiQuantum appears to be particularly secretive, even more than other startups in the field.

They want to reuse classical &lt;semiconductor physical implementation&gt;[semiconductor fabrication technologies], notably they have close ties to &lt;GlobalFoundries&gt;.

So he went to the &lt;US&gt; and raised N times more from the &lt;American&gt; &lt;military-industrial complex&gt;.

Once upon a time, the &lt;British Government&gt; decided to invest some 80 million into &lt;quantum computing&gt;.

&lt;Jeremy O'Brien&gt; told his peers that he had the best tech, and that he should get it all.

Some well connected peers from well known universities did not agree however, and also bid for the money, and won.

Jeremy was defeated. And pissed.

So he moved to &lt;Palo Alto&gt; and raised a total of \$665 million instead as of 2021. The end.

Makes for a reasonable &lt;the old man lost his horse&gt;.

https://www.ft.com/content/afc27836-9383-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271 British quantum computing experts leave for Silicon Valley talks a little bit about them leaving, but nothing too juicy. They were called PsiQ previously apparently.
&gt; The departure of some of the UK’s leading experts in a potentially revolutionary new field of technology will raise fresh concerns over the country’s ability to develop industrial champions in the sector.
More interestingly, the article mentions that this was party advised by early investor &lt;Hermann Hauser&gt;, who is known to be preoccupied about UK's ability to create companies. Of course, &lt;European Tower of Babel&gt;.

= Quantum interconnect
{parent=Quantum computing}

"Quantum interconnect" refers to methods for linking up smaller quantum processors into a larger system.

As of 2024, seemingly few &lt;organizations developing quantum hardware&gt; had actually integrated multiple chips in interconnects as part of their main current roadmap. But many acknowledged that this would be an essential step towards scalable compuation.

The name "quantum interconnect" is likely partly a throwback to &lt;classical computer&gt;'s "&lt;chip interconnect&gt;".

{parent=Qiskit example}
{tag=Hello world}

The official &lt;hello world&gt; is documented at: https://qiskit.org/documentation/intro_tutorial1.html and contains a &lt;Bell state circuit&gt;.

Our version at &lt;qiskit/hello.py&gt;{file}.

= qiskit/hello.py
{file}
{parent=Qiskit hello world}

Our example uses a &lt;Bell state circuit&gt; to illustrate all the fundamental &lt;Qiskit&gt; basics.

Sample program output, `counts` are randomized each time.

First we take the &lt;quantum state vector&gt; immediately after the $\ket{00}$ input.
``
input:
state:
Statevector([1.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j],
            dims=(2, 2))
probs:
[1. 0. 0. 0.]
``
We understand that the first element of `Statevector` is $\ket{00}$, and has probability of 1.0.

Next we take the state after a &lt;Hadamard gate&gt; on the first &lt;qubit&gt;:
``
h:
state:
Statevector([0.70710678+0.j, 0.70710678+0.j, 0.        +0.j,
             0.        +0.j],
            dims=(2, 2))
probs:
[0.5 0.5 0.  0. ]
``
We now understand that the second element of the `Statevector` is $\ket{01}$, and now we have a 50/50 propabability split for the first bit.

Then we apply the &lt;CNOT gate&gt;:
``
cx:
state:
Statevector([0.70710678+0.j, 0.        +0.j, 0.        +0.j,
             0.70710678+0.j],
            dims=(2, 2))
probs:
[0.5 0.  0.  0.5]
``
which leaves us with the final $\frac{\ket{00} + \ket{11}}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Then we print the circuit a bit:
``

     ┌───┐

     └───┘┌─┴─┐

``

And finally we &lt;quantum compilation&gt;[compile] the circuit and do some sample measurements:
``

{parent=Qiskit example}

In this example we will initialize a quantum circuit with a single &lt;CNOT gate&gt; and see the output values.

By default, &lt;Qiskit&gt; initializes every &lt;qubit&gt; to 0 as shown in the &lt;qiskit/hello.py&gt;{file}. But we can also initialize to arbitrary values as would be done when computing the output for various different inputs.

Output:

So this also serves as a more interesting example of &lt;quantum compilation&gt;, mapping the `QFT` gate to &lt;Qiskit Aer&gt; primitives.

If we don't `transpile` in this example, then running blows up with:
``
qiskit_aer.aererror.AerError: 'unknown instruction: QFT'
``

The second input is:
$$
x_i = \frac{1}{2} sin(2 * \pi * i / 8)
$$
and the output of that approximately:
``
[0, 1j/sqrt(2), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1j/sqrt(2)]
``
which can be defined simply as the &lt;normalized DFT&gt; of the input &lt;quantum state vector&gt;.

From this we see that the &lt;Quantum Fourier transform&gt; is equivalent to a direct &lt;discrete Fourier transform&gt; on the &lt;quantum state vector&gt;, related: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/110073/how-to-derive-quantum-fourier-transform-from-discrete-fourier-transform-dft

{parent=Quantum computing}

In the context of &lt;quantum computing&gt; of the 2020's, a "classical computer" is a &lt;computer&gt; that is not "quantum", i.e., the then dominating &lt;CMOS&gt; computers.

= ZX-calculus
{parent=Quantum computing}
{wiki}

As https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ZX-calculus&amp;oldid=1071329204#Diagram_rewriting tries to explain &lt;ourbigbook.com/Wikipedia&gt;[but fails to deliver as usual] consider the &lt;GHZ state&gt; represented as a quantum circuit.

How can we easily prove that that quantum circuit equals the state:
$$
\frac{|000&gt; + |111&gt;}{\sqrt{2}}
$$
?

The naive way would be to just do the matrix multiplication as explained at &lt;quantum computing is just matrix multiplication&gt;{full}.

However, ZX-calculus provides a simpler way.

And even more importantly, sometimes it is the only way, because in a real circuit, we would not be able to do the matrix multiplication 

What we do in ZX-calculus is we first transform the original quantum circuit into a ZX graph.

This is always possible, because we can describe how to do the conversion simply for any of the &lt;Clifford plus T&gt; gates, which is a set of &lt;universal quantum gates&gt;.

Then, after we do this transformation, we can start applying further transformations that simplify the circuit.

It has already been proven that there is no efficient algorithm for this (TODO source, someone said P-sharp complete best case)

But it has been proven in 2017 that any possible equivalence between quantum circuits can be reached by modifying ZX-calculus circuits.

There are only 7 transformation rules that we need, and all others can be derived from those, universality.

So, we can apply those rules to do https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ZX-calculus&amp;oldid=1071329204#Diagram_rewriting[the transformation shown in Wikipedia]:

\Image[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/GHZ_circuit_as_ZX-diagram.svg]
{title=GHZ circuit as ZX-diagram}
{height=500}

and one of those rules finally tells us that that last graph means our desired state:
$$
\frac{|000&gt; + |111&gt;}{\sqrt{2}}
$$
because it is a Z spider with $m = 3$ and $n = 1$.

= Bell state
{c}
{parent=Quantum state}
{wiki}

One of the four following states:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ket{\Phi^+} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{00} &amp;+ \ket{11})
\ket{\Phi^-} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{00} &amp;- \ket{11})
\ket{\Psi^+} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{01} &amp;+ \ket{10})
\ket{\Psi^-} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{01} &amp;- \ket{10})
\end{aligned}
$$

When unqualified as in "the Bell state", it generally just means $\ket{\Phi^+}$.

The Bell states are entangled and &lt;non-separable&gt;. Intuitively, we can see that when we measure that state, the values of the first and second bit are strictly correlated. This is the hallmark of &lt;quantum computation&gt;: making up states where qubits are highly correlated to match a specific algorithmic answer, and opposed to uniformly random noise. For example, the &lt;Bell state circuit&gt; is a common &lt;hello world&gt;, e.g. it is used in the official &lt;Qiskit hello world&gt;.

{title=&lt;Quantum circuit&gt; that generates the &lt;Bell state&gt;}
{description=
The fundamental intuition for this circuit is as follows.

First the &lt;Hadamard gate&gt; makes the first &lt;qubit&gt; be in a 50/50 state.

Then, the &lt;CNOT gate&gt; gets controlled by that 50/50 value, and the controlled qubit also gets 50/50 chance as a result.

However, both qubits are now &lt;entangled&gt;: the result of the second qubit depends on the result of the first one. Because:
* if the first qubit is 0, cnot is not active, and so the second qubit remains 0 as its input
* if the first qubit is 1, cnot is active, and so the second qubit is flipped to 1

= Quantum computer benchmark
{parent=Quantum computing}
{wiki}

One important area of research and development of &lt;quantum computing&gt; is the development of benchmarks that allow us to compare different quantum computers to decide which one is more powerful than the other.

Ideally, we would like to be able to have a single number that predicts which computer is more powerful than the other for a wide range of algorithms.

However, much like in &lt;CPU&gt; benchmarking, this is a very complex problem, since different algorithms might perform differently in different architectures, making it very hard to sum up the architecture's capabilities to a single number as we would like.

The only thing that is directly comparable across computers is how two machines perform for a single algorithm, but we want a single number that is representative of many algorithms.

For example, the number of qubits would be a simple naive choice of such performance predictor number. But it is very imprecise, since other factors are also very important:
* qubit error rate
* &lt;coherence time&gt;, which determines the maximum circuit depth
* qubit connectivity. Can you only connect to 4 neighbouring qubits in a 2D plane? Or to every other qubit equally as well?

&lt;Quantum volume&gt; is another less naive attempt at such metric.

It takes time for the quantum state to evolve. So in order to have a deep &lt;quantum circuit&gt;, we need longer &lt;coherence times&gt;.

= Depth of a quantum circuit

This is an important metric, because it takes some time for the quantum operations to propagate, and so the depth of a circuit gives you an idea of how long the &lt;coherence time&gt; a hardware needs to support a given circuit.

&lt;Encryption algorithms&gt; that run on &lt;classical computers&gt; that are expected to be resistant to &lt;quantum computers&gt;.

This is notably not the case of the dominant 2020 algorithms, &lt;RSA (cryptosystem)&gt; and &lt;elliptic curve cryptography&gt;, which are provably broken by &lt;Grover's algorithm&gt;.

However, as of 2020, we &lt;provably quantum secure encryption algorithm&gt;[don't have any proof that any symmetric or public key algorithm is quantum resistant].

Post-quantum cryptography is the very first quantum computing thing at which people have to put money into.

The reason is that attackers would be able to store captured &lt;ciphertext&gt;, and then retroactively break them once and if &lt;quantum computing&gt; power becomes available in the future.

There isn't a shade of a doubt that &lt;intelligence agencies&gt; are actively doing this as of 2020. They must have a database of how interesting a given source is, and then store as much as they can given some ammount of storage budget they have available.

A good way to explain this to &lt;quantum computing skeptics&gt; is to ask them:
&gt; If I told you there is a 5% chance that I will be able to decrypt everything you write online starting today in 10 years. Would you give me a dollar to reduce that chance to 0.5%?
Post-quantum cryptography is simply not a choice. It must be done now. Even if the risk is low, the cost would be way too great.

This &lt;post-quantum cryptography&gt; competition by &lt;NIST&gt; is a huge milestone of the field.

It was mind blowing when in 2022, after several years of selection, one of the 7 finalists was broken on a &lt;classical computer&gt;, not even in a quantum computer! https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30466063 | https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/214 Breaking Rainbow Takes a Weekend on a Laptop by Ward Beullens.

Edit: and then, after the third round, things were a bit unclear, so they made a fourth round with 4 choices out of the 7 from round 3, and in August 2022 one of the four was broken again on a classic CPU!!!
