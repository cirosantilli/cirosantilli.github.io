When Bo Ya's will was towards flowing water in his playing, Zhong Ziqi would say, "How vast are the rivers and oceans!" Whatever Bo Ya thought of Ziqi would never fail to understand. Bo Ya said, "Amazing! Your heart and mine are the same!" After Zhong Ziqi died, Bo Ya broke his Guqin because he thought that no one else can understand his music.

The dialog is also known as &lt;allegory&gt; for an incredibly deep philosophical discussion between an idealized wise woodcutter and a fisherman, e.g. mentioned at: https://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Fisherman%20and%20Woodcutter.pdf

This song is just too slow for &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; to make much out of it.

The most important publisher, AKA "CRC Jianian". TODO meaning of Jianian?

&lt;Discogs&gt; entry: https://www.discogs.com/label/743059-China-Record-Corporation?page=1

&lt;Chinese government&gt; owned unfortunately.

Their website takes forever to load: http://www.china-crc.com.cn/[], and features mostly Communist shit, and I can't find the decent traditional music listed there.

One thing to try is an &lt;Amazon&gt; advanced search by label "China Record Co": https://www.amazon.com/s?i=digital-music&amp;rh=p_33%3AChina+Record+Co&amp;s=relevancerank&amp;Adv-Srch-MP3-Submit.x=42&amp;Adv-Srch-MP3-Submit.y=4&amp;unfiltered=1&amp;ref=sr_adv_m_digital
