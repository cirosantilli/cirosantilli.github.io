&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; is mildly obsessed by nuclear reactions, because they are so &lt;Ciro Santilli's self perceived creative personality&gt;[quirky]. How can a little ball destroy a city? How can putting too much of it together produce criticality and kill people like in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core[Slotin accident] or the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWomuWd7-to[Tokaimura criticality accident]. It is &lt;mind blowing&gt; really.

* https://youtu.be/8uIPQBOCJ64?t=3291 mentions &lt;variable yield&gt; devices, this is the main new thing &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; learned from this video
* https://youtu.be/8uIPQBOCJ64?t=3416 discusses if a &lt;strategic nuclear weapon&gt; usage would inevitably lead to &lt;tactical nuclear weapon&gt; escalation. It then mentions one case in which a possibly comparable escalation didn't happen: the abstinence of using &lt;chemical weapon&gt; during &lt;World War II&gt;.

{wiki}

&lt;Gun-type fission weapons&gt; are the simplest approach and they work with &lt;Uranium-235&gt; bombs as you can ignite it with just one explosion.

But &lt;Gun-type fission weapons don't work with plutonium&gt;, and &lt;weapon grade Plutonium is cheaper than weapon grade Uranium&gt;, so it wasn't much used.

= Gun-type fission weapons don't work with plutonium
{parent=Gun-type fission weapon}

&lt;Gun-type fission weapons&gt; don't work with &lt;Plutonium-239&gt; because of the presence of &lt;Plutonium-240&gt; as an impurity which leads to &lt;fizzle (nuclear explosion)&gt;.

Good mentions at: https://youtu.be/dgBDvnqMkT4?t=252

= Implosion-type fission weapon
{parent=Fission weapon by geometry}
{wiki=Nuclear_weapon_design\#Implosion-type}

&lt;Implosion-type fission weapons&gt; are more complicated than &lt;gun-type fission weapon&gt; because you have to precisely coordinate the detonation of a bunch of explosives.

For &lt;nuclear weapons&gt; you need a certain level of &lt;isotope&gt; purity of either &lt;plutonium-239&gt; or &lt;uranium-235&gt;.

And the easiest way by far to achieve this purity is to produce &lt;plutonium-239&gt; in a &lt;breeder reactor&gt;, which allows you to get it out with much cheaper chemical processes rather than costly &lt;isotope separation&gt; methods.

https://sgp.fas.org/othergov/doe/pu50yc.html mentions:
&gt; The United States Government has used 14 &lt;plutonium&gt; production reactors at the &lt;Hanford site&gt;[Hanford] and &lt;Savannah River site&gt;[Savannah River] sites to produce plutonium for the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and DOE research and development programs. From 1944 to 1994, these reactors produced 103.4 metric tons of plutonium; 67.4 MT at Hanford, and 36.1 at Savannah River.
That site also contains a good summary of the closed shutdown reactors in each site. These are publicly disclosed e.g. at: https://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/ProjectsFacilities

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwKhz7BPBLY mentions that before they stopped production at the end of the &lt;Cold War&gt;, &lt;Hanford site&gt; produced 2/3 of the total American stockpile, and &lt;Savannah River site&gt; produced 1/3.

https://www.reuters.com/article/world/americas-nuclear-headache-old-plutonium-with-nowhere-to-go-idUSKBN1HR1JT/ claims that as of 2018 &lt;Savannah River site&gt; stored the majority of the stockpile.

TODO is there any information available on active &lt;breeder reactors&gt;? Hanford apparently shutdown.

&gt; After the closure of the country’s prime plutonium manufacturing plant at Rocky Flats in 1992, where 1,000 to 2,000 pits were produced every year, a highly reinforced 236,000 sq-ft facility built at &lt;LANL&gt; earlier in 1978 became the first Department of Energy (DoE) facility capable of producing plutonium cores.

  Although initially established for plutonium research and development, in 2003 the &lt;LANL PF-4&gt;[Plutonium Facility Building 4 (PF-4)] within Tech Area 55 at Los Alamos produced the nation’s stockpile quality (first war reserve) plutonium. In 2006, Congress instructed the DoE to focus on producing pits at this facility.

The &lt;B Reactor&gt; of the facility produced the &lt;plutonium&gt; used for &lt;Trinity (nuclear test)&gt; and &lt;Fat Man&gt;, and then for many more thousand bombs during the &lt;Cold War&gt;. More precisely, this was done at 

Located in &lt;Washington (state)&gt;, in a dry place the middle of the mountainous areas of the Western &lt;United States&gt;, where basically no one lives. The Columbia river is however nearby, that river is quite large, and provided the water needed by their activities, notably for cooling the &lt;nuclear reactors&gt;. It is worth it having look on &lt;Google Maps&gt; to get a feel for the region.

Unlike many other such laboratories, this one did not become a &lt;United States Department of Energy national laboratories&gt;. It was likely just too polluted.

Good video, clarifies several interesting technical points:
* &lt;Gun-type fission weapon&gt; were much easier to build as you don't need super synchronized charges as in &lt;implosion-type fission weapon&gt;. But they are less efficient.
* &lt;Plutonium&gt; make much more efficient usage of &lt;uranium&gt;, because you don't need to highly enrich a bunch of &lt;Uranium-235&gt; in the first place, but rather just use way less enriched &lt;Uranium-235&gt; to produce a bunch of &lt;Plutonium&gt; by converting &lt;Uranium-238&gt;
