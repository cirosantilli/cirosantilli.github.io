{c}
{synonym}

Some of Feynman's key characteristics are:
* obsession with understanding the experiments well, see also &lt;how to teach and learn physics&gt;{full}
* when doing more &lt;mathematical&gt; stuff, analogous obsession about starting with a concrete example and then generalizing that into the theory
* liked to teach others. At &lt;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&gt; for example he mentions that one key problem of the &lt;Institute for Advanced Study&gt; is that they didn't have to teach, and besides that making you feel useless when were not having new ideas, it is also the case that student's questions often inspire you to look again in some direction which sometimes happens to be profitable

  He hated however mentoring others one to one, because almost everyone was too stupid for him
* interest in other &lt;natural sciences&gt;, and also random art and culture (and especially if it involves pretty women)

Some non-Physics related ones, mostly highlighted at &lt;Genius: Richard Feynman and Modern Physics by James Gleick (1994)&gt;:
* &lt;Feynman was a huge womanizer during a certain period of his life&gt;
* he hated pomp, going as far as seeming uneducated to some people in the way he spoke, or going out of his way to look like that. This is in stark contrast to "rivals" &lt;Murray Gell-Mann&gt; and &lt;Julian Schwinger&gt;, who were posh/snobby.

Even &lt;Apple&gt; thinks so according to their &lt;Think different&gt; campaign: http://www.feynman.com/fun/think-different/

&lt;quantum electrodynamics&gt; lectures:
* &lt;Richard Feynman Quantum Electrodynamics Lecture at University of Auckland (1979)&gt;

Feynman was apparently seriously interested/amused by &lt;computer&gt;:
* &lt;video Los Alamos From Below by Richard Feynman (1975)&gt; see description for the human &lt;emulator&gt;
* &lt;quantum computers as experiments that are hard to predict outcomes&gt; was first attributed to Feynman
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKWGGDXe5MA Richard Feynman Computer Heuristics Lecture (1986)

{tag=Gossip}
{title2=Richard Feynman's first wife}
{title2=1919 - 1945-06-16}

&lt;Feynman&gt;'s first wife, previously his local-&lt;high school&gt;-days darling. &lt;Feynman&gt; was like an reversed &lt;Stephen Hawking&gt;: he married his wife knowing that she had a serious illness, while Hawking's wife married him knowing that as well. Except that in Feynman's case, the disease outcome (&lt;tuberculosis&gt;[tuberculosis]) was much more uncertain, and she tragically died in 1945 much earlier while &lt;Feynman&gt; was at &lt;Los Alamos Laboratory&gt;, while &lt;Hawking&gt;, despite his decline, lived much longer.

Feynman first noticed Arline on the beaches on the region of his home in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Rockaway,_Queens[Far Rockaway], in the Queens, &lt;New York&gt;, near Long Beach. She lived a bit further inland in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedarhurst,_New_York[Cedarhurst]. Arline was beautiful and boys competed for her, but Richard persisted, stalking her at an after-school social league sponsored by the local &lt;Synagogue&gt; and joining an art class she went to, until he eventually won it out. The region was highly &lt;Jewish&gt;, and both were from Jewish families, as also suggested by their family names.

Reading about her death e.g. at &lt;Genius: Richard Feynman and Modern Physics by James Gleick (1994)&gt; is a major tearjerker, it's just too horrible. The book mentions on chapter "The Last Springtime" that at last, during the last months of her life, after much hesitation, they did &lt;fuck&gt; in the sanatorium Arline where was staying at in &lt;Albuquerque&gt;, the nearest major city to &lt;Los Alamos&gt; (154 km), despite the risk of Feynman being infected, which would be particularly serious given that Feynman would be in constant contact with students and possibly infect others as part of his career as a researcher/teacher. Feynman would visit her on weekends by bus, and stay in &lt;Los Alamos&gt; during the week.

Arline finally died on June 16th 1945, exactly one month before the &lt;Trinity (nuclear test)&gt; nuclear test was carried out. The &lt;atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki&gt; were a little later on 6 and 9 of August 1945.

On one of his last trips to &lt;Oak Ridge&gt; town late 1945, after her death, &lt;Feynman&gt; walked past a shop window and saw a pretty dress. He thought to himself, "Arline would have liked that", and the reminder made him cry for the first time after Arline's death.

It is even sadder to think that the first &lt;antibiotics&gt; for &lt;tuberculosis&gt;[tuberculosis], &lt;streptomycin&gt;, finished its first major clinical trial at around 1948, not long after her &lt;death&gt;.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; considers this tragedy a cause of &lt;Feynman was a huge womanizer during a certain period of his life&gt;.

{title=&lt;Abacus&gt; scene from the film &lt;Infinity (1996 film)&gt; (1996)}
{description=
The film suggests that Feynman and Arline &lt;fucked&gt; a lot before the final &lt;Los Alamos&gt; fuck, that fuck story from book being only "fuck after &lt;tuberculosis&gt;[tuberculosis] diagnosis", after which they had to slow it down a bit.

This is likely true given how long they had been together for at that point. &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; is such a pure soul for not having thought that! They were not very conservative at all those two.

Also their wedding got slowed down because there was a clause in Feynman's scholarship at &lt;Princeton University&gt; stating that the recipient could not be married, those were different times altogether.

Good film, it feels quite realistic.

It is a shame that they tried to include some particularly interesting stories but didn't have the time to develop them, e.g. Feynman explaining to the high school interns what they were actually doing. These are referred to only in passing, and likely won't mean anything to someone who hasn't read the book.

The film settings are particularly good, and give what feels like an authentic view of the times. Particularly memorable are the Indian caves shown the film. TODO name? Possibly https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puye_Cliff_Dwellings[Puye Cliff Dwellings]. Puye apparently appears prominently up on another film about Los Alamos: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atomic_City[The Atomic city (1952)]. It is relatively close to Los Alamos, about 30 km away.

The title is presumably a reference to &lt;infinities in quantum field theory&gt;? Or just to the infinity of love etc.? But anyways, the &lt;infinities in quantum field theory&gt; theory come to mind if you are into this kind of stuff and is sad because that work started after the war.

= Feynman was a huge womanizer during a certain period of his life
{c}
{parent=Personal life of Richard Feynman}

&lt;Feynman&gt; became a terrible &lt;womanizer&gt; after his first wife &lt;Arline Greenbaum&gt; died, involving himself with several married women, and leading to at least two &lt;abortions&gt; according to &lt;Genius: Richard Feynman and Modern Physics by James Gleick (1994)&gt;.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; likes to think that he is quite liberal and not a strict follower of &lt;Christian&gt; morals, but this one shocked him slightly even. Feynman could be a &lt;God&gt;, but he could also be a &lt;dick&gt; sometimes.

One particular case that stuck to &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s mind, partly because he is &lt;Brazilian&gt;, is when &lt;Feynman&gt; was in &lt;Brazil&gt;, he had a girlfriend called Clotilde that called him "Ricardinho", which means "Little Richard"; -inho is a &lt;diminutive&gt; suffix in &lt;Portuguese (language)&gt;, and also indicates affection. At some point he even promised to take her back to the &lt;United States&gt;, but didn't in the end, and instead came back and married his second wife in marriage that soon failed.

Richard's third and final wife, Gweneth Howarth, seemed a good match for him though. When they started &lt;courting&gt;, she made it very clear that Feynman should decide if he wanted her or not soon, because she had other options available and being actively tested. &lt;Fight fire with fire&gt;.

From &lt;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman chapter O Americano, Outra Vez!&gt;:
&gt; The people from the airlines were somewhat bored with their lives, strangely enough, and at night they would often go to bars to drink. I liked them all, and in order to be sociable, I would go with them to the bar to have a few drinks, several nights a week.

  One day, about 3:30 in the afternoon, I was walking along the sidewalk opposite the beach at Copacabana past a bar. I suddenly got this treMENdous, strong feeling: "That's just what I want; that'll fit just right. I'd just love to have a drink right now!"

  I started to walk into the bar, and I suddenly thought to myself, "Wait a minute! It's the middle of the afternoon. There's nobody here, There's no social reason to drink. Why do you have such a terribly strong feeling that you have to have a drink?" - and I got scared.

  I never drank ever again, since then. I suppose I really wasn't in any danger, because I found it very easy to stop. But that strong feeling that I didn't understand frightened me. You see, I get such fun out of thinking that I don't want to destroy this most pleasant machine that makes life such a big kick. It's the same reason that, later on, I was reluctant to try experiments with &lt;LSD&gt; in spite of my curiosity about hallucinations.

One notable &lt;recreational drug&gt;[drug] early teens Ciro consumed was &lt;Magic: The Gathering&gt;, see also: &lt;magic: The Gathering is addictive&gt;{full}.

This is a good book.

It has some overlap with &lt;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&gt;, which it likely takes as primary sources of some stories.

However, while Surely goes into a lot of detail of each event, this book paints a more cohesive and global picture of things.

In terms of hard physics/mathematics, this book takes the approach of spending a few paragraphs in some chapters describing in high level terms some of the key ideas, which is a good compromise. It does sometime fall into the sin of &lt;to talk about something without giving the real name to not scare off the audience&gt;, but it does give a lot of names, notably it talks a lot about &lt;Lagrangian mechanics&gt;. And it goes into more details than Surely in any case.

Particularly interesting is the quote about how they used the typist secretary pool to &lt;emulate&gt; the &lt;IBM&gt; machines and debug their programs before the machines had arrived. This is exactly analogous to what is done in 2020 in the &lt;semiconductor&gt; industry, where slower models are used to estimate how future algorithms will run in future hardware.

"O Americano, Outra Vez!" means "The American, once again!" in &lt;Portuguese (language)&gt;, which is what one of the samba school boss exclaimed when Feynman was not playing well his instrument, the frigideira, during a rehearsal.

Feynman really enjoyed Brazil's (and notably &lt;Rio&gt;'s) stereotypical "take it easy and enjoy life" attitude.
