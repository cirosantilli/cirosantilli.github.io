= Machine learn
{synonym}

The main reason &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; never touched it is that it feels that every public data set has already been fully mined or has already had the most interesting algorithms developed for it, so you can't do much outside of big companies.

This is why Ciro started &lt;Ciro's 2D reinforcement learning games&gt; to generate synthetic data and thus reduce the cost of data.

The other reason is that it is ugly.

{title2=PCA}
{wiki}

Given a bunch of points in $n$ dimensions, PCA maps those points to a new $p$ dimensional space with $p \le n$.

$p$ is a &lt;hyperparameter&gt;, $p=1$ and $p=2$ are common choices when doing dataset exploration, as they can be easily visualized on a planar plot.

The mapping is done by projecting all points to a $p$ dimensional &lt;hyperplane&gt;. PCA is an algorithm for choosing this hyperplane and the coordinate system within this hyperplane.

The hyperplane choice is done as follows:
* the &lt;hyperplane&gt; will have origin at the &lt;mean&gt; point
* the first axis is picked along the direction of greatest &lt;variance&gt;, i.e. where points are the most spread out.

  Intuitively, if we pick an axis of small variation, that would be bad, because all the points are very close to one another on that axis, so it doesn't contain as much information that helps us differentiate the points.
* then we pick a second axis, orthogonal to the first one, and on the direction of second largest variance
* and so on until $p$ orthogonal axes are taken

https://www.sartorius.com/en/knowledge/science-snippets/what-is-principal-component-analysis-pca-and-how-it-is-used-507186 provides an OK-ish example with a concrete context. In there, each point is a country, and the input data is the consumption of different kinds of foods per year, e.g.:
* flour
* dry codfish
* olive oil
* sausage
so in this example, we would have input points in 4D.

The question is then: we want to be able to identify the country by what they eat.

Suppose that every country consumes the same amount of flour every year. Then, that number doesn't tell us much about which country each point represents (has the least &lt;variance&gt;), and the first PCA axes would basically never point anywhere near that direction.

Another cool thing is that PCA seems to automatically account for linear dependencies in the data, so it skips selecting highly correlated axes multiple times. For example, suppose that dry codfish and olive oil consumption are very high in Portugal and Spain, but very low in Germany and Poland. Therefore, the variation is very high in those two parameters, and contains a lot of information.

However, suppose that dry codfish consumption is also directly proportional to olive oil consumption. Because of this, it would be kind of wasteful if we selected:
* dry codfish as the first axis
* olive oil as the second axis
since the information about codfish already tells us the olive oil. PCA apparently recognizes this, and instead picks the first axis at a 45 degree angle to both dry codfish and olive oil, and then moves on to something else for the second axis.

We can see that much like the rest of &lt;machine learning&gt;, PCA can &lt;Machine learning as a form of data compression&gt;[be seen as a form of compression].

= Hyperparameter
{parent=Machine learning}
{tag=AI-complete}
{wiki=Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)}

A parameter that you choose which determines how the algorithm will perform.

In the case of &lt;machine learning&gt; in particular, it is not part of the &lt;training data set&gt;.

Hyperparameters can also be considered in domains outside of &lt;machine learning&gt; however, e.g. the step size in &lt;partial differential equation solver&gt; is entirely independent from the problem itself and could be considered a hyperparamter. One difference from machine learning however is that step size hyperparameters in &lt;numerical analysis&gt; are clearly better if smaller at a higher computational cost. In machine learning however, there is often an optimum somewhere, beyond which &lt;overfitting&gt; becomes excessive.

= Machine learning as a form of data compression
{parent=Overfitting}
{tag=Overfitting}

Philosophically, machine learning can be seen as a form of &lt;lossy compression&gt;.

And if we make it too &lt;lossless&gt;, then we are basically &lt;overfitting&gt;.

An impossible &lt;AI-complete&gt; dream!

It is impossible to understand speech, and take meaningful actions from it, if you don't understand what is being talked about.

And without doubt, "understanding what is being talked about" comes down to understanding (efficiently representing) the geometry of the 3D world with a time component.

Not from hearing sounds alone.

This is the first thing you have to know about &lt;supervised learning&gt;:
* training is when you learn model parameters from input. This literally means learning the best value we can for a bunch of number input numbers of the model. This can easily be on the hundreds of thousands.
* inference is when we take a trained model (i.e. with the parameters determined), and apply it to new inputs
Both of those already have &lt;hardware acceleration&gt; available as of the 2010s.

https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/resources/resnet_50_v1_5_for_pytorch explains:
&gt; The difference between v1 and v1.5 is that, in the bottleneck blocks which requires downsampling, v1 has stride = 2 in the first 1x1 convolution, whereas v1.5 has stride = 2 in the 3x3 convolution.

  This difference makes ResNet50 v1.5 slightly more accurate (~0.5% top1) than v1, but comes with a small performance drawback (~5% imgs/sec).

CNN convolution kernels are not hardcoded. They are learnt and optimized via &lt;backpropagation&gt;. You just specify their size! Example in &lt;PyTorch&gt; you'd do just:
``
nn.Conv2d(1, 6, kernel_size=(5, 5))
``
as used for example at: &lt;activatedgeek LeNet-5&gt;.

This can also be inferred from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55594969/how-to-visualise-filters-in-a-cnn-with-pytorch where we see that the kernels are not perfectly regular as you'd expected from something hand coded.

https://github.com/activatedgeek/LeNet-5

This repository contains a very clean minimal &lt;PyTorch&gt; implementation of &lt;LeNet-5&gt; for &lt;MNIST&gt;.

It trains the &lt;LeNet-5&gt; &lt;neural network&gt; on the &lt;MNIST&gt; dataset from scratch, and afterwards you can give it newly hand-written digits 0 to 9 and it will hopefully recognize the digit for you.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; created a small fork of this repo at &lt;lenet&gt;{file} adding better automation for:
* &lt;extracting MNIST images&gt; as PNG
* &lt;ONNX&gt; CLI inference taking any image files as input
* a &lt;Python tkinter&gt; GUI that lets you draw and see inference live
* running on &lt;GPU&gt;

Install on &lt;Ubuntu 24.10&gt; with:
``
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
git clone https://github.com/activatedgeek/LeNet-5
cd LeNet-5
git checkout 95b55a838f9d90536fd3b303cede12cf8b5da47f
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install \
  Pillow==6.2.0 \
  numpy==1.24.2 \
  onnx==1.13.1 \
  torch==2.0.0 \
  torchvision==0.15.1 \
  visdom==0.2.4 \
;
``
We use our own `pip install` because their requirements.txt uses `&gt;=` instead of `==` making it random if things will work or not.

On &lt;Ubuntu 22.10&gt; it was instead:
``
pip install
  Pillow==6.2.0 \
  numpy==1.26.4 \
  onnx==1.17.0 torch==2.6.0 \
  torchvision==0.21.0 \
  visdom==0.2.4 \
;
``

Then run with:
``
python run.py
``
This script:
* does a fixed 15 &lt;epoch (deep learning)&gt;[epochs] on the &lt;training data&gt;
* it then uses the trained net from memory to check accuracy with the &lt;test data&gt;
* then it also produces a `lenet.onnx` &lt;ONNX&gt; file which contains the trained network, nice!
It throws a billion exceptions because we didn't start the Visdom server, but everything works nevertheless, we just don't get a visualization of the training.

The terminal outputs lines such as:
``
Train - Epoch 1, Batch: 0, Loss: 2.311587
Train - Epoch 1, Batch: 10, Loss: 2.067062
Train - Epoch 1, Batch: 20, Loss: 0.959845
...
Train - Epoch 1, Batch: 230, Loss: 0.071796
Test Avg. Loss: 0.000112, Accuracy: 0.967500
...
Train - Epoch 15, Batch: 230, Loss: 0.010040
Test Avg. Loss: 0.000038, Accuracy: 0.989300
``

And the runtime on &lt;Ubuntu 22.10&gt;, &lt;Ciro Santilli's hardware/P51&gt; was:
``
real    2m10.262s
user    11m9.771s
sys     0m26.368s
``

One of the benefits of the &lt;ONNX&gt; output is that we can nicely visualize the &lt;neural network&gt; on &lt;Netron&gt;:

This doesn't seem to conform to the original &lt;LeNet-5&gt; however?

= activatedgeek/LeNet-5 use ONNX for inference
{parent=activatedgeek LeNet-5}

Now let's try and use the trained &lt;ONNX&gt; file for inference on some manually drawn images on &lt;GIMP&gt;:

\Image[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/media/master/Digit_9_hand_drawn_by_Ciro_Santilli_on_GIMP_with_mouse_white_on_black.png]
{title=Number 9 drawn with mouse on &lt;GIMP&gt; by &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; (2023)}

Note that:
* the images must be drawn with white on black. If you use black on white, it the accuracy becomes terrible. This is a good very example of &lt;brittleness in AI&gt; systems!
* images must be converted to 32x32 for `lenet.onnx`, as that is what training was done on. The training step converted the 28x28 images to 32x32 as the first thing it does before training even starts

We can try the code adapted from https://thenewstack.io/tutorial-using-a-pre-trained-onnx-model-for-inferencing/[] at \a[lenet/infer.py]:
``
cd lenet
cp ~/git/LeNet-5/lenet.onnx .

./infer.py 9.png
``
and it works pretty well! The program outputs:
``
9
``
as desired.

We can also try with images directly from &lt;Extract MNIST images&gt;.
``
infer_mnist.py lenet.onnx mnist_png/out/testing/1/*.png
``
and the accuracy is great as expected.

Deep learning is the name &lt;artificial neural networks&gt; basically converged to in the 2010s/2020s.

It is a bit of an unfortunate as it suggests something like "deep understanding" and even reminds one of &lt;AGI&gt;, which it almost certainly will not attain on its own. But at least it sounds good.

https://mlcommons.org/en/ Their homepage is not amazingly organized, but it does the job.

Benchmark focused on &lt;deep learning&gt;. It has two parts:
* &lt;training (ML)&gt;: produces a trained network
* &lt;inference (ML)&gt;: uses the trained network
Furthermore, a specific network model is specified for each benchmark in the closed category: so it goes beyond just specifying the dataset.

Results can be seen e.g. at:
* &lt;training (ML)&gt;: https://mlcommons.org/en/training-normal-21/ (https://web.archive.org/web/20230923035847/https://mlcommons.org/en/training-normal-21/[archive])
* &lt;inference (ML)&gt;: https://mlcommons.org/en/inference-datacenter-21/ (https://web.archive.org/web/20230923030959/https://mlcommons.org/en/inference-datacenter-21/)
Those URLs broke as of 2025 of course, now you have to click on their Tableau down to the 2.1 round and there's no fixed URL for it:
* https://mlcommons.org/benchmarks/training/
* https://mlcommons.org/benchmarks/inference-datacenter/

And there are also separate repositories for each:
* https://github.com/mlcommons/inference
* https://github.com/mlcommons/training

E.g. on https://mlcommons.org/en/training-normal-21/ we can see what the the benchmarks are:

where presumably `qps` means queries per second, and is the main results we are interested in, the more the better.

Running:

produces a tiny &lt;ImageNet subset&gt; with 8 images under `fake_imagenet/`.

where the numbers are the category indices from &lt;ImageNet1k&gt;. At https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a see e.g.:
* 817: 'sports car, sport car',
* 89: 'sulphur-crested cockatoo, Kakatoe galerita, Cacatua galerita',
and so on, so they are coherent with the image names. By quickly looking at the script we see that it just downloads from Wikimedia and manually creates the file.

TODO prepare and test on the actual &lt;ImageNet&gt; validation set, README says:
&gt; Prepare the imagenet dataset to come.

Since that one is undocumented, let's try the &lt;COCO dataset&gt; instead, which uses &lt;COCO 2017&gt; and is also a bit smaller. Note that his is not part of MLperf anymore since v2.1, only &lt;ImageNet&gt; and open images are used. But still:

fails immediately with:

The more plausible looking:

``
first takes a while to preprocess something most likely, which it does only one, and then fails:

{parent=MLperf v2.1 ResNet}

Let's run on this Imagenet10 subset called &lt;Imagenette&gt;.

First ensure that you get the dummy test data run working as per &lt;MLperf v2.1 ResNet&gt;.

Next, in the `imagenette2` directory, first let's create a 224x224 scaled version of the inputs as required by the benchmark at https://mlcommons.org/en/inference-datacenter-21/[]:
``
#!/usr/bin/env bash

  for img in "$syndir"/*; do
    convert "$img" -resize 224x224 "val224x224/$syn/$(basename "$img")"
  done
done
``
and then let's create the `val_map.txt` file to match the format expected by MLPerf:
``
#!/usr/bin/env bash

  i=$((i + 1))
done &lt; &lt;( sort map_clsloc.txt )
``
then back on the mlperf directory we download our model:
``

``
and finally run!
``

which gives on &lt;Ciro Santilli's hardware/P51&gt;:

``

The `time=23.924` is much smaller than the `time` executable because of some lengthy pre-loading (TODO not sure what that means) that gets done every time:
``

The most important thing this project provides appears to be the `.onnx` file format, which represents &lt;ANN models&gt;, pre-trained or not.

&lt;Deep learning frameworks&gt; can then output such `.onnx` files for interchangeability and serialization.

Some examples:
* &lt;activatedgeek LeNet-5&gt; produces a trained `.onnx` from &lt;PyTorch&gt;
* &lt;MLperf v2.1 ResNet&gt; can use `.onnx` as a pre-trained model

The cool thing is that &lt;ONNX&gt; can then run &lt;inference&gt; in an uniform manner on a variety of devices without installing the &lt;deep learning framework&gt; used for. It's a bit like having a kind of portable executable. Neat.

{tag=Pre-trained computer vision model}

Contains several &lt;computer vision&gt; models, e.g. &lt;ResNet&gt;, all of them including &lt;pre-trained computer vision model&gt;[pre-trained] versions on some dataset, which is quite sweet.

Documentation: https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html

= torchvision ResNet
{parent=torchvision}

https://pytorch.org/vision/0.13/models.html has a minimal runnable example adapted to \a[python/pytorch/resnet_demo.py].

That example uses a &lt;ResNet&gt; pre-trained on the &lt;COCO dataset&gt; to do some inference, tested on &lt;Ubuntu 22.10&gt;:
``
cd python/pytorch
wget -O resnet_demo_in.jpg https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Rooster_portrait2.jpg/400px-Rooster_portrait2.jpg
./resnet_demo.py resnet_demo_in.jpg resnet_demo_out.jpg
``
This first downloads the model, which is currently 167 MB.

We know it is COCO because of the docs: https://pytorch.org/vision/0.13/models/generated/torchvision.models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn_v2.html which explains that 
``
FasterRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_V2_Weights.DEFAULT
``
is an alias for:
``
FasterRCNN_ResNet50_FPN_V2_Weights.COCO_V1
``

The runtime is relatively slow on &lt;Ciro Santilli's hardware/P51&gt;, about 4.7s.

After it finishes, the program prints the recognized classes:
``
['bird', 'banana']
``
so we get the expected `bird`, but also the more intriguing `banana`.

By looking at the output image with bounding boxes, we understand where the banana came from!

70,000 28x28 grayscale (1 byte per pixel) images of hand-written digits 0-9, i.e. 10 categories. 60k are considered &lt;training data&gt;, 10k are considered for &lt;test data&gt;.

This is THE "&lt;OG&gt;" &lt;computer vision dataset&gt;.

Playing with it is the de-facto &lt;computer vision&gt; &lt;hello world&gt;.

It was on this dataset that &lt;Yann LeCun&gt; made great progress with the &lt;LeNet&gt; model. Running &lt;LeNet&gt; on &lt;MNIST&gt; has to be the most classic computer vision thing ever. See e.g. &lt;activatedgeek LeNet-5&gt; for a minimal and modern &lt;PyTorch&gt; educational implementation.

But it is important to note that as of the 2010's, the benchmark had become too easy for many applications. It is perhaps fair to say that the next big dataset revolution of the same importance was with &lt;ImageNet&gt;.

The dataset could be downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/[] but as of March 2025 it was down and seems to have broken from time to time randomly, so &lt;Wayback Machine&gt; to the rescue:

14 million images with more than 20k categories, typically denoting prominent objects in the image, either common daily objects, or a wild range of animals. About 1 million of them also have &lt;bounding boxes&gt; for the objects. The images have different sizes, they are not all standardized to a single size like &lt;MNIST&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36109886/what-is-the-resolution-of-an-image-in-imagenet-dataset{ref}.

Each image appears to have a single label associated to it. Care must have been taken somehow with categories, since some images contain severl possible objects, e.g. a person and some object.

In practice, the &lt;ILSVRC&gt; subset of &lt;ImageNet&gt; is the most commonly used dataset.

Official project page: https://www.image-net.org/

The data license is restrictive and forbids commercial usage: https://www.image-net.org/download.php[]. Also as a result you have to login to download the dataset. Super annoying.

How to visualize: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/111756/where-can-i-view-the-imagenet-classes-as-a-hierarchy-on-wordnet

The categories are all part of &lt;WordNet&gt;, which means that there are several parent/child categories such as dog vs type of dog available. &lt;ImageNet1k&gt; only appears to have leaf nodes however (i.e. no "dog" label, just specific types of dog).

A major model that performed well on &lt;ImageNet&gt; starting on 2012 and became notable is &lt;AlexNet&gt;.

* https://github.com/BenediktAlkin/ImageNetSubsetGenerator

Unfortunately, since &lt;ImageNet&gt; is a &lt;closed standard&gt; no one can upload such pre-made subsets, forcing everybody to download the full dataset, in &lt;ImageNet1k&gt;, which is huge!

Subset of &lt;ImageNet&gt;. About 167.62 GB in size according to https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/data[].

Contains 1,281,167 images and exactly 1k categories which is why this dataset is also known as ImageNet1k: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/47458/what-is-the-difference-between-imagenet-and-imagenet1k-how-to-download-it

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/overview clarifies a bit further how the categories are inter-related according to &lt;WordNet&gt; relationships:
&gt; The 1000 object categories contain both internal nodes and leaf nodes of ImageNet, but do not overlap with each other.

https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/browse-synsets.php lists all 1k labels with their &lt;WordNet&gt; IDs.
``
n02119789: kit fox, Vulpes macrotis
n02100735: English setter
n02096294: Australian terrier
``
There is a bug on that page however towards the middle:
``
n03255030: dumbbell
href="ht:
n02102040: English springer, English springer spaniel
``
and there is one missing label if we ignore that dummy `href=` line. A thinkg of beauty!

Also the lines are not sorted by synset, if we do then the first three lines are:
``
n01440764: tench, Tinca tinca
n01443537: goldfish, Carassius auratus
n01484850: great white shark, white shark, man-eater, man-eating shark, Carcharodon carcharias
``

https://gist.github.com/aaronpolhamus/964a4411c0906315deb9f4a3723aac57 has lines of type:
``
n02119789 1 kit_fox
n02100735 2 English_setter
n02110185 3 Siberian_husky
``
therefore numbered on the exact same order as https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/browse-synsets.php

https://gist.github.com/yrevar/942d3a0ac09ec9e5eb3a lists all 1k labels as a plaintext file with their benchmark IDs.
``
{0: 'tench, Tinca tinca',
 1: 'goldfish, Carassius auratus',
 2: 'great white shark, white shark, man-eater, man-eating shark, Carcharodon carcharias',
``
therefore numbered on sorted order of https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/browse-synsets.php

The official line numbering in-benchmark-data can be seen at `LOC_synset_mapping.txt`, e.g. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/data?select=LOC_synset_mapping.txt
``

n01484850 great white shark, white shark, man-eater, man-eating shark, Carcharodon carcharias
``

https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k also has some useful metrics on the split:
* train: 1,281,167 images, 145.7 GB zipped
* validation: 50,000 images, 6.67 GB zipped
* test: 100,000 images, 13.5 GB zipped

{parent=ImageNet}

The official page: https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/index.php points to a download link on &lt;Kaggle&gt;: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/imagenet-object-localization-challenge/data Kaggle says that the size is 167.62 GB!

To download from Kaggle, create an API token on kaggle.com, which downloads a `kaggle.json` file then:
``
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
mv ~/down/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle
python3 -m pip install kaggle
kaggle competitions download -c imagenet-object-localization-challenge
``
The download speed is wildly server/limited and take A LOT of hours. Also, the tool does not seem able to pick up where you stopped last time.

Another download location appears to be: https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k on &lt;Hugging Face&gt;, but you have to login due to their license terms. Once you login you have a very basic data explorer available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k/viewer/default/train[].

https://cocodataset.org

From https://cocodataset.org/[]:
* 330K images (&gt;200K labeled)
* 1.5 million object instances
* 80 object categories
* 91 stuff categories
* 5 captions per image. A caption is a short textual description of the image.

So they have relatively few object labels, but their focus seems to be putting a bunch of objects on the same image. E.g. they have 13 cat plus pizza photos. Searching for such weird combinations is kind of fun.

Their official dataset explorer is actually good: https://cocodataset.org/#explore

And the objects don't just have bounding boxes, but detailed polygons.

Also, images have captions describing the relation between objects:
&gt; a black and white cat standing on a table next to a pizza.
Epic.

This dataset is kind of cool.

{parent=SPARQL}

In this tutorial, we will use the &lt;Jena SPARQL hello world&gt; as a starting point. Tested on &lt;Apache Jena&gt; 4.10.0.

Basic query on \a[rdf/vcard.ttl] &lt;RDF Turtle&gt; data to find the person with full name "John Smith":
``
sparql --data=rdf/vcard.ttl --query=&lt;( printf '%s\n' 'SELECT ?x WHERE { ?x &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#FN&gt; "John Smith" }')
``
Output:
``
---------------------------------
| x                             |
=================================
| &lt;http://somewhere/JohnSmith/&gt; |
---------------------------------
``

To avoid writing `http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#` a billion times as queries grow larger, we can use the `PREFIX` syntax:
``
sparql --data=rdf/vcard.ttl --query=&lt;( printf '%s\n' '
PREFIX vc: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0#&gt;
SELECT ?x
WHERE { ?x vc:FN "John Smith" }
')
``
Output:
``

=================================

The &lt;CLI&gt; tools don't appear to be packaged for &lt;Ubuntu 23.10&gt;? Annoying... There is a package `libapache-jena-java` but it doesn't contain any binaries, only &lt;Java&gt; library files.

To run the CLI tools easily we can download the prebuilt:
``
sudo apt install openjdk-22-jre
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/jena/binaries/apache-jena-4.10.0.zip
unzip apache-jena-4.10.0.zip
cd apache-jena-4.10.0
export JENA_HOME="$(pwd)"
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"
``
and we can confirm it works with:
``
sparql -version
``
which outputs:
``
Apache Jena version 4.10.0
``

If your &lt;Java&gt; is too old then then running `sparql` with the prebuilts fails with:
``

``
sudo apt install maven openjdk-22-jdk
git clone https://github.com/apache/jena --branch jena-4.10.0 --depth 1
cd jena
mvn clean install
``
TODO test it.

If you make the mistake of trying to run the source tree without build:
``
git clone https://github.com/apache/jena --branch jena-4.10.0 --depth 1
cd jena
export JENA_HOME="$(pwd)"
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/apache-jena/bin"
``
it fails with:
