Mathematics is a &lt;art&gt;[beautiful game] played on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science[strings], which &lt;mathematicians&gt; call https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem["theorems"].

Here is a more understandable description of the semi-satire that follows: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/53969/what-does-formal-mean/3297537#3297537

You start with a very small list of:
* certain arbitrarily chosen initial strings, which mathematicians call "&lt;axioms&gt;"
* rules of how to obtain new strings from old strings, called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_inference["rules of inference"] Every transformation rule is very simple, and can be verified by a computer.

Using those rules, you choose a target string that you want to reach, and then try to reach it. Before the target string is reached, mathematicians call it a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture["conjecture"].

Mathematicians call the list of transformation rules used to reach a string a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof["proof"].

Since every step of the proof is very simple and can be verified by a computer automatically, the entire proof can also be automatically verified by a computer very easily.

Finding proofs however is undoubtedly an &lt;computable problem&gt;[uncomputable problem].

Most mathematicians can't code or deal with the real world in general however, so they haven't created the obviously necessary: &lt;website front-end for a mathematical formal proof system&gt;.

The fact that Mathematics happens to be the best way to describe &lt;physics&gt; and that humans can use physical intuition heuristics to reach the NP-hard proofs of mathematics is one of the great miracles of the universe.

Once we have mathematics formally modelled, one of the coolest results is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems[Gödel's incompleteness theorems], which states that for any reasonable proof system, there are necessarily theorems that cannot be proven neither true nor false starting from any given set of axioms: those theorems are independent from those axioms. Therefore, there are three possible outcomes for any hypothesis: true, false or independent!

Some famous theorems have even been proven to be independent of some famous &lt;axioms&gt;. One of the most notable is that the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis[Continuum Hypothesis] is &lt;independent (mathematical logic)&gt; from &lt;Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory&gt;! Such independence proofs rely on modelling the proof system inside another proof system, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)[forcing] is one of the main techniques used for this.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; asked: https://discord.com/channels/1096393420408360989/1096393420408360996/1137047842159079474
&gt; Does the website actually automatically check the formal proofs, or is this intended to be implemented at some point? And if yes, is it intended to allow proofs to depend on other proofs of the website (possibly by other people)
Owner:
&gt; Hi Ciro, yes we will be releasing in-browser proof assistant environments/checkers (e.g. Lean). Our goal is not to replace the underlying open-source repos (e.g. Mathlib) so the main dependency will be on the current repos; then when statement formalizations and proofs come in and are certified they can be PR'd to the respective repos. So we will be the source of truth for the informal latex code but only a stepping stone and orchestration layer on the way to the respective formal libraries.
So apparently there will be proof checking, but no dependencies between proofs, you still have to pull request everything back and face the pain.

Given stuff like https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12475.pdf on &lt;Erdős' conjecture on powers of 2&gt;, it feels like this one will be somewhere close to &lt;computer science&gt;/&lt;Halting problem&gt; issues than &lt;number theory&gt;.

{parent=Collatz conjecture}

= Shortcut Collatz function
{parent=Collatz function}

The &lt;Collatz function&gt; is not very elegant in that the odd $3n + 1$ case is always even because $n$ is odd, so it is always predictably followed by a division by two. This is not the case for the even case, where the result can be either even or odd.

A much more elegant formulation is to immediately also divide by two when the number is odd:
$$
\frac{3n + 1}{2}
$$

= Collatz conjecture failure mode

{parent=Collatz conjecture}

There are to ways in which the &lt;collatz conjecture&gt; can fail:
* &lt;Collatz cycle&gt;: there is a cycle that loops forever and never reaches 1
* &lt;Unbounded Collatz trajectory&gt;: there is a sequence that grows without bound without looping
These are the only two options because if any sequence has an upper bound, it must sooner or later repeat an element, leading to a cycle.

  * `{}` is an empty set. The natural number `0` is defined as `{}` as well.
  * `{{}}` is a set that contains an empty set
  * `{{}, {{}}}` is a set that contains two sets: `{}` and `{{}}`

The size of a set.

For &lt;finite&gt; sizes, the definition is simple, and the intuitive name "size" matches well.

But for infinity, things are messier, e.g. the size of the &lt;real numbers&gt; is strictly larger than the size of the &lt;integers&gt; as shown by &lt;Cantor's diagonal argument&gt;, which is kind of what justifies a fancier word "cardinality" to distinguish it from the more normal word "size".

The key idea is to compare set sizes with &lt;bijections&gt;.

Vs: &lt;image (mathematics)&gt;: the codomain is the set that the function might reach.

The &lt;image (mathematics)&gt; is the exact set that it actually reaches.

E.g. the function:
$$
f(x) = x^2
$$
could have:
* codomain $\R$
* image $\R_{+}$

Note that the definition of the codomain is somewhat arbitrary, e.g. $x^2$ could as well technically have codomain:
$$
\R \bigcup \R^2
$$
even though it will obviously never reach any value in $\R^2$.

The exact image is in general therefore harder to characterize.

= Taylor expansion definition of the exponential function
{c}
{parent=Definition of the exponential function}

The &lt;Taylor series&gt; expansion is the most direct definition of the expontial as it obviously satisfies the &lt;exponential function differential equation&gt;:
* the first constant term dies
* each other term gets converted to the one before
* because we have &lt;infinite&gt; many terms, we get what we started with!
$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + \frac{x}{1} + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{2 \times 3} + \frac{x^4}{2 \times 3 \times 4} + \ldots
$$

= Product definition of the exponential function
{parent=Definition of the exponential function}

$$
e^x = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1+\frac x n \right)^n
$$

The basic intuition for this is to start from the origin and make small changes to the function based on its known derivative at the origin.

More precisely, we know that for any base b, &lt;exponentiation&gt; satisfies:
* $b^{x + y} = b^x b^y$.
* $b^{0} = 1$.
And we also know that for $b = e$ in particular that we satisfy the &lt;exponential function differential equation&gt; and so:
$$
\dv{e^x}{x}(0) = 1
$$
One interesting fact is that the only thing we use from the &lt;exponential function differential equation&gt; is the value around $x = 0$, which is quite little information! This idea is basically what is behind the importance of the ralationship between &lt;Lie group-Lie algebra correspondence&gt; via the &lt;exponential map&gt;. In the more general settings of groups and &lt;manifolds&gt;, restricting ourselves to be near the origin is a huge advantage.

Now suppose that we want to calculate $e^1$. The idea is to start from $e^0$ and then then to use the first order of the &lt;Taylor series&gt; to extend the known value of $e^0$ to $e^1$.

E.g., if we split into 2 parts, we know that:
$$
e^1 = e^{1/2}e^{1/2}
$$
or in three parts:
$$
e^1 = e^{1/3}e^{1/3}e^{1/3}
$$
so we can just use arbitrarily many parts $e^{1/n}$ that are arbitrarily close to $x = 0$:
$$
e^1 = (e^{1/n})^n
$$
and more generally for any $x$ we have:
$$
e^x = (e^{x/n})^n
$$

Let's see what happens with the Taylor series. We have near $y = 0$ in &lt;little-o notation&gt;:
$$
e^y = 1 + y + o(y)
$$
Therefore, for $y = x/n$, which is near $y = 0$ for any fixed $x$:
$$
e^{x/n} = 1 + x/n + o(1/n)
$$
and therefore:
$$
e^x = (e^{x/n})^n = (1 + x/n + o(1/n))^n
$$
which is basically the formula tha we wanted. We just have to convince ourselves that at $\lim_{n \to \infty}$, the $o(1/n)$ disappears, i.e.:
$$
(1 + x/n + o(1/n))^n = (1 + x/n)^n
$$

To do that, let's multiply $e^y$ by itself once:
$$
e^y e^y = (1 + y + o(y))(1 + y + o(y)) = 1 + 2y + o(y)
$$
and multiplying a third time:
$$
e^y e^y e^y = (1 + 2y + o(y))(1 + y + o(y)) = 1 + 3y + o(y)
$$

The set of all &lt;algebraic numbers&gt; forms a &lt;field&gt;.

This field contains all of the &lt;rational numbers&gt;, but it is a &lt;quadratically closed field&gt;.

Like the &lt;rationals&gt;, this field also has the same &lt;cardinality&gt; as the &lt;natural numbers&gt;, because we can specify and enumerate each of its members by a fixed number of integers from the &lt;polynomial equation&gt; that defines them. So it is a bit like the &lt;rationals&gt;, but we use potentially arbitrary numbers of integers to specify each number (polynomial coefficients + index of which root we are talking about) instead of just always two as for the rationals.

Each &lt;algebraic number&gt; also has a degree associated to it, i.e. the &lt;degree of the polynomial&gt; used to define it.

= Domain of a polynomial
{parent=Polynomial}

= Polynomial over a field
{parent=Domain of a polynomial}
{title2=$Field[X]$}
{wiki}

By default, we think of polynomials over the &lt;real numbers&gt; or &lt;complex numbers&gt;.

However, a polynomial can be defined over any other field just as well, the most notable example being that of a polynomial over a &lt;finite field&gt;.

For example, given the finite field of &lt;order (algebra)&gt; 9, $GP(3)$ and with elements $\{0, 1, 2\}$, we can denote polynomials over that ring as
$$
GP(3)[x]
$$
where $x$ is the variable name.

For example, one such polynomial could be:
$$
P(x) = 2x^4 + x^2 + 2
$$
and another one:
$$
Q(X) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2
$$
Note how all the coefficients are members of the finite field we chose.

Given this, we could evaluate the polynomial for any element of the field, e.g.:
$$
P(0) = 2 (0 \times 0 \times 0 \times 0) + (0 \times 0) + 2 = 2
P(1) = 2 (1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1) + (1 \times 1) + 2 = 2 (1) + 1 + 2 = 2
P(2) = 2 (2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2) + (2 \times 2) + 2 = 2 (16 % 3) + (4 % 3) + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 2
$$
and so on.

We can also add polynomials as usual over the field:
$$
P(x) + Q(x) = 2x^4 + x^3 + (1+2)x^2 + (2 + 2) = 2x^4 + x^3 + (0)x^2 + 1 = 2x^4 + x^3 + 1
$$
and multiplication works analogously.

= Polynomial over a ring
{parent=Domain of a polynomial}
{wiki}

The usual definition of a &lt;polynomial&gt; is over a &lt;field (mathematics)&gt; as shown at &lt;polynomial over a field&gt;.

However, there is nothing in the immediate definition that prevents us from having a &lt;ring (mathematics)&gt; instead, i.e. a &lt;field (mathematics)&gt; but without the &lt;commutative property&gt; and &lt;inverse elements&gt;.

The only thing is that then we would need to differentiate between different orderings of the terms of &lt;multivariate polynomial&gt;, e.g. the following would all be potentially different terms:
$$
2xxy + 2xyx + 2yxx +
x2xy + x2yx + y2xx +
xx2y + xy2x + yx2x +
xxy2 + xyx2 + yxx2
$$
while for a field they would all go into a single term:
$$
12x^2y
$$
so when considering a polynomial over a &lt;ring (mathematics)&gt; we end up with a lot more more possible terms.

If the &lt;ring&gt; is a &lt;commutative ring&gt; however, polynomials do look like proper polynomials: &lt;Polynomial over a commutative ring&gt;{full}.

= Polynomial over a commutative ring
{parent=Domain of a polynomial}
{wiki}

Unlike &lt;Polynomial over a ring&gt;[over non-commutative rings], polynomials do look like proper &lt;polynomials&gt; over &lt;commutative ring&gt;.

In particular, &lt;Hilbert's tenth problem&gt; is about &lt;polynomials&gt; over the &lt;integers&gt;, which is a &lt;commutative ring&gt;, and therefore brings mindshare to this definition.

The generalized Kolakoski sequence is the generalization of the &lt;Kolakoski sequence&gt; where you don't need to restrict yourself to 1,2 but can instead use any a,b pair.

= Nilsson algorithm for the Kolakoski sequence
{c}
{parent=Kolakoski sequence}

This algorithm is more efficient in space, using only $log(n)$, as it recursively compresses the state required to keep track of what to do next.

Time is still $O(n)$.

The table at https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/pd/Kolakoski-UNSW.pdf page 20 has a summary image, but it is hard to understand.

Let's do a step by step version now.

The notation we use is as follows:
``
1 2 (1) 1 (1)
``
means that:
* this is number 2
* there is 1 occurrence count left

Note that column 1 does not need to keep a count so we use notation such as:

``
1 2(0) 1(1)
``

The starting state is:
``
2 | 2 2(1) 2(1) 2(1) 2(1) ...
``
which means that it implicitly contains infinitely many `2(1)` at the end which we abbreviate just as:
``
2 | 2 2(1) ...
``
The actual algorithm will of course omit as many trailing `2(1)` as it can.

The update rules are:
* go left to right:
  * flip:
    ``
    x(0)       y(0)
    !x((!x)-1) unchanged
    ``
    continue going left to right.
  * repeat:
    ``
    x(0)   y(n &gt; 0)
    x(x-1) y(n - 1)
    ``
    and then stop further updates.
Note that both rules don't overlap so that each update is always determined by only one of them at a time.

Also the first column is always implicitly `(0)`.

Use column 2 up once to repeat column 1:

``
2 | 2 2(1) ...
3 | 2 2(0) 2(1) ...
``

Here we:
* switch column 1 because column 2 reached 0 on previous step
* use column 3 up once to repeat column 2

``
2 | 2 2(1) ...
3 | 2 2(0) 2(1) ...
4 | 1 2(1) 2(0) 2(1) ...
``

* use column 2 up once to repeat 1

``
Furthermore, note that if `a = 1`, then the `a, b` sequence is a subset of the `b, a` sequence e.g.:
``
1, 2 = [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, ...]
2, 1 = [   2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, ...]
``
therefore we can always make `a` not be 1 by switching the pair and then using the generalized algorithm with `a != 1`.

= Reduced fraction
{parent=Fraction}

A "reduced fraction" is a fraction that has the smallest possible &lt;integer&gt; &lt;numerator&gt; and &lt;denominator&gt; for its value.

For example:
$$
\frac{3}{6}
$$
is not a reduced fraction, because there is another fraction equal to it but with smaller &lt;numerator&gt; and &lt;denominator&gt;:
$$
\frac{1}{2}
$$

Kind of extends the &lt;complex numbers&gt;.

Some facts that make them stand out:

* the simplest non-&lt;commutative&gt; &lt;division algebra&gt;. Contrast for example with &lt;complex numbers&gt; where multiplication is &lt;commutative&gt;

&lt;Sets&gt; are unordered, but we can use them to create ordered objects, which are of fundamental importance. Notably, they are used in the definition of &lt;functions&gt;.

= Logic
{parent=Formalization of mathematics}

{wiki}

This is the part of the &lt;formalization of mathematics&gt; that deals only with the propositions.

In some systems, e.g. including &lt;Metamath&gt;, &lt;modus ponens&gt; alone tends to be enough, everything else can be defined based on it.

{title2=$\exists$}
{wiki}

Models &lt;existence&gt; in the context of the &lt;formalization of mathematics&gt;.

= Existence and uniqueness
{parent=Existential quantification}
{wiki}

Existence and uniqueness results are fundamental in &lt;mathematics&gt; because we often define objects by their properties, and then start calling them "the object", which is fantastically convenient.

But calling something "the object" only makes sense if there exists exactly one, and only one, object that satisfies the properties.

One particular context where these come up very explicitly is in solutions to &lt;differential equations&gt;, e.g. &lt;existence and uniqueness of solutions of partial differential equations&gt;.
