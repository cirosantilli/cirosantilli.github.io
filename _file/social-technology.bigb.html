Rasselas Prince of Abyssinia CHAPTER VIII https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/652/pg652-images.html[]:
&gt; Oppression is, in the Abyssinian dominions, neither frequent nor tolerated; but no form of government has been yet discovered by which cruelty can be wholly prevented. Subordination supposes power on one part and subjection on the other; and if power be in the hands of men it will sometimes be abused. The vigilance of the supreme magistrate may do much, but much will still remain undone. He can never know all the crimes that are committed, and can seldom punish all that he knows.

= Electronic voting
{parent=Voting}
{wiki}

This is a must if the people want to regain control of their society from apathetic politicians.

I would also increase voter percentage due to convenience, and reduce the weight of voting fraud cases, as everyone would be able to check that their own vote was counted correctly.

And then, we would be able to have &lt;referendums&gt; for basically any important decision being made. No need to go out on the streets and waste your time in a mass protest! Just vote!

It is possible to implement anonymous electronic voting with &lt;ring signatures&gt;, an algorithm also used by &lt;Monero&gt;, an &lt;anonymity&gt; focused &lt;cryptocurrency&gt;, as mentioned e.g. on this 2004 paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/281.pdf[]. The system can be set in a way such that you can only deanonymize someone if everyone else, or a very large number of people, conspire against that person.

The same system could also be used to setup forums where only citizens of the country could comment and propose changes and vote on them.

With electronic voting, we could have a system where you can let someone you trust vote for you automatically, or vote automatically for certain subjects alone, a bit like we do by electing senators. But then you would also be able to override specific votes if you wanted to.

In this system therefore, anyone who can proxy vote has to have their vote public, and placed in a decent website that shows clearly who voted for what.

Why don't the poor vote in mass for it is incomprehensible considering e.g. the &lt;wealth inequality in the United States&gt; as of 2020!

(1999) by &lt;Adam Curtis&gt; explains nicely how in the 60's, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Slater_(accountant)[Jim Slater] bought stock of inefficient companies, and sold off inefficient assets to make a profit.

  He managed to do that because previously people had regarded those companies as family companies, and never looked into the fact that they families weren't actually majority shareholders anymore.

  While this increased efficiency, it also fired many people, and the government didn't manage to change legislation fast enough to &lt;tax&gt; those profits to increase welfare.

= Regulate the fuck out of advertising
{parent=Advertising}

It should be illegal to give someone money to advertise your product.

We should just use tags and upvote-based algorithms.

Advertisement is a form of &lt;brainwashing&gt;.

TODO find &lt;Sergey Brin&gt; quote bout advertising being a form of perverting search engine ranking neutrality. In other words, there are neutral metrics to what people find good, like links and upvotes. And then advertising is a way to pervert that to someone's profit.

Sometimes &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; thinks advertising should be on-subscription only, but that is too restrictive, e.g. imagine the local business owner who wears a t-shirt of their business.

= Social media feed that forces you to see posts by non-followed
{parent=Social media}

During the early 2020s, many of the idiotic social media platforms started adding a non optional "feature" of suggesting feed posts by people you don't follow:
* &lt;Twitter&gt;: TODO forgot year
* &lt;LinkedIn&gt;: 2023
  * https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/16f71lx/how_do_i_stop_seeing_suggested_posts_in_my_feed/
  * https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nate-sullivan-15232018_is-there-a-way-to-turn-off-suggested-posts-activity-7087888795370430464-yZaN/
  OK, set "Most recent posts" on "Feed preferences" and it seems to work.
* &lt;How to view only posts by followed on Facebook feed?&gt;

It must have been some A/B testing overload that made that decision to try and make things more addictive for everyone. Or perhaps as a way to drive revenue with people paying to cheat the algorithm and boost their posts.

Of course those racist &lt;Nazis&gt; are a bunch of idiots, but how can you be surprised when freedom-of-speech focused tech gets used by them? https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking

Obviously, a few large instances dominate the user base for all practical purposes: https://kevq.uk/centralisation-and-mastodon/[]. And likely the network splits into hate-speech/non-hate-speech blacklist boundaries. And since the dominating closed networks will never lose user counts (???), the only instance that dominates will be the main hate speech one.

The flagship instance was https://mastodon.social[] and then in 2020 they closed signups for it and created a secondary https://mastodon.online[].

The multi-instance thing is confusing and problematic. E.g. replies and likes might not show up across instances in some occasions: https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/comments/ynt7ta/is_there_a_way_to_see_post_replies_displayed_on/

The "advanced interface" feature is bad. Really bad. &lt;MacOS&gt; file browser inspired.

It is hard to understand what the point of that website is, as it is basically just a more closed version of &lt;Facebook&gt;, but alas, it has flourished as the only place where people post more useful content compared to &lt;Twitter&gt; and &lt;Facebook&gt;. In any case, Ciro just applies the same unfollow policy to all of them: &lt;aggressively filter your social media follows&gt;.

Data that is inscribed in a blockchain as a way to perpetuate the data, rather than to follow the main intended purpose of the given &lt;blockchain&gt;, e.g. &lt;ASCII art&gt; instead of financial transactions on the &lt;Bitcoin blockchain&gt;.

{parent=Inscription (blockchain)}

A "miner message" is an &lt;inscription (blockchain)&gt; message left by a &lt;Cryptocurrency mining&gt;[miner] on a &lt;blockchain&gt;.

This is opposed to messages that may be left by non miners during transactions.

Miner messages are therefore of course much harder to control on established blockchains, as they basically require consensus in a &lt;mining pool&gt; to set. Most of them are just ads for the &lt;mining pool&gt; itself.

* there are some examples that came earlier than those in the &lt;Bitcoin&gt; blockchain, notably a bit earlier than &lt;Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain/BitLen&gt;{full}
* &lt;Namecoin&gt; is a &lt;NFT&gt; system unlike &lt;Bitcoin&gt; which is fungible, so those assets are naturally tradable

= Electronic money
{parent=Digital currency}

Our minimal definition of "electronic money" is the following.

Instead of creating &lt;legal tender&gt; such as &lt;Dollars&gt; as banknotes or transactions in some complex obscure banking system, the &lt;government&gt; offers an official simple centralized API that represents it instead.

Each citizen or legal entity has an account there, and transfers between registered users are just simple API calls.

 So for example you would e able to put all your money in the government account instead of using useless banks. And then you would invest it as you want with the investment company of your choice, without tying the "my money is here" with "this is the best investment" aspects of banks.

= GNU Taler
{c}
{parent=Electronic money}
{tag=GNU package}

Centralized system that still attempts some level of privacy.

In it, a central bank issue tokens that are stored offline in your cell phone, a bit like cash bank notes.

When you take those tokens, a corresponding amount gets removed from your bank account, a bit like cash bank notes.

When a transaction is made, tokens are put into a spent token list via central API, and cannot be double spent thereafter. The corresponding ammount is then added to the bank account of the receiver. This also means that offline transactions are not possible.

When emitting, the bank signs the token with their private key. When spending, the bank checks that signature.

How do we prevent the bank from logging which token goes to which user besides trusting that they are running the software we whink they are running? Notably, couldn't timing be used to identify that?

Follows the "certified teacher only" approach which is in &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s opinion a fatal flaw of most elearning systems out there, &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt; won't suffer from that!

But that is a very, very good project.

All notes appear to have been extracted from existing notes, as noted on the bottom of each page.

Appears to have mixed licenses. E.g.:
* https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Book%3A_University_Physics_III_-_Optics_and_Modern_Physics_(OpenStax)/06%3A_Photons_and_Matter_Waves/6.06%3A_De_Broglies_Matter_Waves is &lt;CC BY&gt;
* but we had seen another one that was &lt;CC BY-NC-SA&gt;
* https://phys.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD%3A_Physics_9HE_-_Modern_Physics/06%3A_Emission_and_Absorption_of_Photons/6.1%3A_Transitions_Between_Stationary_States &lt;CC BY-SA&gt;
* https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Introductory_Chemistry_(CK-12) uses the custom "CK-12 license" which seems a bit like &lt;CC BY-NC-SA&gt;
* some don't even have a &lt;free license&gt;, e.g.: https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Quantum_Mechanics/Quantum_Mechanics_(Fowler)/00%3A_Front_Matter/04%3A_Licensing

TODO how does it work exactly? Do they ask for permission from authors in every case, including when the content has &lt;open license&gt;? Or when it has open license, do they just do it? In some cases, the notes have no license, so they must have asked.

TODO what is the source code that authors write? &lt;LaTeX&gt; or something else? &lt;LaTeX&gt; feels extremely likely given that it is what most original materials were already written in.

They are attempting a "model up this entire university" thing: https://phys.libretexts.org/Courses which is good. E.g. they have a bunch of "quantum mechanics ones under: https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Quantum_Mechanics

Appears to be &lt;UC Davies&gt;-based mostly.

They claim to use this closed source backend: https://www.nice.com/resources/cxone-expert-knowledge-management[]? Seriously? For a publicly funded project with low-tech requirements?? It is &lt;mind blowing&gt;.

Some issues:
* the internal cross references are somewhat broken as of 2022.
* their URLs are HUGE! All components of every ancestor are in it. E.g. check this out: https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Quantum_Mechanics/Introductory_Quantum_Mechanics_(Fitzpatrick)/12%3A_Time-Dependent_Perturbation_Theory/12.13%3A_Forbidden_Transitions Insane.

This is an interesting initiative which has some similarities to &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s &lt;OurBigBook&gt; project.

The fatal flaw of the initiative in &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s opinion is the lack of &lt;#user-generated content&gt;. We will never get there without UGC and algorithms, never.

Also as of 2021, it mostly useless business courses: https://learn.saylor.org unfortunately.

But it has several redeeming factors which Ciro Santilli aproves of:
* &lt;exam as a service&gt;-like
* they have a &lt;GitHub&gt;: https://github.com/saylordotorgo

Licensing appears to be a mixed mess between the dreaded &lt;CC BY-NC-SA&gt; and the good &lt;CC BY&gt;, e.g.:
* https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_introduction-to-economic-analysis/s00-license.html is &lt;CC BY-NC-SA&gt;

* https://www.michael.com/ yes, he is Michael.com lol. When did he get the domain, and at what price? He's mildlly obsessed with domain names it seems: https://www.domainsherpa.com/saylor/[]. He also bought `frank.com`, `mike.com`. `emma.com`. This was between 1994 and 2000. He mentions that his email is `saylor@strategy.com`. `strategy.com` redirects to `microstrategy.com` as of 2022, so seems still valid.

  We actually got a backlink from https://tvt.phishlabs.com[] to this page in August 2022, a &lt;phising&gt; security provider, presumably for showing his email here. This reminds Ciro of the &lt;All GitHub Commit Emails&gt; event!

  A quick google for that address also leads to https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/liveonline/00/business/saylor0621.htm[], a year 2000 profile page by the Washington Post, followed by a Q&amp;A. In the Q&amp;A, Michael himself gives his email in relation to &lt;Saylor Academy&gt;:
  &gt; Kensington, Maryland: What has happened to your vision of an internet university? I believe it is an important initiative and it doesn't require \$100 million to get started. We at the &lt;Rockefeller Foundation&gt; would like to become involved. How can we do this?

    Michael Saylor: The internet university is alive and well. My goal is to initially roll out a cyber-libary of digital video that can be used by any for-profit or non-profit organization in order to accelerate the free education initiative. Eventually, people may just go direct to the web site.

    I think the entire thing will unfold over about 10 years.

    Send me an email if you would like to get involved. (saylor@strategy.com)
  so it was already beyond leaked. Ciro did hit that email address seeking funding for &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt;, but no reply unfortunately. Maybe you gotta be part of the Rockefeller family to get a reply from these people? Well, at least this led to Ciro learning about the Rockefeller Foundation.

Generally, prizes that pay big lumps of money to well established individuals are a bit useless, it would be better to pay smaller sums to struggling beginners in the field, of which there are aplenty.

The most important part about prizes should not be the money, nor the recognition, but rather explaining better what the laureates did. In this, most prizes fail. Thus &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s project idea: &lt;Project to explain each Nobel Prize better&gt;.

= Knowledge olympiads
{synonym}

E.g. &lt;#International Mathematical Olympiad&gt;, &lt;#International Physics Olympiad&gt;, &lt;competitive programming&gt;, etc.

Events that trick young kids into thinking that they are making progress, but only serve to distract them from what really matters, which is to dominate a &lt;state of the art&gt; as fast as possible, contact researches in the area, and publish truly &lt;novel results&gt;.

Financially backed by high schools trying to make ads showing how they will turn your kids into geniuses (but also passionate teachers who fell into this hellish system), or companies who hire machines rather than entrepreneurs.

The most triggering thing possible is when programming competitions don't release their benchmarks as &lt;open source software&gt; afterwards: at least like that they might help someone to solve their real world problems. Maybe.

Some https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artur_Avila[irrelevant people] highlight https://youtu.be/jz-41LxrI_M?t=46[that knowledge Olympiads can have good effects], because they are "an opportunity to meet university teachers and their research organizations". Ciro's argument is just that there are much more efficient ways to achieve those goals.

As an alternative way to get into university, this is not 100% horrible however, e.g. the &lt;University of São Paulo&gt; accepted students from olympiads in 2019 and then again 2023: https://jornal.usp.br/institucional/usp-oferece-200-vagas-em-mais-de-100-cursos-de-graduacao-para-alunos-participantes-de-olimpiadas-do-conhecimento/?a

Resources to study for &lt;knowledge olympiads&gt;:
* https://savchenkosolutions.com contains collaboratively created solutions to the Savchenko Problems in Physics. It appears to be a frontend for: https://github.com/savchenko-physics/savchenko-solutions[]. Closed license, kind of sad.

= Hackathon
{parent=Knowledge olympiad}

Hackathons are useless.

If you have a useful project, why would you ever restrict its development to a specific timeframe and with a specific set of contributors?

Just put your project on &lt;GitHub&gt; and promote it to try and get users and contributors instead!

Instead of announcing organizing hackathons, people should just curate forums where people with similar interests can talk to one another instead, to find new projects that might interest one another.

Restricting intensive development to a few days tends to produce crappy code and not reach real goals.

If your kids are about to starve, fine, do it.

But otherwise, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; will not, ever, spend his time drilling programmer competition problems to join a &lt;company&gt;, life is too short for that.

Life is too short for that. Companies must either notice that you can make amazing &lt;open source software&gt; projects or contributions, and hire you for that, or they must &lt;fuck&gt; off.

Days of the week where you don't do what you set out to do. And yet, it is in those days that you save your sanity, and possibly the world. Wait, this sounds exactly like a week day?
