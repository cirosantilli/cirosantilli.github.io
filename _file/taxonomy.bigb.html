TODO vs &lt;Phylogenetic tree&gt;? https://www.visiblebody.com/blog/phylogenetic-trees-cladograms-and-how-to-read-them[]:
&gt; Cladograms and phylogenetic trees are functionally very similar, but they show different things. Cladograms do not indicate time or the amount of difference between groups, whereas phylogenetic trees often indicate time spans between branching points.

When a characteristic is basal, it basically means the opposite of it being &lt;polyphyletic&gt;.

E.g. &lt;monotremes&gt; laying eggs did not evolve separately after function loss, it comes directly from &lt;reptiles&gt;.

* &lt;multicellularity&gt;: evolved a bunch of times

The cool thing about &lt;parallel evolution&gt; is that it shows how complex &lt;phenotype&gt; can evolve from very different initial genetic conditions, highlighting the great power of &lt;evolution&gt;.

= Taxonomic rank
{parent=Taxonomy}
{wiki}

Naming taxonomic ranks like &lt;genus&gt;, &lt;domain (biology)&gt;, etc. is a fucking waste of time, only useful before we developed &lt;molecular biology&gt;.

All that matters is the tree of &lt;clades&gt; with examples of species in each clade, and common characteristics shared by the clade.

And with &lt;molecular biology&gt;, we can build those trees incredibly well for &lt;extant&gt; species. When &lt;extinct&gt; species are involved however, things get more complicated.

This mess is because people don't realize that &lt;clades&gt; are all that really matter.

It is quite mind blowing when you think about it, that the huge majority of your body's cells is essentially just there to support a tiny ammount of germline, which are the only cells that can actually pass on! It is fun to imagine the &lt;cell type tree&gt; for this, with a huge branching of somatic cells, and only a few germline going forward.

It is hard to distinguish between colonies of &lt;unicellular organism&gt; and &lt;multicellular organism&gt; as there is a continuum between both depending on how well integrated they cells are.

COVID happens in two stages:
* viral infection
* &lt;inflammatory&gt; phase, where the body takes over, and sometimes harms itself. It seems that people are not generally contagious at this point?

This distinction is one of the reasons why separating the virus name (SARS-CoV-2) from the disease makes sense: the disease is much broader than the viral infection.

= Why it takes several days to enter inflammatory phase in COVID-19?
{parent=COVID-19}
{wiki}

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7247969/

Why is it there such a clear separation of phases?

Why do people with mild symptoms go on to die? It is a great mystery.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s theory is that COVID is extremely effective at avoiding &lt;immune response&gt;. Then, in people where this is effective, things reach a point where there is so much virus, that the body notices and moves on to take a more drastic approach. This is compatible with the virus killing older people more, as they have weaker immunes systems. This is however incompatible with the fact that people don't seem to be contagious after the viral phase is over...

20 minutes in optimal conditions, with a crazy multiple start sites mechanism: &lt;E. Coli starts DNA replication before the previous one finished&gt;.

Otherwise, naively, would take 60-90 minutes just to replicate and segregate the full DNA otherwise. So it starts copying multiple times.

https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?type=EXTRAGENIC-SITE&amp;object=G0-10506[] explains:
&gt; This site is the origin of replication of the E. coli chromosome. It contains the binding sites for DnaA, which is critical for initiation of replication. Replication proceeds bidirectionally. For historical reasons, the numbering of E. coli's &lt;circular chromosome&gt; does not start at the &lt;origin of replication&gt;, but at the origin of transfer during conjugation.
If it is a bit hard to understand what they mean by "origin of transfer" though, as that term is usually associated with the &lt;origin of transfer&gt; of &lt;bacterial conjugation&gt;.

At only 65 bp, this gene is quite small and boring. For a more interesting gene, have a look at the next gene, &lt;e. Coli K-12 MG1655 gene thrA&gt;.

Does something to do with &lt;threonine&gt;.

This is the first in the sequence thrL, thrA, thrB, thrC. This type of naming convention is quite common on related adjacent proteins, all of which must be getting &lt;transcribed (biology)&gt; into a single &lt;RNA&gt; by the same &lt;promoter (genetics)&gt;. As mentioned in the analysis of the &lt;KEGG&gt; entry for &lt;e. Coli K-12 MG1655 gene thrA&gt;, those A, B and C are actually directly functionally linked in a direct &lt;metabolic pathway&gt;.

Part of a reaction that produces &lt;threonine&gt;.

This &lt;protein&gt; is an &lt;enzyme&gt;. The &lt;UniProt&gt; entry clearly shows the &lt;chemical reactions&gt; that it &lt;catalyses&gt;. In this case, there are actually two! It can either transforming the &lt;metabolite&gt;:
* "L-homoserine" into "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde"
* "L-aspartate" into "4-phospho-L-aspartate"
Also interestingly, we see that both of those reaction require some extra energy to catalyse, one needing &lt;adenosine triphosphate&gt; and the other &lt;nADP+&gt;.

TODO: any mention of how much faster it makes the reaction, numerically?

Since this is an &lt;enzyme&gt;, it would also be interesting to have a quick search for it in the &lt;KEGG&gt; entry starting from the organism: https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco01100+M00022 We type in the search bar "thrA", it gives a long list, but the last entry is our "thrA". Selecting it highlights two pathways in the large &lt;graph&gt;, so we understand that it catalyzes two different reactions, as suggested by the protein name itself (fused blah blah). We can now hover over:
* the &lt;edge (graph)&gt;: it shows all the enzymes that catalyze the given reaction. Both edges actually have multiple enzymes, e.g. the L-Homoserine path is also catalyzed by another enzyme called metL.
* the &lt;node (graph)&gt;: they are the &lt;metabolites&gt;, e.g. one of the paths contains "L-homoserine" on one node and "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde"
Note that common &lt;cofactor (biochemistry)&gt; are omitted, since we've learnt from the UniProt entry that this reaction uses ATP.

If we can now click on the L-Homoserine edge, it takes us to: https://www.genome.jp/entry/eco:b0002+eco:b3940[]. Under "Pathway" we see an interesting looking pathway "Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism": https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260+b0002 which contains a small manually selected and extremely clearly named subset of the larger graph!

But looking at the bottom of this subgraph (the UI is not great, can't Ctrl+F and enzyme names not shown, but the selected enzyme is slightly highlighted in red because it is in the URL https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260+b0002[] vs https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260[]) we clearly see that thrA, thrB and thrC for a sequence that directly transforms "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde" into "Homoserine" to "O-Phospho-L-homoserine" and finally to&lt;threonine&gt;. This makes it crystal clear that they are not just located adjacently in the genome by chance: they are actually functionally related, and likely controlled by the same transcription factor: when you want one of them, you basically always want the three, because you must be are lacking &lt;threonine&gt;. TODO find transcription factor!

The UniProt entry also shows an interactive browser of the &lt;tertiary structure&gt; of the protein. We note that there are currently two sources available: &lt;X-ray crystallography&gt; and &lt;AlphaFold&gt;. To be honest, the &lt;AlphaFold&gt; one looks quite off!!!

By inspecting the &lt;FASTA&gt; for the entire genome, or by using the &lt;NCBI open reading frame tool&gt;, we see that this gene lies entirely in its own &lt;open reading frame&gt;, so it is quite boring

From the &lt;FASTA&gt; we see that the very first three &lt;Codons&gt; at position 337 are
``
ATG CGA GTG
``
where `ATG` is the &lt;start codon&gt;, and CGA GTG should be the first two that actually go into the protein:
* CGA: &lt;arginine&gt;
* GTG: &lt;valine&gt;

https://ecocyc.org/gene?orgid=ECOLI&amp;id=ASPKINIHOMOSERDEHYDROGI-MONOMER[] mentions that the enzime is most active as &lt;protein complex&gt; with four copies of the same protein:
&gt; Aspartate kinase I / homoserine dehydrogenase I comprises a &lt;protein dimer&gt;[dimer] of ThrA dimers. Although the dimeric form is catalytically active, the binding equilibrium dramatically favors the tetrameric form. The aspartate kinase and homoserine dehydrogenase activities of each ThrA monomer are catalyzed by independent domains connected by a linker region.

* https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?object=TU00178
we understand that the presence of &lt;threonine&gt; or &lt;isoleucine&gt; variants, L-threonyl and L-isoleucyl, makes the &lt;rho-independent termination&gt; become more efficient, so the control loop is quite direct! Not sure why it cares about &lt;isoleucine&gt; as well though.

Has one of the smallest genomes known, and &lt;JCVI&gt; made a minimized strain with 473 genes: &lt;JCVI-syn3.0&gt;.

The reason why genitalium has such a small genome is that &lt;parasites tend to have smaller DNAs&gt;. So it must be highlighted that genitalium can only survive in highly enriched environments, it can't even make its own &lt;amino acids&gt;, which it normally obtains fromthe host cells! And because it cannot do &lt;cellular respiration&gt;, it very likely replicates slower than say &lt;E. Coli&gt;. It's easy to be small in such scenarios!

&lt;Power, Sex, Suicide by Nick Lane (2006)&gt; section "How to lose the cell wall without dying" page 184 has some related mentions puts it well very:
&gt; One group, the Mycoplasma, comprises mostly parasites, many of which live inside other cells. Mycoplasma cells are tiny, with very small genomes. &lt;M. genitalium&gt;, discovered in 1981, has the smallest known genome of any bacterial cell, encoding fewer than  genes. Despite its simplicity, it ranks among the most common of sexually transmitted diseases, producing symptoms similar to Chlamydia infection. It is so small (less than a third of a micron in diameter, or an order of magnitude smaller than most bacteria) that it must normally be viewed under the &lt;electron microscope&gt;; and difﬁculties culturing it meant its signiﬁcance was not appreciated until the important advances in gene sequencing in the early 1990s. Like Rickettsia, Mycoplasma have lost virtually all the genes required for making &lt;nucleotides&gt;, &lt;amino acids&gt;, and so forth. Unlike Rickettsia, however, Mycoplasma have also lost all the genes for oxygen respiration, or indeed any other form of membrane respiration: they have no cytochromes, and so must rely on &lt;fermentation&gt; for energy.

Downsides mentioned at https://youtu.be/PSDd3oHj548?t=293[]:
* too small to see on light microscope
* difficult to genetically manipulate. TODO why?

&gt; CVI-syn3B strains differ from &lt;JCVI-syn3.0&gt; by the presence of 19 additional non-essential genes that result in a more easily manipulated cell. JCVI-syn3B additionally includes a dual loxP landing pad that enables easy Cre recombinase mediated insertion of genes
It is also interesting to see how they are interested in co-culture with &lt;HeLa&gt; cells, presumably to enable infectious bacterial disease studies.

{parent=Archaea}

&lt;Archaea&gt; are much more closely related to the &lt;eukaryotes&gt; than &lt;bacteria&gt;, see e.g. &lt;image Coral of life by János Podani (2019)&gt; which shows how &lt;archaea&gt; diverged from eukarya almost 2 By after &lt;LUCA&gt;!

It therefore appears that the &lt;mitochondrial endosymbiosis&gt; happened when a &lt;bacteria&gt; like cell joined up with an &lt;archaea&gt;.

Some notable points in which &lt;archaea&gt; look more like &lt;eukaryotes&gt; than &lt;bacteria&gt;:
* although they don't have a &lt;cell nucleus&gt;, they do have &lt;histones&gt;! Mentioned at:

&lt;Power, Sex, Suicide by Nick Lane (2006)&gt; page 53 suggests that one tremendous advantage of &lt;eukaryotes&gt; over &lt;bacteria&gt; is their ability to change shape due to the presence of the &lt;cytoskeleton&gt;, and the lack of a rigid &lt;bacterial cell wall&gt;.

Imagine in a world where there are only &lt;bacteria&gt;, and you can eat entire bacteria in one go, what a huge advantage that is!

This group is a mess.

But one thing you should really know, as often mentioned in &lt;Power, Sex, Suicide by Nick Lane (2006)&gt;: they are all &lt;eukaryotes&gt;.

Because &lt;prokaryotes&gt; are fundamentally unable to do &lt;phagocytosis&gt;, because they have a rigid &lt;cell wall&gt;. Changing cell shape at will requires a &lt;cytoskeleton&gt;.

The big breakthrough of the vertebrates appears to be the ability to swim around in a straight line and eat smaller species that are floating about.

&lt;Bones&gt; appear to help that a lot!

It is likely the most efficient design to travel long distances. Be thin and wiggle your tail around.

Perhaps smaller &lt;animals&gt; can skip the bone thing. Maybe a notable example are the &lt;lancelets&gt;, which look a bit like small fish. But they only go up to 8 cm.

Eggs are &lt;basal (phylogenetics)&gt;: they simply didn't evolve out of what other &lt;reptiles&gt; do. From which we conclude that &lt;milk&gt; came before &lt;eggs&gt; stopped.

So this is the most basal subclade of mammals.

Etymology: means "single hole" in &lt;Greek (language)&gt;, because like other &lt;reptiles&gt; it has a single hole for &lt;shit&gt;, &lt;pee&gt; and &lt;fucking&gt;: the &lt;cloaca&gt;.

This looks a lot like the beans that &lt;Brazilians&gt; venerate and can be easily found in the &lt;United Kingdom&gt; as of 2020.

The more exact type seems to be &lt;pinto bean&gt;, but this is close enough.

2021-03: same but 2.5 teaspons, seems to be the right ammount.

2021-02-10: attempt 3: 500g 1 hour 30 minutes no pressure, uncontrolled water. Salt with one chorizo: put 3 teaspoons, it was a bit too much, going to do 2 next time and see.

2020-12-14: attempt 3: 250g of beans, 1.5l of water, 30 minutes pressure.

2020-11-30: attempt 2: 275ml of dry beans, about 50% of 500g bag, putting 1650 ml (6x) of water on pressure cooker Still had to throw out some water.

Density dry raw: 216 g/250 ml = 432 g / 500 ml = 500 g / 580 ml = 864 g/L

500 g dry expands to in water after 12 hours: 1200 ml

Therefore 500 g dry = 864 / 2 L = 432 ml expands about 3x.

Therefore, to the maximum 2.5L of the cooker with 8x https://www.oliviascuisine.com/brazilian-style-beans/[dry volume water from this recipe] I can use:
``
2500 = volume expanded bean + volume water = 3 volume dry bean + 8 volume dry bean = 11 volume dry bean
``
and so:
``
volume dry bean = 2500/11 = 227ml
``
which is about 227 / 580 = 40% of the 500 g bag.

After first try, I found that 8x volume of water is way, way too much. Going to try 6x next time.

Edit: after buying it, not 100% sure. This one felt smaller than what Ciro had in Brazil, &lt;borlotti beans&gt; might be closer. Pinto beans are smaller, and creamier, and have softer peel, possibly produced less &lt;fart&gt;[natural gas].

2021-04: second try.

2021-03: did for first time, started with same procedure as &lt;borlotti beans&gt; 2021-03. Maybe 1h30 is too much. Outcome was still very good.
