&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; was touched by this, and then watched several other documentaries by Curtis.

Part of Ciro asks if it is all a big conspiracy theory. But it feels and sounds so right.

Notably the part of the &lt;governments have lost all power to companies&gt;, and can't do anything meaningful anymore to actually represent the people, because &lt;globalization reduces the power of governments&gt;.

Great reports to how 2022-&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; views how &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt; could go. Ciro can't help to feel that he is a mixture of both of the vision, tech and people guy. Not as extreme as any of them, but more like a well rounded (and less good individually) version of each. &lt;High flying bird vs gophers&gt;.

This is a &lt;neologism&gt; by &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;, it refers to the fact that &lt;Zatoichi&gt; was not fully blind, but extremely hard of sight, which makes him:
* too capable for the blind people, who did not trust him
* too incapable for non-blind people, who despised him
and metaphorically refers to similar situations where a person or group of people are in the middle of two groups and not part of either of them.

A related thing that comes to mind is &lt;Aum Shinrikyo&gt;'s &lt;Prophet&gt; &lt;Shoko Asahara&gt;, who was semi blind, and would bully the fully blind people of his school for blind people.

And by artificial intelligence, read of course (non-human-identical) &lt;artificial general intelligence&gt;.

Today-2022, this is placed under the &lt;science fiction film&gt; category. But maybe this might change during &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s own lifetime?

The basic criteria of "is a film about artificial intelligence good or not" to &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; is: does the AI inhabit humanoid, or fully human looking, bodies? Bodies is a bad sign due to:
* &lt;the best science fiction works deeply explore the consequences of one single technology&gt;: efficient humanoid bodies are a second technological breakthrough besides AI itself. The first AI will obviously be a supercomputer without a body
* it is hard to imagine that the AI wouldn't organize itself as one huge central computer and R&amp;D/command center. Perhaps there will be need for a few separate ones to optimize usage of natural resources, and to have some redundance in case a nuke blows the region, but there would be very very few of the think tanks. But having big centers is fundamental, because you centralize all the flow of ideas and their combination leading to new better outcomes for the AI. The mobile robot actors controlled by this center, if any exist, would then be slaves with some degree of autonomy and infinitely less computational powerful than the think tank.

That makes &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; most mad about this film is the fact that the dude was passionate about writing, and when he became a &lt;genius&gt;, rather than write the best novels ever written, he decided instead to play the &lt;stock market&gt; instead. This paints an accurate picture of 2020's society, where finance jobs make infinitely more money than other real engineering jobs, and end up attracting much of the talent.

Another enraging thing is how his girlfriend starts liking him again once he is a genius, and instead of telling her to fuck off, he stays with her.

The other really bad thing is the ending. He fixed the drug by himself? He scared off De Niro just like that?

All action scenes are useless crap, but the premise with Ciro's precious &lt;simulation hypothesis&gt; subject, related &lt;physics and the illusion of life&gt;.

It is a shame that the key premise of using human bodies to produce energy is completely and impossibly stupid. You would obviously get more energy by directing burning the food you feed into humans.

If the film had been made later, maybe the much more plausible concept of &lt;AI alignment&gt; would would have been used instead. What a shame.

{parent=Science fiction film}
{tag=Good film}
{wiki=Transcendence_(2014_film)}

The premise that "we can't make &lt;AGI&gt;, but we know enough about the &lt;human brain&gt; to upload on to a computer" is flawed. Edit: after reading &lt;Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom (2014)&gt;, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; was convinced otherwise. What is flawed is of course just the "extracting &lt;connectome&gt; with macroscopic probes part". A &lt;post mortem connectome extraction with microtome&gt; is much more believable. But of course they weren't going to show fake slices of Jonny Depp's brain, are they? Famous actor bodies are sacred! What a huge lost opportunity. On the other hand however, the scale of the first &lt;connectome&gt; extraction would be arguably too huge to be undertaken by a random pair of rogue researchers. The same would also likely apply to any first time human brain connectome. It would much more likely be a huge public effort, much like the &lt;Human Genome Project&gt;.

But this film does have the merit of exploring how an AGI might act to take over the AGI might act to take over the world once created, notably by creating its own physical research laboratory. Though it doesn't feel likely that it could go under the radar for 2 years given the energetic requirements of the research. Even the terrorists find it before the &lt;FBI&gt;!

I also wish they had shown the &lt;dildo&gt; (or more likely, direct stimulation!) computerized Jonny Depp used to use with his wife before he managed to re-synthesized his body. But you know, 18+ would cut too much profits. Ah, what a shame.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; has already watched all &lt;the best films of all time&gt;[the best films in history], and as a result any of those new movies that is full of clichés and has no innovative aspect at all (99.99999% of all modern movies) makes Ciro want to puke and to start &lt;Googling&gt; &lt;TV Tropes&gt; to classify as many clichés as possible.

Good movies are those that teach you mechanisms of the real world. https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief[Willing suspension of disbelief] must be maintained at all costs.

Or of what could happen a world where a single sci-fi element is added and explored to its limits.

Love is not an interesting aspect of the world. You solve your love life &lt;ourbigbook.com/motivation&gt;[at university], Tinder or Tango.

The actually interesting aspects of the world are:
* &lt;business film&gt;
* war
* &lt;crime film&gt;[crime]
* government
* science

Movies with a lot of action scenes, with exception of some war movies, are &lt;shit&gt;.

The &lt;Sliding scale of idealism vs. cynicism&gt; must be close to Cynicism max at all times. Movies with pure good and pure bad are &lt;shit&gt;.

Knowing spoilers has no effect in the film's enjoyment. The interest of storyline concepts is all that matters, visuals and acting are useless.

In a multi-language film, when two foreign characters speak English to each other when they obviously would have spoken their native language, that is a crime. Original language + subtitles is a must!

= High budget movies are shit
{parent=Ciro Santilli's film tastes}

Movies that are very expensive to make tend to be bad, because they have to make returns and thus appeal to a large amorphous population without any specialization, i.e. the &lt;lowest common denominator&gt; but in &lt;TV Tropes&gt; terminology rather than &lt;mathematics&gt;: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator[].

See e.g.:
* &lt;Primer (2004)&gt;

There's nothing like seeing the hypocrisy of the &lt;France&gt;["Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité"] people destroyed.

Interesting how Algeria now supports https://www.france24.com/en/20190712-37-countries-defend-china-over-xinjiang-un-letter[China's Xinjiang policy in 2019]. But of course, https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/dictatorships-tend-to-work-together[dictatorships tend to work together]

&lt;Ciro Santilli's father&gt;, an avid history reader, and in particular interested in the &lt;military dictatorship in Brazil&gt; through which he lived, once told Ciro how the French torture doctrine was directly adopted by Brazillian military, e.g. then even invited general Paul Aussaresses who had served in Algeria, to help them out with &lt;espionage&gt;[intelligence] operations and give courses. Bro, &lt;fuck&gt; that.

But of course, the &lt;Americans&gt; https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/guantanamo-bay[weren't too far behind in Guantanamo].

Many bad films have good aspects. They just didn't cross the elusive threshold of a &lt;good film&gt;.

The organic &lt;Usenet&gt; origins are quite hardcore!
