Of course, this only made sense when Apple was more of an underdog to &lt;IBM&gt;, and &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; greatly &lt;Ciro Santilli's self perceived creative personality&gt;[admires their defiance of the norm].

As of 2020 however, &lt;Apple&gt; is kind of on the top of the mobile world, and Think different simply makes no sense anymore, notably because it relies on &lt;closed source offline software used by millions&gt;.

&lt;it's Popular Now It Sucks&gt; comes to mind.

This is a trap every company that prides itself on it's "alternative culture" sets for itself. If they succeed, they could become the norm.

Nice looking and expensive operating system by &lt;Apple&gt;. &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; believes that:
* if you want to be ripped off, just use &lt;Microsoft Windows&gt; which has more software available
* or if you want to attain &lt;ourbigbook.com/motivation&gt;[Enlightenment], just use &lt;Linux&gt;, which is free and open source

The story of how OS X was ported to x86 from PowerPC with large initial work up to boot by a single man in the year 2000, John Kullmann, is really worth reading: https://www.quora.com/Apple-company/How-does-Apple-keep-secrets-so-well/answer/Kim-Scheinberg on &lt;Quora&gt;, see also:

{title=The Sad Story of Apple's Third Co-Founder by ColdFusion (2022)}

= Steve Jobs
{c}
{parent=Apple Inc. person}
{wiki}

Co-founder of &lt;Apple&gt;.

Is Jobs &lt;evil&gt;? Is he interesting? Undoubtedly.

https://www.folklore.org/ProjectView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;characters=Steve%20Jobs[] has some good anecdotes about him.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; is especially fond of: &lt;Jobs and Wozniak's blue box&gt;.

Good quotes:
* "Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money." quote at: &lt;don't be a pussy&gt;{full} and the related &lt;Jobs and Wozniak's blue box&gt; attitude
* "Steve Jobs Insult Response" on &lt;backward design&gt;
* Steve Jobs Pixar office design philosophy: great ideas happen from chance meetings on corridors, not in board rooms: https://officesnapshots.com/2012/07/16/pixar-headquarters-and-the-legacy-of-steve-jobs/
* &lt;Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address&gt;
* &lt;Here's to the crazy ones&gt;: Ciro would like to believe that this is mostly written by Jobs, but apparently it was just written by an advertisement agency. Good job though.

You must watch this: &lt;video Bill Gates vs Steve Jobs by Epic Rap Battles of History (2012)&gt;.

Evil deeds:
* not recognizing own daughter for many years??? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Brennan-Jobs
* lying to &lt;Steve Wozniak&gt; about the 5000 dollar Atari bonus: https://web.archive.org/web/20110612071502/http://www.woz.org/letters/general/91.html
* not giving stock to early garage employees: https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-wozniak-gave-early-apple-employees-10-million-in-stock-2014-9 OK, not a &lt;legal&gt; obligation. But... love?

= Steve Jobs quote on saving lives with a faster boot

This idea also comes up in other sources of course.

= Steve Jobs customers don't know what they want quote
{c}
{parent=Steve Jobs}

TODO clear attribution source:
&gt; Some people say, "Give the customers what they want." But that's not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they're going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, "If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, 'A faster horse!'" People don't know what they want until you show it to them. That's why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.

&lt;Bezos&gt; saying the same at &lt;video Jeff Bezos presentation at MIT (2002)&gt;: https://youtu.be/J2xGBlT0cqY?t=733[].
