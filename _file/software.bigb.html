We use the term "automatic programming" to mean "generating code from &lt;natural language&gt;".

The ultimate high level of which is of course to program with:
&gt; computer, make &lt;money&gt;
which is basically the goal of &lt;artificial general intelligence&gt;, especially according to &lt;The Employment Test&gt; definition of &lt;AGI&gt;.

The term has not always had that sense:
&gt; automatic programming has always been a euphemism for programming in a higher-level language than was then available to the programmer
sums it up.

But in the current &lt;AI boom&gt;, this is the sense that matters, so that's what we will go with.

Basically they require users to hand-code a metric and provide a program skeleton with some parts of the code marked to be replaced, and then the system focuses on modifying the code regions in question to optimize the metric.

All the novel results they announced were in &lt;constraint satisfaction problems&gt; or &lt;optimization problem&gt;. Their results are still awesome, but it's not very different from &lt;AlphaGo&gt; style things.

The tests are present in a gzip inside the Git repo: https://github.com/openai/human-eval/blob/master/data/HumanEval.jsonl.gz These researchers.

To get a quick overview of the problems with &lt;jq&gt;:
``
jq -r '"==== \(.task_id) \(.entry_point)\n\(.prompt)"' &lt;HumanEval.jsonl 
``

The first two problems are:
``
==== HumanEval/0 has_close_elements
from typing import List


def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -&gt; bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    &gt;&gt;&gt; has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """

==== HumanEval/1 separate_paren_groups
from typing import List


def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -&gt; List[str]:
    """ Input to this function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. Your goal is to
    separate those group into separate strings and return the list of those.
    Separate groups are balanced (each open brace is properly closed) and not nested within each other
    Ignore any spaces in the input string.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))')
    ['()', '(())', '(()())']
    """
``
so we understand that it takes as input an empty function with a docstring and you have to fill the function body.

The paper also shows that there can be other defined functions besides the one you have to implement.

= AlgoTune
{c}
{parent=AI code generation benchmark}

https://algotune.io/

This one focuses on improving speed of important numerical algorithms as compared to popular implementations.

The general pattern can be seen by observing the optimization of: https://algotune.io/aes_gcm_encryption_anthropic_claude-opus-4-1-20250805.html This shows the chat that the system had.

They define an OS interface to edit files and run right on the prompt, and tell at each stage how many credits are left for a given API and what the speedup was. Amazing. Each task has a \$1 budget per provider. Then their software parses commands out of the LLM output and sends formatted responses back. Quite amazing that it works at all.

All pieces of code seem to be in &lt;Python&gt;, and the speedups come mainly from using more advanced external computing libraries, like compiling with &lt;Cython&gt; or using faster external libraries that are pre-compiled, or more parallel. So it is not that impressive from a purely algorithmic point of view, but it is not bad either.

Correctness is checked automatically by comparing the optimized solution to the original non-optimized one likely for certain inputs.

{parent=LLVM Intermediate Representation}

Example: \a[llvm/hello.ll] adapted from: https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#module-structure but without double newline.

To execute it as mentioned at https://github.com/dfellis/llvm-hello-world[] we can either use their crazy assembly interpreter, tested on &lt;Ubuntu 22.10&gt;:
``
sudo apt install llvm-runtime
lli hello.ll
``
This seems to use `puts` from the &lt;C standard library&gt;.

Or we can &lt;Lower (compilation)&gt; it to &lt;assembly&gt; of the local machine:
``
sudo apt install llvm
llc hello.ll
``
which produces:
``
hello.s
``
and then we can assemble link and run with &lt;gcc&gt;:
``
gcc -o hello.out hello.s -no-pie
./hello.out
``
or with &lt;clang&gt;:
``
clang -o hello.out hello.s -no-pie
./hello.out
``
`hello.s` uses the &lt;GNU GAS&gt; format, which &lt;clang&gt; is highly compatible with, so both should work in general.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; found out that he likes computer security researchers and vice versa.

It's a bit the same reason why he likes &lt;physicists&gt;: you can't bullshit with security.

You can't just talk nice and hope for people to belive you.

You can't not try to break things and just &lt;security through obscurity&gt;[keep everyone happy in their false illusion of safety].

You can't do a half job.

If you do any of that, you \i[will] get your ass handed to you in a little gift bag.

All of this is closely linked to &lt;Ciro Santilli's self perceived creative personality&gt; and &lt;being naughty and creative are correlated&gt;.

The fatal flaw of OAuth is that websites have to enable specific providers, they can't just automatically select the correct OAuth for a given email domain. This means that the vast majority of websites will only provide the most widely popular providers such as &lt;Google&gt;, and the like, which means people won't have decent privacy.

So you are just better off with password logins and a decent &lt;password manager&gt;.

This is really good.

It allows the client to prepare a single request that gets all the data it wants to fill up a given webpage, rather than doing several separate requests.

So it only gets exactly what it needs, and in a single request.

= GNU parallel
{parent=List of command line utilities}
{tag=Good}
{tag=GNU package}
{wiki}

The author Ole Tange answers every question about it on &lt;Stack Exchange&gt;. What a legend!

This program makes you respect &lt;GNU make&gt; a bit more. Good old make with `-j` can not only parallelize, but also take in account a &lt;dependency graph&gt;.

Some examples under:
``
man parallel_exampes
``

To get the input argument explicitly job number use the magic string `{}`, e.g.:
``
printf 'a\nb\nc\n' | parallel echo '{}'
``
sample output:
``
a
b
c
``

To get the job number use `{#}` as in:
``
printf 'a\nb\nc\n' | parallel echo '{} {#}'
``
sample output:
``
a 1
b 2
c 3
c 3
``

`{%}` contains which thread the job running in, e.g. if we limit it to `2` threads with `-j2`:
``
printf 'a\nb\nc\nd\n' | parallel -j2 echo '{} {#} {%}'
``
sample output:
``
a 1 1
b 2 1
c 3 2
d 4 1
``
The percent must be a reference to "split the inputs module the number of workers", and modulo uses the `%` symbol in many programming languages such as &lt;C (language)&gt;.

To pass multiple CLI arguments per command you can use `-X` e.g.:
``
printf 'a\nb\nc\nd\n' | parallel -j2 -X echo '{} {#} {%}'
``
sample output:
``
a b 1 1
c d 2 2
``

{parent=Object-relational mapping}

How to decide if an ORM is decent? Just try to replicate every &lt;SQL&gt; query from \a[nodejs/sequelize/raw/many_to_many.js] on &lt;PostgreSQL&gt; and &lt;SQLite&gt;.

There is only a very finite number of possible reasonable queries on a two table many to many relationship with a join table. A decent ORM \i[has] to be able to do them all.

If it can do all those queries, then the ORM can actually do a good subset of SQL and is decent. If not, it can't, and this will make you suffer. E.g. &lt;Sequelize&gt; v5 is such an ORM that makes you suffer.

The next thing to check are transactions.

Basically, all of those come up if you try to implement a blog &lt;hello world&gt; world such as &lt;gothinkster realworld&gt; \i[correctly], i.e. without unnecessary inefficiencies due to your ORM on top of underlying SQL, and dealing with concurrency.

E.g., as of 2020, their help login https://help.openstreetmap.org/ shows MyOpenID as an option, which was discontinued in 2014, and not &lt;Google&gt; &lt;OAuth&gt;.

They do still seem to have a bit more activity than https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/openstreetmap on &lt;Stack Exchange&gt;.

Complaints:
* &lt;Transliteration&gt; is off by default!...... https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Translation You just have to learn all scripts ever. Good luck with the &lt;Chinese characters&gt;. Genius.
* In order to see information about places, you have to click "Query features" on the toolbar first. Who made such a terrible UI? Direct click is a much, and so easy to implement?
* It is impossible to discern different types of paths and other walking path symbols, the symbols are too small, and just scale down to a line no matter how much you zoom in.
* Power lines are way too visible. While that is kind of cool, it is useless and distracting to most people most of the time.
* No street-level imagery...: https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/1178/adding-photos
* No &lt;#aerial imagery&gt;: https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/6849/how-can-i-see-the-aerial-imagery-without-editing-the-map But that is kind of understandable, as that one might not be free.
* No restaurant ratings: https://help.openstreetmap.org/questions/64852/ratings-for-pois because it is "Subjective". OMG those people, such a huge value powerhouse wasted.

IDEs are absolutely essential for developing complex software.

The funny thing is that you don't notice this until someone shows it to you. But once you see it, there is not turning back, just like &lt;Steve Jobs customers don't know what they want quote&gt;.

Unfortunately, after the https://movingfulcrum.com/the-fall-of-eclipse/[Fall of Eclipse] (https://web.archive.org/web/20190824081229/https://movingfulcrum.com/the-fall-of-eclipse/[archive]), the IDE landscape in 2019 is horrible and split between:
* highly buggy but still feature rich Eclipse
* many may many other feature lacking options using possibly more trendy and forward lasting implementations like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)[Electron]
* awesome cross-platform proprietary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBrains[JetBrains] IDEs
* the God-like Windows-only proprietary language-lacking Visual Studio

Programmers of the world: unite! Focus on one IDE, and make it work for all languages and all build systems. Give it all the features that Eclipse has, but none of the bugginess. Work with top project to make sure the IDE works for all top projects.

Projects of the world: support one IDE, with in-tree configuration. Complex integration is often required between the IDE and the build system, and successful projects must to that once for all developers. Either do this, or watch you complex project wither away.

Build tool maintainers: make it possible for IDEs to support your tool! E.g., implement https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html[JSON Compilation Database] output so that IDEs can read the exact compiler commands from that, in order to automatically determine how files should be parsed! Or better, just use libllvm in your IDE itself as the main parser.

= Eclipse
{disambiguate=IDE}
{c}
{parent=Integrated development environment}
{wiki=Eclipse_(software)}

Once upon a time (early 2010's), Eclipse dominated the IDE landscape and all was good. NetBeans was around too. And &lt;Java&gt; was still unmarred by &lt;Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.&gt;.

But then something happened.

For some reason, Eclipse started to decay.

And the project that had once been a vibrant community of awesomeness, started to become... a zombie of its former self.

Buggyness started increasing. And not even hard to fix bugs. One liners that affect every user immediately after startup.

Sometimes, to Eclipse's defense they weren't "bugs". Just features that it became evident with time every programmer expected from a modern IDE.

But somehow the Eclipse community had a deep problem. A cancer. It had completely lost touch with user experience.

Perhaps is was due to the increasing interest of the several corporations that had adopted Eclipse as the base IDE for the proprietary solutions?

Perhaps.

Many users stuck to the IDE.

Some heroic efforts were made as plugins that drastically improved certain defects. The Darkest Dark plugin comes to mind.

But all those efforts required configuration. A setup time that most users simply don't have. The core devteam had become dumb and dead, unable to incorporate such changes.

This greatly opened up the space for other competing IDEs to come along. The "semi feature complete but at least easy to use and not so buggy" &lt;Visual Studio Code&gt; and the proprietary &lt;JetBrains&gt; IDEs being some of the most notable ones.

Using Eclipse as of the early 2020's is such a mixed experience. If you spend enough time to configure out the key buggyness, there are moments where you can feel "OMG, this feature is amazing".

But the effort is just too great, and soon another bug or obvious missing feature hits you and brings you back to reality.

Every young person uses &lt;VS Code&gt; now. Eclipse is dead, and there is no way back, usage will just continue dropping.

RIP, Eclipse. It wasn't meant to be.

= FFmpeg
{c}
{parent=Multimedia software}
{wiki}

FFmpeg is the &lt;assembler (computing)&gt; of audio and video.

As a result, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; who likes "lower level stuff", has had many many hours if image manipulation fun with this software, see e.g.:
* the "Media" section of &lt;articles&gt;.
* &lt;image Ciro knows how to convert videos to GIFs&gt;

As older Ciro grows, the more he notices that FFmpeg can do basically any lower level audio video task. It is just an amazing piece of software, the immediate go-to for any low level operation.

FFmpeg was created by &lt;Fabrice Bellard&gt;, which Ciro deeply respects.

Resize a video: https://superuser.com/questions/624563/how-to-resize-a-video-to-make-it-smaller-with-ffmpeg[]:
``
ffmpeg -i input.avi -filter:v scale=720:-1 -c:a copy output.mkv
``
Unlike every other convention under the sun, the height in `scale` is the first number.

= FFmpeg filter graph
{c}
{parent=FFmpeg}

Filter graphs are a thing of great beauty. What an amazingly obscure &lt;domain-specific language&gt;, but which can produce striking results with very little!!!

A quick example from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59551013/how-to-generate-stereo-sine-wave-using-ffmpeg-with-different-frequencies-for-eac/77730492#77730492 illustrates some of the fundamentals:

``
ffplay -autoexit -nodisp -f lavfi -i '
sine=frequency=500[a];
sine=frequency=1000[b];
[a][b]amerge, atrim=end=2
'
``
which creates a graph:
``
                              +--------+
[sine=frequency=500]---&gt;[a]--&gt;|        |
                              | amerge |--&gt;[atrim]--&gt;[output]
[sine=frequency=1000]--&gt;[b]--&gt;|        |
                              +--------+
``
and plays 500 Hz on the left channel and 1000 Hz on the right channel for 2 seconds.

So we see the following syntax patterns:
* `sine`, `amerge` and `atrim` are filters
* `sine=frequency=500`: the first `=` says "araguments follow"
  * `frequency=500` sets the `frequency` argument of the `sine` filter
  * for multiple arguments the syntax is to separate arguments with colons e.g. `sine=frequency=500:duration=2`
* `;`: separates statements
* `[a]`, `[b]`: sets the name of an edge
* `,`: creates unnamed edge between filters that have one input and one output

A list of all filters can be obtained ith:
``
ffmpeg -filters
``
and parameters for a single filter can be obtained with:
``
ffmpeg --help filter=sine
``

TODO possible? https://superuser.com/questions/559768/ffplay-how-to-play-together-separate-video-and-audio-files

For synthesized streams like `sine` we can do it e.g.

sine=frequency=1000[b];
[a][b]amerge, atrim=end=2
'
``
but it does not seem to accept multiple `-i` for some reason. So is there a way to open a file from some filter? E.g.:
``
ffplay -i tmp.wav -i tmp.mkv -filter_complex "[0:a]atrim=end=2[a];[1:v]trim=end=2[v]" -map '[a]' -map '[v]'
``
fails with:
``
Argument 'tmp.mkv' provided as input filename, but 'tmp.wav' was already specified.

What happens when https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL[the underdogs] get https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1780599/what-is-the-meaning-of-posix/31865755#31865755[together] and try to factor out their efforts to beat some https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA[evil] dominant &lt;Microsoft Windows&gt;[power], sometimes &lt;Linux&gt;[victoriously].

Or when https://github.com/facebook[startups] use the cheapest stuff available and randomly become the https://github.com/google[next big thing], and decide to keep maintaining the open stuff to get features for free from other companies, or because they are &lt;Linux&gt;[forced by the Holy GPL].

Open source frees employees. When you change jobs, a large part of the specific knowledge you acquired about closed source a project with your blood and tears goes to the trash. When companies get bought, projects get shut down, and closed source code goes to the trash. What sane non desperate person would sell their life energy into such closed source projects that could die at any moment? Working on open source is the single most important non money perk a company can have to attract the best employees.

Open source is worth more than the mere pragmatic financial value of not having to pay for software or the ability to freely add new features.

Its greatest value is perhaps the fact that it allows people study it, to appreciate the beauty of the code, and feel empowered by being able to add the features that they want.

That is why &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; thought:
&gt; Life is too short for closed source.

But quoting Ciro's colleague S.:
&gt; Every software is open source when you read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language[assembly code].

And https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/7809/what-does-gpu-assembly-look-like["can reverse engineer the undocumented GPU hardware APIs"], &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;[Ciro] would add.

While software is the most developed open source technology available in the 2010's, due to the https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/24/18715421/internet-free-data-ads-cost["zero cost"] of copying it over the Internet, Ciro also believes that &lt;open knowledge&gt;[the world would benefit enormously from open source knowledge in all areas on science and engineering], for the same reasons as open source.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; defines liberal as: "can be commercialized without paying anything back" (but possibly subject to other restrictions).

He therefore does not consider &lt;Creative Commons licenses&gt; with NC to be FOSS.

For the newbs, the term &lt;open source software&gt; is good enough, since most open source software is also FOSS.

But when it's not, it's crucial to know.

This model can work well when there is a set of commonly used libraries that some developers often use together, but such that there isn't enough maintenance work for each one individually.

= Horrors of open source
{parent=Open source software}

Not everything is perfect.

One big problem of many big open source projects is that they are contributed to by separate selfish organizations, that have private information. Then what happens is that:
* people implement the same thing twice, or one change makes the other completely unmergeable
* you get bugs but can't share your closed source test cases, and then you can't automate tests for them, or clearly demonstrate the problem
* other contributors don't see your full semi secret important motivation, and may either nitpick too much or take too long to review your stuff

Another common difficulty is that open source maintainers may simply not care enough about their own project (maybe they did in the past but lost interest) to review external patches by people they don't know.

This is understandable: a new patch, is a new risk of things breaking.

Therefore, if you ever submit patches and they get ignore, don't be too sad. It just comes down to a question of maintenance cost, and means that you will waste some extra time on the next rebase. You just have to decide your goals and be cold about it:
* are you doing the right thing and going for a specific goal &lt;backward design&gt;? Then just fork, run as fast as possible towards a minimum viable product, and if you start to feel that rebase is costing you a lot, or feel you could get some open source fame for cheap, open reviews and see what upstream says. If they ignore you, politely tell yourself in your mind silently "&lt;fuck&gt; them", and carry on with the MVP
* otherwise, e.g. you just want to randomly help out, you have to ask them before doing anything big "how can I be of help". If I propose a patch for this issue, do you promise to review it?

Writing documentation in an open source project in which you don't have immediate push rights is another major pain due to code reviews. Code code reviews tend to be much less subjective, because if you do something wrong, stuff crashes, runs slower, or you need more lines of code to reach the same goal. There are tradeoffs, but in a limited number. Documentation code reviews on the other hand, are an open invitation to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality[infinite bike-shedding], since you can't "run" documentation through a standardized &lt;brain&gt;[brain model]. Much better is for one good documenter person to just make one cohesive &lt;Stack Overflow&gt; post, and ping others with more knowledge to review details or add any missing pieces :-)

Amazing project, that basically makes a more searchable &lt;Wayback Machine&gt;.

A bit hard to use their data though, partly due to size, but also lack of free to use querrying mechanisms, and how obtuse &lt;Amazon S3&gt; is to use.

Notably, &lt;aws-cli&gt; with an account is the only reliable way, everything else is way too broken, e.g. trying the to check the an index https://index.commoncrawl.org/CC-MAIN-2023-06/ very often 500s.

But still, their projct is amazing.

The only out-of-the-box search they seem to have is: http://urlsearch.commoncrawl.org/[] for domains/URLs. It is good, but there could be so much more... notably &lt;IPs&gt;.

Also could should document the data shape a bit better.

Sample sizes can be found at: https://commoncrawl.org/2023/04/mar-apr-2023-crawl-archive-now-available/

To explore the data, after login:
``
aws s3 ls s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/

Copy the toplevel directory only:
``

In 2017 apparently they've started making their own Web Graphs, i.e. they parse the HTML and extract the graph of what links to what.

This is exactly what we need for an open implementation of &lt;PageRank&gt;.

Edit: actually, they already calculate &lt;PageRank&gt; for us!!! Fantastic!!! Main section: &lt;Common Crawl web graph official PageRank&gt;{full}.

The graphs are dumped in &lt;BVGraph&gt; format.

A quick exploration of the graph can be seen at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/issues/198

This is the dream &lt;exam&gt;[cheating] software every student should know about.

It also has serious applications obviously. https://www.sympy.org/scipy-2017-codegen-tutorial/ mentions &lt;code generation&gt; capabilities, which sounds super cool!

The code in this section was tested on `sympy==1.8` and &lt;Python&gt; 3.9.5.

Let's start with some basics. &lt;fractions&gt;:
``
from sympy import *
sympify(2)/3 + sympify(1)/2
``
outputs:
``
7/6
``
Note that this is an exact value, it does not get converted to &lt;floating-point numbers&gt; where precision could be lost!

We can also do everything with symbols:
``
from sympy import *
x, y = symbols('x y')
expr = x/3 + y/2
print(expr)
``
outputs:
``
x/3 + y/2
``
We can now evaluate that expression object at any time:
``
expr.subs({x: 1, y: 2})
``
outputs:
``
4/3
``

How about a square root?
``
x = sqrt(2)
print(x)
``
outputs:
``
sqrt(2)
``
so we understand that the value was kept without simplification. And of course:
``
sqrt(2)**2
``
outputs `2`. Also:
``
sqrt(-1)
``
outputs:
``
I
``
`I` is the &lt;imaginary unit&gt;. We can use that symbol directly as well, e.g.:
``
I*I
``
gives:
``
-1
``

Let's do some trigonometry:
``
cos(pi)
``
gives:
``
-1
``
and:
``
cos(pi/4)
``
gives:
``
sqrt(2)/2
``
The exponential also works:
``
exp(I*pi)
``
gives;
``
-1
``

Now for some &lt;calculus&gt;. To find the &lt;derivative&gt; of the &lt;natural logarithm&gt;:
``
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
print(diff(ln(x), x))
``
outputs:
``
1/x
``
Just read that. One over x. Beauty. And now for some integration:
``
print(integrate(1/x, x))
``
outputs:
``
log(x)
``
OK.

Let's do some more. Let's solve a simple &lt;differential equation&gt;:
``
y''(t) - 2y'(t) + y(t) = sin(t)
``
Doing:
``
from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
f, g = symbols('f g', cls=Function)
diffeq = Eq(f(x).diff(x, x) - 2*f(x).diff(x) + f(x), sin(x)**4)
print(dsolve(diffeq, f(x)))
``
outputs:
``
Eq(f(x), (C1 + C2*x)*exp(x) + cos(x)/2)
``
which means:
$$
f(x) = C_1 + C_2x e^x + cos(x)/2
$$
To be fair though, it can't do anything crazy, it likely just goes over known patterns that it has solvers for, e.g. if we change it to:
``
diffeq = Eq(f(x).diff(x, x)**2 + f(x), 0)
``
it just blows up:
``
NotImplementedError: solve: Cannot solve f(x) + Derivative(f(x), (x, 2))**2
``
Sad.

Let's try some &lt;polynomial equations&gt;:
``
from sympy import *
x, a, b, c = symbols('x a b c d e f')
eq = Eq(a*x**2 + b*x + c, 0)
sol = solveset(eq, x)
print(sol)
``
which outputs:
``
FiniteSet(-b/(2*a) - sqrt(-4*a*c + b**2)/(2*a), -b/(2*a) + sqrt(-4*a*c + b**2)/(2*a))
``
which is a not amazingly nice version of the &lt;quadratic formula&gt;. Let's evaluate with some specific constants after the fact:
``
sol.subs({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3})
``
which outputs
``
FiniteSet(-1 + sqrt(2)*I, -1 - sqrt(2)*I)
``
Let's see if it handles the &lt;quartic equation&gt;:
``
x, a, b, c, d, e, f = symbols('x a b c d e f')
eq = Eq(e*x**4 + d*x**3 + c*x**2 + b*x + a, 0)
solveset(eq, x)
``
Something comes out. It takes up the entire terminal. Naughty. And now let's try to &lt;Abel-Ruffini theorem&gt;[mess with it]:
``
x, a, b, c, d, e, f = symbols('x a b c d e f')
eq = Eq(f*x**5 + e*x**4 + d*x**3 + c*x**2 + b*x + a, 0)
solveset(eq, x)
``
and this time it spits out something more magic:
``
ConditionSet(x, Eq(a + b*x + c*x**2 + d*x**3 + e*x**4 + f*x**5, 0), Complexes)
``
Oh well.

Let's try some &lt;linear algebra&gt;.
``
m = Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
``
Let's invert it:
``
m**-1
``
outputs:
``
Matrix([
[ -2,    1],
[3/2, -1/2]])
``

= Debugging
{parent=Software bug}
{wiki}

Debugging sucks. But there's also nothing quite that "oh fuck, that's why it doesn't work" moment, which happens after you have examined and placed everything that is relevant to the problem into your brain. You just can't see it coming. It just happens. You just learn what you generally have to look at so it happens faster.

= Ciro's call hierarchy notation
{c}
{parent=Debugging}

This is a simple hierarchical plaintext notation &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; created to explain programs to himself.

It is usuall created by doing searches in an &lt;IDE&gt;, and then manually selecting the information of interest.

It attempts to capture intuitive information not only of the call graph itself, including callbacks, but of when things get called or not, by the addition of some context code.

For example, consider the following &lt;pseudocode&gt;:
``
f1() {
}

f2(i) {
  if (i &gt; 5) {
    f1()
  }
}

f3() {
  f1()
  f2_2()
}

f2_2() {
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {

    f2(i)
  }
}

main() {
  f2_2()
  f3()
}
``
Supose that we are interested in determining what calls `f1`.

Then a reasonable call hierarchy for `f1` would be:
``
f2(i)
  if (i &gt; 5) {
    f1()

  f2_2()
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
      f2(i)

    main
    f3
f3()
  main()
``

Some general principles:
* start with a regular call tree
* to include context:
  * remove any blank lines from the snippet of interest
  * add it indented below the function
  * and then follow it up with a blank line
  * and then finally add any callers at the same indentation level

&lt;Git&gt; has some helpers to help you achieve bisection Nirvana: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4713088/how-to-use-git-bisect/22592593#22592593

Obviously not restricted to software engineering alone, and used in all areas of engineering, e.g. &lt;video Air-tight vs. Vacuum-tight by AlphaPhoenix (2020)&gt; uses it in &lt;vacuum engineering&gt;.

The cool thing about bisection is that it is a brainless process: unlike when using a &lt;debugger&gt;, you don't have to understand anything about the system, and it incredibly narrows down the problem cause for you. Not having to think is great!

= Excessive encapsulation is the root of much evil
{parent=Ciro Santilli's software engineering wisdom}
{tag=You aren't gonna need it}

Some anecdotes.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; never splits up functions unless there is more than one calling point. If you split early, the chances that the interface will be wrong are huge, and a much larger refactoring follows.

If you just want to separate variables, just use a scope e.g.:

``
int cross_block_var;

// First step.
{
    int myvar;
}

// Second step.
{
    int myvar;
}
``

Ciro has seen and had to deal with in his lifetime with two projects that had like 3 to 10 git separate Git repositories, all created and maintained by the same small group of developers of the same organization, even though one could not build without the other. Keeping everything in sync was Hell! Why not just have three directories inside a single repository with a single source of truth?

Another important case: &lt;Linux&gt; should have at least a C standard library, init system, and shell in-tree, like &lt;BSD Operating Systems&gt;, as mentioned at: &lt;Linux&gt;{full}.

= The development cycle time is your God
{parent=Ciro Santilli's software engineering wisdom}

A slow development test cycle will kill your software.

New developers won't want to learn your project, because they would rather shoot themselves.

This means that build time, and the time to run tests, must be short.

5 seconds to rebuild is the maximum upper limit.

Of course, at some point software gets large enough that things won't fit anymore in 5 seconds. But then you \i[must] have either some kind of build caching, or options to do partial builds/tests that will bring things down to that 5 second mark.

You also have to spend some time profiling execution and build from scratch times.

A slow build from scratch will mean that your &lt;continuous integration&gt; costs a lot, money that could be invested in a new developer!

It also means that people won't bother to reproduce bugs on given commits, or &lt;bisection (software engineering)&gt;[bisect stuff].

One anecdote comes to mind. &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; was trying to debug something, and more experience colleague came over.

To reproduce a problem, ciro was running one command, wait 5 seconds, run a second command, wait 5 seconds, run a third command:
``
cmd1
# wait 5 seconds
cmd2
# wait 5 seconds
cmd3
``

The first thing the colleague said: join those three commands into one:
``
cmd1;cmd2;cmd3
``
And so, &lt;the correlation between software engineers and Buddhism&gt;[Ciro was enlightened].

Sometimes you are really certain that something is a required substep for another thing that is coming right afterwards.

When things are this concrete, fine, just do the substep.

But you have to always beware of cases where "I'm sure this will be needed at some unspecified point in the future", because such points tends to never happen.

YAGNI is so fundamental, there are several closely related concepts to it:
* &lt;backward design&gt;
* &lt;assign the hard task to the lazy person&gt;

= It is impossible to predict how long it will take to do something
{synonym}

The trivial takes a few hours.

The easy takes a week.

And what seemed hard takes a few hours.

As "deadlines" approach, feature sets get cut down, then there are delays, and finally a feasible feature set is delivered some time after the deadline.

The only deadlines that can be met are those of tasks which have already been done but not announced.

This is of course &lt;Hofstadter's law&gt;.

On the other hand, as a colleague of Ciro once mentioned, it is also known that the time it takes for a task to be done expands without limits to match the deadline. And therefore, without deadlines, tasks will take forever and never get done.

And so, in a moment, perceiving &lt;Koan&gt;[this paradox], &lt;the correlation between software engineers and Buddhism&gt;[Ciro was enlightened].

= Sometimes you can debug software by staring at the code for long enough
{parent=Ciro Santilli's software engineering wisdom}
{wiki}

Once upon a time, when &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; had a job, he had a programming problem.

A senior developer came over, and rather than trying to run and modify the code like an idiot, which is what &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; usually does (see also experimentalism remarks at &lt;Ciro Santilli's bad old event memory&gt;{full}), he just stared at the code for about 10 minutes.

We knew that the problem was likely in a particular function, but it was really hard to see why things were going wrong.

After the 10 minutes of examining every line in minute detail, he said:
&gt; I think this function call has such or such weird edge case
and truly, that was the cause.

And so, &lt;the correlation between software engineers and Buddhism&gt;[Ciro was enlightened].

Working remotely is hard if you don't already highly master the software and enterprise systems used.

Also you don't feel people's love as strongly, and usefulness is built on love, see also &lt;Steve Jobs&gt;'s Pixar office space design philosophy.

But please, give workers a small silent office so that we can concentrate instead of a silly open space, and create an internal social network so people can see what others are doing.

Remote working is much better if the majority of the team also does it, otherwise you will get excluded. Maybe after VR...

{synonym}

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; believes that there is a positive correlation between being a &lt;software engineer&gt;[software engineer] and liking &lt;Buddhist&gt;-like things.

Maybe it is linked to minimalism and &lt;DRY&gt;, which software engineers value so greatly.

Even Ciro had to try an unoriginal Buddhist joke intro in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572897/how-does-javascript-prototype-work/23877420#23877420[one of this Stack Overflow answers].

Ciro also feels that his https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/tree/e1d0a2fafbb35c9e65c1a8a0b6d46df3e9161461/userland["minimal reproducible example" scientific language/concept learning method obsession] of breaking things into tiny sub-problems has a strong link with &lt;Koans&gt;.

Some notable Buddhism/programmer examples:
* http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/ "The Unix Koans of Master Foo - Rootless Root (无根的根)" by the legendary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond[Eric Steven Raymond] is notable
* http://thecodelesscode.com/ "The Codeless Code" by anonymous Qi.
* http://canonical.org/~kragen/tao-of-programming.html
* https://wiki.c2.com/?MysticalProgrammingKoans
* http://rubykoans.com/[] even &lt;evil&gt; programming languages adopt them!
* &lt;The Zen of Python&gt;

Another thing that points the correlation out is the existence of https://wattsalan.github.io/ on a `github.io` about &lt;Alan Watts&gt;.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s joke version of the Chinese &lt;Four Treasures of the Study&gt;!
* &lt;web browser&gt;
* &lt;Text editor&gt;
* &lt;terminal&gt;. Though to be honest, circa 2022, Ciro learned of the ctrl + click to open file (including with file.c:123 line syntax) ability of &lt;Visual Studio Code&gt; (likely present in other &lt;IDEs&gt;), and he was starting considering dumping the terminal altogether if some implementation gets it really really right. The main thing is that it can't be a tinny little bar at the bottom, it has to be full window and super easily toggleable!
In the past, Ciro used to use &lt;file managers&gt;, which would be the fourth tresure. But he stopped doing so for years due to his cd alias... so it became three. He actually had exactly three windows open when he was checking if there was anything else he could not open hand of.

Aaron, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; will complete &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt;[your quest to make eduction free]. Just &lt;legally&gt; this time, with the and with the &lt;Creative Commons license&gt; you helped to create.

Ciro likes how &lt;The Internet's Own Boy (2014)&gt; explains how Aaron felt like high school was &lt;bullshit&gt;, and that he could &lt;autodidacticism&gt;[learn whatever he wanted from books], &lt;ourbigbook.com/motivation&gt;[which is one of Ciro's key feelings].

It also mentions how he was a natural teacher from a very early age.

Note to self: if you are going to commit a &lt;crime&gt;, don't publish your plans online.

&lt;Ross Ulbricht&gt;'s diaries come to mind.

That's how &lt;Russian&gt; &lt;shadow library&gt; maintainers do it, they know how to crime good old Russians. Maybe there is a good thing about having &lt;dictatorships&gt; in the world that give zero fucks about &lt;American&gt; copyright laws. There will always be some random &lt;Russian&gt; academic who will implement this and not go to jail. Maybe it's even &lt;government&gt;[state] sponsored.

This resonates a lot with &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s ideas!
* &lt;physics and the illusion of life&gt;
* &lt;physics education needs more focus on understanding experiments and their history&gt;:
  * &lt;there is value in tutorials written by early pioneers of the field&gt;{full}
  * &lt;doing physics means calculating a number&gt;{full}
* &lt;education is broken&gt;
* &lt;molecular biology feels like systems programming&gt;

Lots of similar ideologies to &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;, love it:
* https://sandymaguire.me/about/[]:
  * he's an &lt;idealist&gt;

  &gt; I might best be described somewhere between independent researcher and voluntarily-unemployed bum. At the ripe old age of 27 I decided to quit my highly-lucrative engineering job and decide to focus more on living than on grinding for the man. It's what you might call a work in progress.
* https://sandymaguire.me/blog/reaching-climbing/[]: &lt;don't be a pussy&gt;
  &gt; Last Friday was my final day at work. According to my facebook profile, I am now "happily retired." As of today, I don't plan to do another day of "traditional work" in my life. That's not to say that I'll be sitting idle playing tiddly winks. I want to build things, to dedicate my life to independent study, and to get really, really good with building communities. I don't have time for any of this "work" stuff that somehow pervades our entire culture, choking our inspiration and sapping our energy away from the things we'd rather be doing.
  One is also reminded of &lt;Gwern Branwen&gt;. Sandy is also into self-improvement stuff, so even more like Gwern. This is a point Ciro diverges on. Ciro works actively on self-worsening.
* he thinks &lt;university&gt; is useless:
  * https://sandymaguire.me/blog/where-uni-fails/ Where University Fails (2018), mostly talking about &lt;backward design&gt;
  * https://sandymaguire.me/blog/gatekept/ rejected from &lt;Imperial College&gt; &lt;PhD&gt; program due to &lt;grade (exam)&gt; being slightly too low for their stupid requirements, even though he had a referral already, and an amazing CV
* he likes &lt;jazz&gt;: https://sandymaguire.me/blog/too-smart/

Other interesting points:
* https://sandymaguire.me/blog/sandy-runback/ he changed his own name to Sandy because he didn't like it, he was born Alexander
* https://algebradriven.design/ &lt;closed source&gt; books though, ouch. At least they seem to have been made with &lt;leanpub&gt; though, could be worse.

He's a &lt;Haskell&gt; person.

He posts insanely much on these websites. It's a bit like &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; on &lt;Stack Overflow&gt;.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; envies this guy a bit. He &lt;Braindumping&gt;[dumps his brain more or less full time on his highly customized static website] partly due to early &lt;Bitcoin&gt; investments https://gwern.net/me[] says:
&gt; I am a freelance &lt;American&gt; writer &amp; researcher. (To make ends meet, I have a &lt;Patreon&gt;, benefit from &lt;Bitcoin&gt; appreciation thanks to some old coins, and live frugally.)

Also unsurprisingly he likes &lt;Haskell&gt;:
&gt; I mostly contribute to projects in Haskell, my favorite language

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; considers Gwern &lt;Ciro Santilli's e-soulmates&gt; due to his interest in "dark web things" like &lt;Bitcoin&gt; and &lt;Silk Road&gt;, his immense writing output in encyclopedic book-sized articles on a &lt;static website&gt;, and his desire to live frugally and just research and write all day. Ah, if only Ciro had some old coins!!!

This is likely a pseudonym, his real name not being publicly unknown, e.g. at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5659278[]:
&gt; &gt; Why do you choose relative anonymity?

  For the reasons I've said in the past. To which I can add personal safety: my &lt;Silk Road&gt; page is a bit questionable legally, and we all know that there are ways to exploit knowledge of one's True Name and address (even if, as far as I know, I have no enemies willing to resort to, say, 'swatting' me) - one group of stalkers called up a college they thought I worked at to see if they could get me fired or otherwise ruin my day.

= Programming
{synonym}

Programming is hard. To &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;, it's almost masochistic.

What makes Ciro especially mad when programming is not the hard things.

It is the things that should be easy, but aren't, and which take up a lot of your programming time.

Especially when you are already a few levels of "simple problems" down from your original goal, and another one of them shows up.

This is basically the cause of &lt;Hofstadter's law&gt;.

But of course, it is because it is hard that it feels amazing when you achieve your goal.

Putting a complex and useful program together is like composing a symphony, or reaching the summit of a hard &lt;rock climbing&gt; proble.

Programming can be an &lt;art&gt; form. There can be great beauty in code and what it does. It is a shame that this is hard to see from within the walls of most &lt;companies&gt;, where you are stuck doing a small specific task as fast as possible.

This script tests all executables under a selected directory.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; has been writing scripts of that type for a long time in order to test his &lt;Ciro Santilli's documentation superpowers&gt;[programming self-learning setups with asserts].

The most advanced of those being the https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/blob/9b6552ab6c66cb14d531eff903c4e78f3561e9ca/test[test system] of &lt;Linux Kernel Module Cheat&gt;.

But had too much stuff that would be specific to that project, so Ciro decided to start this new one in &lt;Node.js&gt;, hopefully it will also be the last he ever writes.

{parent=Software testing}
{wiki}

This is a good approach. The downside is that while you are developing the implementation and testing interactively you might notice that the requirements are wrong, and then the tests have to change.

One intermediate approach &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; likes is to do the implementation and be happy with interactive usage, then create the test, make it pass, then remove the code that would make it pass, and see it fail. This does have a risk that you will forget to test something, but Ciro finds it is a worth it generally. Unless it really is one of those features that you are unable to develop without an automated test, generally more "logical/mathematical" stuff. This is a sort of &lt;laziness Driven Development&gt;.

= Git design rationale
{c}
{parent=Git}

The fundamental insight of Git design is: a &lt;SHA&gt; represents not only current state, but also the full history due to the &lt;Merkle tree&gt; implementation, see notably:

This makes it so that you will always notice if you are overwriting history on the remote, even if you are developing from two separate local computers (or more commonly, two people in two different local computers) and therefore will never lose any work accidentally.

It is very hard to achieve that without the &lt;Merkle tree&gt;.

Consider for example the most naive approach possible of marking versions with consecutive numbers:
* Local 1:
  * 0: root commit
  * 1: commit 1
  * 2: commit 2 by local 1
* Local 2:
  * 0: root commit
  * 1: commit 1
  * 2: commit 2 by local 2
  * 3: commit 3 by local 2
* Remote
  * 0: root commit
  * 1: commit 1

If Local 1 were to push to Remote first, how could Local 2 notice that when it tries to push itself? The navie method of just checking: "does Remote have commit "2"" does not work, because Local 2 has a different version of commit 2 than local 1.
