Ciro's tutorial: &lt;Linux Kernel Module Cheat&gt;.

= Being proud of low level programming is stupid
{parent=Systems programming}
{tag=Essays by Ciro Santilli}

Ciro's word of caution for 2019 aspiring system programmers: https://cirosantilli.com/linux-kernel-module-cheat/#should-you-waste-your-life-with-systems-programming[Should you waste your life with systems programming?]

This is basically a direct consequence of &lt;backward design&gt;.

The higher the level you can operate at, the better.

&lt;C (language)&gt; is better than &lt;assembly&gt;, &lt;userland&gt; better than &lt;kernelland&gt;.

The ideal level to operate at, and one of humankind's greatest ambitions is "&lt;AGI&gt;, make me money", the highest possible level.

Only go down a level when it seems necessary.

Bare metal programming is to run a program without an &lt;operating system&gt; below it.

Or in other words, it is basically implementing an &lt;operating system&gt;/&lt;firmware&gt; yourself ad hoc, together with your actual program.

It is interpreted. It actually implements a Python (-like ?) interpreter that can run on a microcontroller. See e.g.: &lt;Compile MicroPython code for Micro Bit locally&gt;.

As a result, it is both very convenient, as it does not require a C toolchain to build for, but also very slow and produces larger images.

Under: \a[micropython]

Toggle pin 0 twice per second. This could be used for example to blink LED on pin 0 once per second with this test circuit:

``

       R_2k    |

Real hardware is for newbs. Real hardware is for newbs.

Tested on &lt;Ubuntu 23.10&gt; we approximately follow instructions from: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.4.0/develop/getting_started/index.html stopping before the "Flash the sample" section, as we don't flash &lt;QEMU&gt;. We just run it.

``
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends git cmake ninja-build gperf \
  ccache dfu-util device-tree-compiler wget \
  python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-tk python3-wheel xz-utils file \
  make gcc gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl2-dev libmagic1 python3-pyelftools
python3 -m venv ~/zephyrproject/.venv
source ~/zephyrproject/.venv/bin/activate
pip install west
west init ~/zephyrproject
cd ~/zephyrproject
west update
west zephyr-export
cd ~
wget https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/download/v0.16.1/zephyr-sdk-0.16.1_linux-x86_64.tar.xz
tar xvf zephyr-sdk-0.16.1_linux-x86_64.tar.xz
cd zephyr-sdk-0.16.1
./setup.sh
``

The installation procedure install all &lt;compiler toolchains&gt; for us, so we can then basically compile for any target. It also fetches the latest Git source code of Zephyr under:
``
~/zephyrproject/zephyr
``

The "most default" blinky hello world example which blinks an LED is a bit useless for us because QEMU doesn't have LEDs, so instead we are going to use one of the &lt;UART&gt; examples which will print characters we can see on QEMU stdout.

Let's start with the &lt;hello world&gt; example on an x86 target:
``
cd ~/zephyrproject/zephyr
west build -b qemu_x86 samples/hello_world -t run
``
and it outputs:
``
Hello World! qemu_x86
``
The `qemu_x64` on the output comes from the `CONFIG_BOARD` macro https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/c15ff103001899ba0321b2c38013d1008584edc0/samples/hello_world/src/main.c#L11
``
#include &lt;zephyr/kernel.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
	printk("Hello World! %s\n", CONFIG_BOARD);
	return 0;
}
``

The `qemu_x86` board is documented at: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.4.0/boards/x86/qemu_x86/doc/index.html

You can also first `cd` into the directory that you want to build in to avoid typing `samples/hello_world` all the time:
``
cd ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/hello_world
zephyr west build -b qemu_x86 -t run
``

You can also build and run separately with:
``
west build -b qemu_x86
west build -t run
``

Another important option is:
``
west build -t menuconfig
``
But note that it does not modify your `prj.conf` automatically for you.

Let's try on another target:
``
rm -rf build
zephyr west build -b qemu_cortex_a53 -t run
``
and same output, but on a completely different board! The `qemu_cortex_a53` board is documented at: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.4.0/boards/arm64/qemu_cortex_a53/doc/index.html

The list of all examples can be seen under:
``
ls ~/zephyrproject/zephyr/samples
``
which for example contains:
``
zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/hello_world
``

So run another sample simply select it, e.g. to run `zephyrproject/zephyr/samples/synchronization`:
``
west build -b qemu_cortex_a53 samples/synchronization -t run
``

It ain't perfect, but it's decent enough.

From a technical point of view, it can do anything that &lt;Microsoft Windows&gt; can. Except being forcefully installed on every non-&lt;MacOS&gt; 2019 computer you can buy.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s conversion to Linux happened around 2012, and was a central part of &lt;Ciro Santilli's Open Source Enlightenment&gt;, since it fundamentally enables the discovery and contribution to &lt;open source software&gt;. Because what awesome open source person would waste time porting their amazing projects to closed source OSes?

Ciro's modest nature can be seen as he likes to compare this event https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Renunciation[Buddha's Great Renunciation].

Linux should track glibc and &lt;POSIX command line utilities&gt; in-tree like &lt;BSD Operating System&gt;, otherwise people have &lt;Linux Kernel Module Cheat&gt;[no way to get the thing running in the first place without blobs or large out-of-tree scripts]! https://blog.farhan.codes/2018/06/25/linux-maintains-bugs-the-real-reason-ifconfig-on-linux-is-deprecated/[Another enlightened soul] who agrees.

Particularly interesting in the history of Linux is how it won out over the open competitors that were coming up in the time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX[MINIX] (see https://ponderwall.com/index.php/2019/04/02/linux-tanenbaum-newsgroup-linus-torvalds/[the chat]) and &lt;BSD Operating System&gt; that got https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_Laboratories,_Inc._v._Berkeley_Software_Design,_Inc.[legally bogged down] at the critical growth moment.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s Linux distro of choice as of 2019.

It ain't perfect, but it's decent enough.

The greatest advantage of it being that it has the likely largest desktop user base, and therefore the highest likelihood that your problems are solved on https://askubuntu.com/users/52975[Ask Ubuntu], and goes together with Ciro's philosophy that &lt;having more than one natural language is bad for the world&gt;["people should do everything in the same way to factor stuff out"], especially the &lt;open source software&gt;[open source losers].

Ciro considers that the killer flaw of Ubuntu, and most desktop distros of 2020, is that no one under the Sun knows how to build them fully from source: &lt;Linux distribution buildable from source&gt;. This is why Ciro based the &lt;Linux Kernel Module Cheat&gt; on &lt;Buildroot&gt;, see also: &lt;Linux distribution buildable from source&gt;.

= How to report Ubuntu crashes
{parent=Ubuntu HOWTO}

Their crash system does not have an amazing user interface.

Tested on &lt;Ubuntu 21.10&gt;.

After something crashes, look under `/var/crash` for a crash file, which helps to determine which package to report under on &lt;Launchpad (website)&gt;.

E.g. a file `/var/crash/_usr_sbin_gdm3.0.crash` makes you want to file the bug under gdm at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm/+filebug

Then, while reporting the bug, you want to give the developpers access to that `.crash` file. But you can't publicly upload it because it contains memory dumps and could contain secret information. The way to do it is to look at the ID under:
``
sudo cat /var/crash/_usr_sbin_gdm3.0.uploaded
``
Ubuntu's crash report system has already uploaded the `.crash` for you, so you just have to confirm it and give the ID on the ticket.

You can view a list of all your uploaded errors at:
``
xdg-open https://errors.ubuntu.com/user/$(sudo cat /var/lib/whoopsie/whoopsie-id)
``
and each of those contain a link to:
``
https://errors.ubuntu.com/oops/&lt;.uloaded error id&gt;
``
which you yourself cannot see.

https://askubuntu.com/questions/434431/how-can-i-read-a-crash-file-from-var-crash asks how to read the `.crash` files.

= Compiling Linux kernel for Ubuntu
{synonym}

This section describes our attempts at compiling the &lt;Linux kernel&gt; for &lt;Ubuntu&gt; so as to use the exact patches and build configuration as used for a given &lt;Ubuntu release&gt;. The same toolchain would also be ideal, but perhaps this would require a &lt;Linux distribution buildable from source&gt;.

https://canonical-kteam-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/public/how-to/build-kernel.html seems promising it says that for &lt;Ubuntu 24.04&gt; and above you should do the following which was tested on &lt;Ubuntu 24.10&gt;:

``
sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list~
sudo sed -Ei 's/^# deb-src /deb-src /' /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt build-dep -y linux linux-image-unsigned-$(uname -r)
sudo apt install -y fakeroot llvm libncurses-dev dwarves
apt source linux-image-unsigned-$(uname -r)
~/tmp/ubuntu/linux-6.11.0
cd linux-6.11.0
chmod a+x debian/rules
chmod a+x debian/scripts/*
chmod a+x debian/scripts/misc/*
fakeroot debian/rules clean
fakeroot debian/rules binary
``

The build is extremely slow compared to a build of a more embedded and specifically targeted minimal kernel, and took about 2 hours on &lt;Ciro Santilli's hardware/P14s&gt;. Their philosophy is likely to enable as many drivers as possible so that a single download will work for everyone. Which makes sense, fair enough. It would be cute though if there was a smarter way. Oh well.

After it finally finishes the build including our &lt;vmlinux&gt; is present at:

``

Happened on &lt;ciro santilli s hardware/P14s&gt; on &lt;Ubuntu 23.10&gt;, which started with fresh Ubuntu 23.10 install.

However it did not happen on &lt;ciro santilli s hardware/Lenovo ThinkPad P51 (2017)&gt; also on &lt;Ubuntu 23.10&gt; which had been upgraded several times from God knows what starting point... At first one had X11 (forced by &lt;Nvidia&gt; drivers) and the other Wayland, but moving to p14s X11 changed nothing.

On &lt;ciro santilli s hardware/Lenovo ThinkPad P51 (2017)&gt;.

Switching to the other installed kernel, 5.9 made boot work.

The solution on kernel 6.2 was:
``
sudo apt instal nvidia-driver-515
``
as per comments under: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2012559[]. This also made the nvidia driver work: &lt;Find GPU information in Ubuntu&gt;.

Previously I had:
``
nvidia-driver-510
``
and it blew up before reaching disk decryption.

I also tried:
``
nvidia-driver-525
``
but that broke in a different way:
``

Reported at: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-470/+bug/1953674

On &lt;ciro santilli s hardware/Lenovo ThinkPad P51 (2017)&gt;.

Does not happen every time, only some times. Can't figure out why. Usually happens when has suspended for a longer time.

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-470/+bug/1946303 sounds like a likely report, &lt;Nvidia&gt; driver version 470, but can't find those error messages anywhere. The last line of:
``
journalctl -o short-precise -k -b -1
``
once was:
``
PM: suspend entry (deep)
``
which is when sleep starts.

This suggests that it is not a video bug then, seems that it is not waking up at all? Gotta try to SSH into it. OK. I did SSH into it, and that was fine, so it is just the video that won't start.

``
PM: suspend exit
``

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1949977 is another possible bug, based on kernel version. I'm running 5.13, which is one of the failing versions on the report. Can't find any interesting dmesg though.

= Molecular biology feels like systems programming
{parent=Systems programming}
{wiki}

Whenever &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; learns about molecular biology, he can't help but to feel that it feels like programming, and notably systems programming and computer hardware design.

In some sense, the comparison is obvious: &lt;DNA&gt; is clearly a programmable medium like any &lt;assembly language&gt;, but still, systems programming did give Ciro some further feelings.

* The most important analogy perhaps is observability, or more precisely the lack of it. For the computer, this is described at: &lt;The lower level you go into a computer, the harder it is to observe things&gt;.

  And then, when Ciro started learning a bit about biology techniques, he started to feel the exact same thing.

  For example when he played with &lt;E. Coli Whole Cell Model by Covert Lab&gt;, the main thing Ciro felt was: it is going to be hard to verify any of this data, because it is hard/impossible to know the concentration of each element in a cell as a function of time.

  More generally of course, this is exactly why making any biology discovery is so hard: we can't easily see what's going on inside the cell, and have to resort to indirect ways of doing so..

  This exact idea was highlighted by &lt;I should have loved biology by James Somers&gt;:
  &gt; For a computer scientist, a biologist's methods can seem insane; the trouble comes from the fact that cells are too small, too numerous, too complex to analyze the way a programmer would, say in a &lt;step debugger&gt;[step-by-step debugger].

  And then just like in software, some of the methods biologists use to overcome the lack of visibility have direct software analogues:
  * add &lt;instrumentation (software)&gt; to cells, e.g. &lt;GFP tagging&gt; comes to mind
  * &lt;emulation&gt;, e.g. &lt;E. Coli Whole Cell Model by Covert Lab&gt;
* The boot process is another one. E.g. in &lt;x86&gt; the way that you start in 16-bit mode, largely compatible into the 70's, then move to 32-bit and finally 64, does feel a lot the way a earlier stages of embryo development looks more and more like more ancient animals.

Ciro likes to think that maybe that is why a hardcore &lt;systems programmer&gt; like &lt;Bert Hubert&gt; got into molecular biology.

Some other people who mention similar things:
* &lt;I should have loved biology by James Somers&gt; highlights the &lt;How computers work?&gt;[computer abstraction layer] analogy between the two:
  &gt; Everywhere you look - the &lt;compiler&gt;, the shell, the &lt;CPU&gt;, the DOM - is an abstraction hiding lifetimes of work.

Docker is good.

As a lightweight virtualization however, it does break more often than full proper virtualization like &lt;QEMU&gt; after some updates.

The images also appear to randomly update slightly and break things, even though you've specified e.g.:
``
FROM ubuntu:20.04
``

Also, we need more &lt;Linux distributions buildable from source&gt;, especially with &lt;Reproducible builds&gt;.

= User mode emulation
{parent=QEMU}

&lt;User mode emulation&gt; refers to the ability of certain &lt;emulators&gt; to emulate userland code running on top of a specific &lt;operating system&gt;, usually &lt;Linux&gt;.

For example, &lt;QEMU&gt; allows you to run a variety of userland &lt;ELF&gt; programs directly on it, without an underlying &lt;Linux kernel&gt; running.

User mode emulation is achieved by implementing &lt;system calls&gt; and special filesystems such as `/dev` manually on the emulator one by one.

The general tradeoff is that simulation is less acurate as it may lack certain highly advanced kernel functionality you haven't implemented yet. But it is much easier to run executables with it, and you don't have to wait for boot to finish before running, you just run executables directly from the command line.

Unofrtunately as of 2025 the project was falling a bit back on support, and the latest versions of the two closed source systems were buggy, tested as of quickemu 4.9.7 on &lt;Ubuntu 25.04&gt;:
* &lt;Windows 11&gt;: https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu/issues/1475
* &lt;MacOS 14&gt; (Sonoma) installs &lt;MacOS 15&gt;, which is not listed on the list of installable systems: https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu/issues/1561[]. The issue was closed, but it still happens.

This would serve as a good workaround for the lack of clipboard and the default annoyiance of mouse capture!

I don't see how to get it working out of box immediately, but after you do on guest:
``
sudo apt install openssh-server
``
then the host terminal tells you the ssh command e.g.:
``
ssh user@localhost -p 22220
``
and that worked. You can also &lt;quickemu&gt; with:
``
quickemu --display none
``
to not get any annoying GUI.

All stuff Ciro cares about too! Cool dude! In particular Ciro loved &lt;quote i should have loved biology by james somers intro&gt;[his quote of I should have loved biology].

He's writing a fun-sounding book about &lt;molecular biology&gt; as of 2022: https://berthub.eu/dna-book[]. Appears to be closed source though. Ciro wonders if he really needs to sell the book for money after all those years though, rather than just publishing it online for free.

Looking at Bert just brings the &lt;Dutch Golden Age&gt;, and more in particular &lt;Antonie van Leeuwenhoek&gt; to mind. Epic.

Creator of &lt;QEMU&gt; and &lt;FFmpeg&gt;, both of which &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; deeply respects. And a bunch other random stuff.

What is shocking about Fabrice this is that both are insanely important software that &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; really likes, and both seem to be completely unrelated subjects!

&lt;Google&gt; made billions on top of this dude:
* &lt;FFmpeg is the backend of YouTube&gt;
* &lt;QEMU&gt; is the default emulator for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Studio[Android Studio] as of 2019, which &lt;Android&gt; developers use by default under the hood to develop Android Apps on their desktop without the need for a real device.

At last but not least, Fabrice also studied in the same school that &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; studied in France, &lt;École Polytechnique&gt;.

It is a shame that he keeps such a low profile, there are no videos of him on the web, and he https://smartbear.com/blog/test-and-monitor/fabrice-bellard-portrait-of-a-super-productive-pro/[declines interviews].

Another surprising fact is that Fabrice has not worked for the "Big Tech Companies" as far as can be publicly seen, but rather mostly on smaller companies that he co-founded: https://www.quora.com/Computer-Programmers/Computer-Programmers-Where-is-Fabrice-Bellard-employed

And he's also into some completely random projcts unsurprisingly:

Creator of &lt;Mozilla rr&gt;, of which &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; is a huge fan of!

He quit Mozilla in 2016 to try and commercialize an `rr` extension called &lt;Pernosco&gt;.

But as of 2022, he advertised himself as part of "&lt;Google&gt; Research", so maybe that went under, sample source: https://archive.ph/o9622[]. TODO when did he start? There's apparently an unrelated homonym: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-ocallahan/

He's apparently very religious, and very New Zelandish, https://twitter.com/rocallahan[] auto-describes:
&gt; Christian. Repatriate Kiwi.
&lt;Terry A. Davis&gt; and &lt;D. Richard Hipp&gt; come to mind. One is tempted to speculate a correlation even, the proportion amongst systems programmers feels so much higher than in other areas of programming! Maybe it is because you have to be a God to do it in the first place.
