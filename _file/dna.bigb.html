= DNA detection
{c}
{parent=DNA}

DNA detection means determining if a specific DNA sequence is present in a sample.

This can be used to detect if a given species of microorganism is present in a sample, and is therefore a widely used diagnostics technique to see if someone is infected with a virus.

You could of course do full &lt;DNA sequencing&gt;[DNA Sequencing] to see everything that is there, but since it is as a more generic procedure, sequencing is more expensive and slow.

The alternative is to use a &lt;DNA amplification&gt; technique.

= DNA amplification
{c}
{parent=DNA}
{wiki}

DNA amplification is one of the key DNA technologies:
* it is one of the main ways in which &lt;DNA detection&gt; can be done.
* it is the first step of &lt;Illumina&gt;[Illumina sequencing], since you need multiple copies of several parts of the genome for the method to work

= Polymerase chain reaction
{parent=DNA amplification}
{wiki}

= PCR
{c}
{synonym}
{title2}

This is an extremely widely used technique as of 2020 and much earlier.

If allows you to amplify "any" sequence of choice (TODO length limitations) between a start and end sequences of interest which you synthesize.

If the sequence of interest is present, it gets amplified exponentially, and you end up with a bunch of DNA at the end.

You can then measure the DNA concentration based on simple light refraction methods to see if there is a lot of DNA or not in the post-processed sample.

Even &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; had some contact with it at: &lt;oxford nanopore river bacteria&gt;{full}, see: &lt;oxford nanopore river bacteria/PCR&gt;!

One common problem that happens with PCR if you don't design your primers right is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_dimer

Sometime it fails: https://www.reddit.com/r/molecularbiology/comments/1kouomw/when_your_pcr_fails_again_and_you_start/
&gt; Nothing humbles you faster than a bandless gel. One minute you’re a scientist, the next you’re just a pipette-wielding wizard casting spells that don’t work. Meanwhile, physicists are out there acting like gravity always behaves. Smash that upvote if your reagents have ever gaslit you.
and a comment:
&gt; PCR = Pray, Cry, Repeat

= Real-time polymerase chain reaction
{parent=Polymerase chain reaction}
{wiki}

Also known as: Quantitative PCR (qPCR).

Like PCR, but the amplification machine measures the concentration of DNA at each step.

This describes one possible concentration detection method with &lt;fluorescence&gt;[fluorescent] molecules that only become fluorescent when the DNA is double stranded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYBR_Green_I[SYBR Green])

\Video[http://youtube.com/watch?v=YhXj5Yy4ksQ]
{title=Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) - Quantitative PCR (qPCR) by Applied Biological Materials (2016)}

This allows you to predict the exact initial concentration by extrapolating the exponential curve backwards.

TODO: vs non-real-time PCR. Why can't you just divide by 2 for every heating step to reach back the original concentration? Likely the reaction reach saturation at an unknown step.

TODO: vs non-real-time PCR in medical diagnostics: do you really need to know concentration for diagnostics? Isn't it enough to know if the virus is present or not?

= Isothermal DNA amplification techniques
{parent=Polymerase chain reaction}

Isothermal means "at fixed temperature".

This is to contrast with the more well established &lt;polymerase chain reaction&gt;, which requires heating and cooling the sample several times.

The obvious advantage of isothermal methods is that their machinery can be simpler and cheaper, and the process can happen faster, since you don't have to do through heating and cooling cycles.

= Loop-mediated isothermal amplification
{parent=Isothermal DNA amplification techniques}
{title2=LAMP}
{wiki}

Like PCR, but does not require thermal cycling. Thus the "isothermal" in the name: iso means same, so "same temperature".

Not needing the thermo cycling means that the equipment needed is much smaller and cheaper it seems.

Most of these are going to be &lt;Whole-genome sequencing&gt; of some &lt;model organism&gt;:

* &lt;single-nucleotide polymorphism&gt;: specificity is high enough to detect snips

= Metagenomics
{parent=DNA sequencing}
{wiki}

Experiments that involve sequencing bulk DNA found in a sample to determine what species are present, as opposed to sequencing just a single specific specimen. Examples of samples that are often used:
* river water to determine which bacteria are present, notably to determine if the water is free of dangerous bacteria. A concrete example is shown at: &lt;oxford nanopore river bacteria&gt;{full}.
* sea water biodiversity: http://ocean-microbiome.embl.de/companion.html
* &lt;food&gt;, including searching for desirable microorganisms such as in cheese or bread &lt;yeast&gt;
* &lt;poo&gt;, e.g. to study how the human microbiome influences health. There are companies actively working on this, e.g.: https://www.microbiotica.com/

One related application which most people would not consider metagenomics, is that of finding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulating_tumor_DNA[circulating tumor DNA] in blood to detect tumors.

{parent=DNA sequencing company}
{tag=American company}
{wiki=Illumina,_Inc.}

The by far dominating DNA sequencing company of the late 2000's and 2010's due to having the smallest cost per base pair.

Illumina actually bought their 2010's dominating technology from a &lt;Cambridge&gt; company called &lt;Solexa&gt;.

To understand how Illumina's technology works basically, watch this video: &lt;video illumina sequencing by synthesis&gt;.

\Video[http://youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8]
{title=Illumina Sequencing by Synthesis by &lt;Illumina&gt; (2016)}
{id=video-illumina-sequencing-by-synthesis}

The key innovation of this method is the &lt;Bridge amplification&gt; step, which produces a large amount of identical DNA strands.

= Bridge amplification
{c}
{parent=Illumina}
{wiki=Illumina_dye_sequencing\#Bridge_amplification}

This is one of the the key innovations of the &lt;Illumina&gt; (originally &lt;Solexa&gt;) sequencing.

This step is genius because sequencing is basically a &lt;signal-to-noise&gt; problem, as you are trying to observe individual tiny nucleotides mixed with billions of other tiny nucleotides.

With bridge amplification, we group some of the nucleotides together, and multiply the signal millions of times for that part of the DNA.

Bought by &lt;Illumina&gt; https://www.reuters.com/article/us-illumina-solexa/illumina-to-buy-genome-firm-solexa-for-600-mln-idUSN1348062320061113[for 600 million in 2007 for 600 million dollars].

This is one of the prime examples of &lt;Europe&gt;'s decline.

Instead of trying to dominate the sequencing market and gain trillions of dollars from it, they local British early stage investors were more than happy to get a 20x return on their small initial investments, and sold out to the Americans who will then make the real profit.

And now Solexa doesn't even have its own &lt;Wikipedia&gt; page, while Illumina is set out to be the next &lt;Microsoft&gt;. What a disgrace.

Here are some good articles about the company:
* http://www.bio-itworld.com/2010/issues/sept-oct/solexa.html (https://web.archive.org/web/20190411005034/http://www.bio-itworld.com/2010/issues/sept-oct/solexa.html[archive]).

Cambridge visitors can still visit the https://pantonarms.co.uk/[Panton Arms pub], which was the location of the legendary "hey we should talk" founders meeting, chosen due to its proximity to the chemistry department of the &lt;University of Cambridge&gt;.

In 2021 the founders were awarded the &lt;Breakthrough Prize&gt;. The third person awarded was Pascal Mayer. He was apparently at Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute at the time of development. They do have a wiki page unlike Solexa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serono[]. They paid a 700 million fine in 2005 in the &lt;United States&gt;, and sold out in 2006 to &lt;Merck&gt; for 10 billion USD.

= De novo DNA synthesis
{parent=DNA}
{wiki=De_novo_synthesis}

As of 2018, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; believes that this could be &lt;the next big thing&gt; in &lt;biology&gt; technology.

"De novo" means "starting from scratch", that is: you type the desired sequence into a computer, and the synthesize it.

The "de novo" part is important, because it distinguishes this from the already well solved problem of duplicating DNA from an existing DNA template, which is what all our cells do daily, and which can already be done very efficiently &lt;in vitro&gt; with &lt;polymerase chain reaction&gt;.

Many &lt;De novo DNA synthesis company&gt;[companies are attempting to create more efficient de novo synthesis methods]:
* https://twistbioscience.com/
* https://www.evonetix.com/technology/
* &lt;DNAScript&gt;
* https://www.ansabio.com/
* https://www.nuclera.com/

Notably, the dream of most of those companies is to have a machine that sits on a lab bench, which synthesises whatever you want.

TODO current de novo synthesis costs/time to delivery after ordering a custom sequence.

The initial main applications are likely going to be:
* &lt;polymerase chain reaction&gt; primers (determine which region will be amplified
* creating a custom sequence to be inserted in a &lt;plasmid&gt;, i.e. &lt;artificial gene synthesis&gt;
but the real pipe dream is building and bootstraping entire &lt;artificial chromosomes&gt;

* add them with the enzyme. They use a werid &lt;DNA polymerase&gt; called &lt;terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase&gt; that adds a base at a time to a single stranded DNA strand rather than copying from a template
* wash everything
* do deblocking reaction
* and then repeat until done

Synthesizing the DNA itself is not the only problem however.

You then have to get that DNA into a working living form state so that normal cell processes can continue:
* for &lt;viri&gt; see: &lt;synthetic virus&gt;
* for bacteria, you have to inject it into a cell
* for placental animals, you also have to somehow simulate a compatible placenta. It is likely easier for eggs.

Is it easy to &lt;transfect&gt; a cell with the synthesized DNA, and get it to generate full infectious viral particles?

If so, then &lt;de novo DNA synthesis&gt; would be very similar to 3D printed guns: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printed_firearms[].

{wiki}

The first found and most important known &lt;epigenetic&gt; marker.

Happens only on &lt;adenine&gt; and &lt;cytosine&gt;. &lt;Adenine methylation&gt; is much less common in &lt;mammal&gt; than &lt;cytosine&gt; methylation, when people say "methylation" they often mean just cytosine methylation.

It often happens on &lt;promoters&gt;, where it inhibits &lt;transcription&gt;.

= Operon vs transcription unit
{parent=Operon}
{wiki}

Consider the &lt;E. Coli K-12 MG1655 operon thrLABC&gt;.

That single &lt;operon&gt; can produce two different &lt;mRNA&gt; &lt;transcription units&gt;:
* thrL only, the transcription unit is also called thrL: https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?object=TU0-42486
* thrL + thrA + thrB + thrC all together, the transcription unit is called thrLABC: https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?type=OPERON&amp;object=TU00178

The reason for this appears to be that there is a &lt;rho-independent termination&gt; region after thrL. But then under certain conditions, that must get innactivated, and then the thrLABC is produced instead.

= DNA replication is a key limiting factor of bacterial replication time
{c}
{parent=Evolutionary genetics}

TODO confirm, but looks like it, e.g. &lt;E. Coli starts DNA replication before the previous one finished&gt;.

= It is hard for complex organisms to evolve because longer DNA means longer replication time
{parent=DNA replication is a key limiting factor of bacterial replication time}

Because &lt;DNA replication is a key limiting factor of bacterial replication time&gt;, such organisms are therefore strongly incentivized to have very minimal DNAs.

&lt;Power, Sex, Suicide by Nick Lane (2006)&gt; 7 "Why bacteria are simple" page 169 puts this nicely:
&gt; Bacteria replicate at colossal speed. \[...\] In two days, the mass of exponentially doubling E. coli would be 2664 times larger than the mass of the &lt;Earth&gt;.

  Luckily this does not happen, and the reason is that bacteria are normally half starved. They swiftly consume all available food, whereupon their growth is limited once again by the lack of nutrients. Most bacteria spend most of their lives in stasis, waiting for a meal. Nonetheless, the speed at which bacteria do mobilize themselves to replicate upon feeding illustrates the overwhelming strength of the selection pressures at work.

= Comparative genomics
{parent=Genetics}
{wiki}

= Parasites tend to have smaller DNAs
{parent=Comparative genomics}

If you live in the relatively food abundant environment of another cell, then you don't have to be able to digest every single food source in existence, of defend against a wide range of predators.

So because &lt;DNA replication is a key limiting factor of bacterial replication time&gt;, you just reduce your genome to a minimum.

And likely you also want to be as small as possible to evade the host's &lt;immune system&gt;.

&lt;Power, Sex, Suicide by Nick Lane (2006)&gt; section "Gene loss as an evolutionary trajectory" puts it well:
&gt; One of the most extreme examples of gene loss is Rickettsia prowazekii, the cause of typhus. \[...\] Over evolutionary time Rickettsia has lost most of its genes, and now has a mere  protein-coding genes left. \[...\] Rickettsia is a tiny bacterium, almost as small as a virus, which lives as a parasite inside other cells. It is so well adapted to this lifestyle that it can no longer survive outside its host cells. \[...\] It was able to lose most of its genes in this way simply because they were not needed: life inside other cells, if you can survive there at all, is a spoonfed existence.
and also section "How to lose the cell wall without dying" page 184 has some related mentions:
&gt; While many types of bacteria do lose their cell wall during parts of their life cycle only two groups of prokaryotes have succeeded in losing their cell walls permanently, yet lived to tell the tale. It's interesting to consider the extenuating circumstances that permitted them to do so.

  \[...\]

  One group, the Mycoplasma, comprises mostly parasites, many of which live inside other cells. Mycoplasma cells are tiny, with very small genomes. M. genitalium, discovered in 1981, has the smallest known genome of any bacterial cell, encoding fewer than 500 genes. &lt;M. genitalium&gt;, discovered in 1981, has the smallest known genome of any bacterial cell, encoding fewer than 500 genes. \[...\] Like Rickettsia, Mycoplasma have lost virtually all the genes required for making nucleotides, &lt;amino acids&gt;, and so forth.

The term is sometimes just used a synonym for &lt;horizontal gene transfer&gt; in general it seems however.
