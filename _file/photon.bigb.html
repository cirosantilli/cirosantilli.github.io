Initially light was though of as a wave because it experienced interference as shown by experiments such as:
* &lt;double-slit experiment&gt;
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_rings

But then, some key experiments also start suggesting that &lt;light&gt; is made up of &lt;discrete&gt; packets:
* &lt;Compton scattering&gt;, also suggests that photons carry momentum
* &lt;photoelectric effect&gt;
* &lt;single photon production and detection experiments&gt;
and in the understanding of the 2020 &lt;Standard Model&gt; the photon is one of the &lt;elementary particles&gt;.

This duality is fully described mathematically by &lt;quantum electrodynamics&gt;, where the photon is modelled as a quantized excitation of the photon field.

The history of light if funny.

First people thought it was a particle, as per &lt;corpuscular theory of light&gt;, notably &lt;Newton supported the corpuscular theory of light&gt;.

But then evidence of the &lt;diffraction&gt; of light start to become unbearably strong, culminating in the &lt;Arago spot&gt;.

And finally it was understood from &lt;Maxwell's equations&gt; that light is a form of &lt;electromagnetic radiation&gt;, as its speed was perfectly predicted by the theory.

But then evidence of particle nature started to surface once again with the &lt;photoelectric effect&gt;. Physicists must have been driven mad by all these changes.

&lt;The Quantum Story by Jim Baggott (2011)&gt; page 2 mentions how &lt;Newton supported the corpuscular theory of light&gt;[newton's support for the corpuscular theory of light] led it to be held for a very long time, even when evidence of the &lt;wave theory of light&gt; was becoming overwhelming.

These are closely related to &lt;lasers&gt;, as they do a similar basic job: take a &lt;DC source&gt; as input and amplify &lt;light&gt;. &lt;Lasers&gt; just happen to use the input voltage to also generate the incoming light.

It's the thing that allows you to connect &lt;fiber optics&gt; into a compter, or the corresponding port for the thing.

Many of them can take two fibers as input/output because &lt;fiber optics cables often come in pairs because it is needed for duplex&gt;.

= Single-mode and multi-mode optical fiber
{parent=Fiber-optic communication}

= Single-mode and multi-mode fiber
{synonym}

From a practical point of view &lt;Single-mode optical fiber&gt;[single-mode]:
* upside: can go further without a &lt;#repeater&gt;. In &lt;multi-mode optical fiber&gt;, different modes travel at different speeds, and start interfering with each other at some point
* downside: lower &lt;#bandwitdh&gt;, because we can fit less modes into it
As such, typical applications are:
* &lt;single-mode optical fiber&gt;: longer distance communications across buildings and cities
* &lt;multi-mode optical fiber&gt;: shorter distance communications e.g. within a single &lt;#data center&gt;

Then there are some more hardcore threads actually pondering about specific cost trade-offs:
* https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/n2tgeu/why_use_multimode_fiber_when_you_can_use/
* https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/ucm55k/single_mode_vs_multimode_fiber/

From a mathematical point of view:
* multi-mode: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Optical_fiber&amp;oldid=1229833804#Multi-mode_fiber[]:
  &gt; Fiber with large core diameter (greater than 10 micrometers) may be analyzed by &lt;#geometrical optics&gt;. Such fiber is called &lt;multi-mode fiber&gt;. In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by &lt;#total internal reflection&gt;.

  \Image[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Optical-fibre.svg]
* single-mode: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Optical_fiber&amp;oldid=1229833804#Single-mode_fiber[]:
  &gt; Fiber with a core diameter less than about ten times the wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic waveguide structure, according to Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called single-mode.

  \Image[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Optical_fibres_modes_vs_wavelength.gif]

Another difference is that &lt;single-mode fiber&gt; usually uses &lt;lasers&gt; as the light soruce, while &lt;multi-mode fiber&gt; usually uses &lt;LED&gt;:

This section is about stuff efficiently getting light into or out of &lt;optical fibers&gt;, or joining two optical fibers together end to end so that light goes through.

Historically this has been an important development, as it is much harder than with wires since &lt;optical fiber&gt; has to be very narrow to work properly, e.g. this is mentioned a lot in &lt;City of Light: The Story of Fiber Optics&gt;.

= Faster-than-light
{parent=Speed of light}
{title2=FTL}
{wiki}

In &lt;special relativity&gt;, it is impossible to travel faster than light.

One argument of why, is that if you could travel faster than light, then you could send a message to a point in &lt;Spacetime&gt; that is &lt;spacelike-separated&gt; from the present. But then since the target is spacelike separated, there exists a &lt;inertial frame of reference&gt; in which that event happens before the present, which would be hard to make sense of.

Even worse, it would be possible to travel back in time:

{parent=Radio wave}
{title2=1 mm - 1 m}

{wiki}

Micro means "small wavelength compared to &lt;radio waves&gt;", not &lt;micron&gt;-sized.

Microwave production and detection is incredibly important in many modern applications:
* &lt;telecommunications&gt;, e.g. being used in
  * &lt;Wi-Fi&gt;
  * satellite communications

    https://youtu.be/EYovBJR6l5U?list=PL-_93BVApb58SXL-BCv4rVHL-8GuC2WGb&amp;t=27 from &lt;CuriousMarc&gt; comments on some piece of Apollo equipment they were restoring/reversing:
    &gt; These are the boxes that brought you voice, data and live TV from the moon, and should be early masterpieces of microwave electronics, the blackest of black arts in analog electronics.
    Ah, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; really wishes he knew what that meant more precisely. Sounds so cool!
  * &lt;4G&gt; and other &lt;cellular network&gt; standards
* &lt;radar&gt;. As an example, &lt;1965 Nobel Prize in Physics laureate&gt; &lt;Julian Schwinger&gt; did some notable work in the area in &lt;World War II&gt;, while most other physicists went to the &lt;Manhattan Project&gt; instead.

  This is well highlighted in &lt;QED and the men who made itby Silvan Schweber (1994)&gt;. Designing the cavity wasn't easy. One of the key initial experiments of &lt;quantum electrodynamics&gt;, the &lt;Lamb-Retherford experiment&gt; from 1947, fundamental for modern physics, was a direct consequence of post-radar research by physicists who started to apply wartime developments to their scientific search.

  Wikipedia also mentions https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microwave&amp;oldid=1093188913#Radar_2[]:
  &gt; The first modern silicon and germanium diodes were developed as microwave detectors in the 1930s, and the principles of semiconductor physics learned during their development led to semiconductor electronics after the war.
* microwave is the natural frequency of several important &lt;Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics&gt; phenomena, and has been used extensively in &lt;quantum computing&gt; applications, including completely different types of &lt;quantum computer type&gt;:
  * &lt;trapped ion quantum computer&gt;; &lt;video Trapping Ions for Quantum Computing by Diana Craik (2019)&gt;
  * &lt;superconducting quantum computer&gt;; e.g. this Junior Microwave Design Engineer job accouncement from &lt;Alice&amp;Bob&gt;: https://archive.ph/wip/4wGPJ
  Likely part of the appeal of microwaves is that they are &lt;non-ionizing&gt;, so you don't destroy stuff. But at the same time, they are much more compatible with atomic scale energies than radio waves, which have way way too little energy.

{description=
Very short whiteboard video by Peter Mosley from the University of Bath, but it's worth it for newbs. Basically describes &lt;spontaneous parametric down-conversion&gt;.

One interesting thing he mentions is that you could get single photons by making your sunglasses thicker and thicker to reduce how many photons pass, but one big downside problem is that then you don't know when the photon is going to come through, that becomes essentially random, and then you can't use this technique if you need two photons at the same time, which is often the case, see also: &lt;two photon interference experiment&gt;.

= Biconvex spherical lens
{parent=Lens}

Focal length

Each side is a sphere section. They don't have to have the same radius, they are still simple to understand with different radiuses.

The two things you have to have in mind that this does are:
* converges &lt;parallel light&gt; to a point at center at distance $f$ known as the &lt;focal length&gt;.

  This is for example why you can use lenses to burn things with &lt;Sun&gt; rays, which are basically parallel.

  Conversely, if the input is a &lt;point light source&gt; at the &lt;focal length&gt;, it gets converted into &lt;parallel light&gt;.
* image formation: it converges all rays coming from a given source point to a single point image. This amplifies the signal, and forms an image at a plane.

  The source image can be far away, and the virtual image can be close to the lens. This is exactly what we need for a camera.

  For each distance on one side, it only works for another distance on the other side. So when we set the distance between the lens and the detector, this sets the distance of the source object, i.e. the focus. The equation is:
  $$
  \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{S_1} + \frac{1}{S_2}
  $$
  where $S_1$ and $S_2$ are the two distances.

= Photon polarization
{parent=Photonics}
{wiki}

The knowledge that light is polarized precedes the knowledge of the existence of the photon, see &lt;polarization of light&gt; for the classical point of view.

The polarization state and how it can be decomposed into different modes can be well visualized with the &lt;Poincaré sphere&gt;.

One key idea about photon polarization is that it carries &lt;angular momentum&gt;. Therefore, when an electron changes orbitals in the &lt;Schrödinger equation solution for the hydrogen atom&gt;, the angular momentum (as well as energy) change is carried out by the polarization of the &lt;photon&gt;!

This section discusses the pre-&lt;photon&gt; understanding of the &lt;polarization of light&gt;. For the photon one see: &lt;photon polarization&gt;.

https://polarization.com/history/history.html is a good page.

People were a bit confused when experiments started to show that light might be polarized. How could a wave that propages through a 3D homgenous material like &lt;luminiferous aether&gt; have polarization?? Light would presumably be understood to be analogous to a sound wave in 3D medium, which cannot have polarization. This was before &lt;Maxwell's equations&gt;, in the early 19th century, so there was no way to know.

Particularly cool is to see how &lt;Fresnel&gt; fully understood that light is somehow polarized, even though he did not know &lt;electromagnetic theory of light&gt;[that it was made out of electromagnetism], clear indication of which only came with the &lt;Faraday effect&gt; in 1845.

https://spie.org/publications/fg05_p03_maluss_law[]:
&gt; At the beginning of the nineteenth century the only known way to generate polarized light was with a calcite crystal. In 1808, using a calcite crystal, Malus discovered that natural incident light became polarized when it was reflected by a glass surface, and that the light reflected close to an angle of incidence of 57° could be extinguished when viewed through the crystal. He then proposed that natural light consisted of the s- and p-polarizations, which were perpendicular to each other.
