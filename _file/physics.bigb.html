Physics (like all well done &lt;science&gt;) is the &lt;art&gt; of predicting the future by modelling the world with &lt;mathematics&gt;.

And predicting the future is the first step towards &lt;control engineering&gt;[controlling] it, i.e.: &lt;engineering&gt;.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; doesn't know physics. He writes about it partly to start playing with some scientific content for: &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt;, partly because this stuff is just amazingly beautiful.

Ciro's main intellectual &lt;physics&gt; &lt;fetishes&gt; are to learn &lt;quantum electrodynamics&gt; (understanding the point of &lt;Lie groups&gt; being a subpart of that) and &lt;condensed matter physics&gt;.

Every science &lt;reductionism&gt;[is Physics in disguise], but the number of objects in the real world is so large that we can't solve the real equations in practice.

Luckily, due to &lt;emergence&gt;, we can use uglier higher level approximations of the world to solve many problems, with the complex limits of applicability of those approximations.

Therefore, such higher level approximations are highly specialized, and given different names such as:
* &lt;chemistry&gt;
* &lt;biology&gt;

As of 2019, all known physics can be described by two theories:
* the &lt;Standard Model&gt;
* &lt;general relativity&gt;

Unifying those two into the &lt;theory of everything&gt; one of the major goals of modern physics.

= How to teach and learn physics
{parent=Physics}
{tag=Essays by Ciro Santilli}

The approach many courses take to physics, specially "modern Physics" is really bad, this is how it should be taught:
* start by describing experiments that the previous best theory did not explain, see also: &lt;physics education needs more focus on understanding experiments and their history&gt;{full}
* then, give the final formula for the next best theory
* then, give all the important final implications of that formula, and how it amazingly describes the experiments. In particular this means: &lt;doing physics means calculating a number&gt;
* then, give some mathematical intuition on the formulas, and how the main equation could have been derived
* finally, then and only then, start deriving the outcomes of the main formula in detail

This is likely because at some point, experiments get more and more complicated, and so people are tempted to say "this is the truth" instead of "this is why we think this is the truth", which is much harder.

But we can't be lazy, there is no replacement to the why.

= Physics education needs more focus on understanding experiments and their history
{parent=How to teach and learn physics}
{tag=Cirism}

This is the only way to truly understand and appreciate the subject.

Understanding the experiments gets intimately entangled with basically learning the &lt;history of physics&gt;, which is extremely beneficial as also highlighted by &lt;Ron Maimon&gt;, related: &lt;there is value in tutorials written by early pioneers of the field&gt;.

"How we know" is a basically more fundamental point than "what we know" in the natural sciences.

In the &lt;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman chapter O Americano, Outra Vez!&gt; &lt;Richard Feynman&gt; describes his experience teaching in &lt;Brazil&gt; in the early 1950s, and how everything was memorized, without any explanation of the experiments or that the theory has some relationship to the real world!

Although things have improved considerably since in Brazil, Ciro still feels that some areas of physics are still taught without enough experiments described upfront. Notably, ironically, &lt;quantum field theory&gt;, which is where Feynman himself worked.

Feynman gave huge importance to understanding and explaining experiments, as can also be seen on &lt;Richard Feynman Quantum Electrodynamics Lecture at University of Auckland (1979)&gt;.

= There is value in tutorials written by early pioneers of the field
{parent=Physics education needs more focus on understanding experiments and their history}
{tag=Cirism}

Everyone is beginner when the field is new, and &lt;there is value in tutorials written by beginners&gt;.

For example, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; felt it shocking how direct and satisfying &lt;Richard Feynman&gt;'s &lt;scientific vulgarization&gt; of &lt;quantum electrodynamics&gt; were, e.g. at: &lt;Richard Feynman Quantum Electrodynamics Lecture at University of Auckland (1979)&gt;, and that if he had just assumed minimal knowledge of &lt;mathematics&gt;, he was about to give a full satisfactory picture in just a few hours.

Other supporters of this:
* &lt;Ron Maimon&gt;: the same also applies to early original papers of the field, not just tutorials
* &lt;Dean Kamen&gt;: quick mention at: https://fi.edu/en/awards/laureates/dean-kamen[], but a better longer mention on Dreamer (2020), nearby section from trailer: https://youtu.be/Cj2VKVJKf1I?t=16

= Doing physics means calculating a number
{parent=How to teach and learn physics}
{tag=Cirism}

In Physics, in order to test a theory, you must be able to extract a number from it.

It does not matter how, if it is exact, or numerical, or a message from &lt;God&gt;: a number has to come out of the formulas in the end, and you have to compare it with the experimental data.

Many theoretical physicists seem to forget this in their lectures, see also: &lt;how to teach and learn physics&gt;{full}.

= Physics is a way to predict the future
{parent=Doing physics means calculating a number}

It is quite beautiful to look at it like that.

That which previous generations would treat as magical, and divine.

We are doing better and better right now.

Of course, in a way, humans are trying and often successfully predicting certain daily aspects of the future all the time. Will this car stop if I cross the road? Will this glass break if I drop it?

But there's a beauty to the level of precision that can be achieved with &lt;physics&gt; and other &lt;natural sciences&gt;.

= It is OK to treat things as black boxes
{parent=How to teach and learn physics}

Nature &lt;science is the reverse engineering of nature&gt;[is a black box, right]?

You don't need to understand the &lt;from first principles&gt; derivation of every single phenomena.

And most important of all: you should not start learning phenomena by reading the from first principles derivation.

Instead, you should see what happens in experiments, and how matches some known formula (which hopefully has been derived from first principles).

Only open the boxes (understand from first principles derivation) if the need is felt!

E.g.:
* you don't need to understand everything about why &lt;SQUID devices&gt; have their specific &lt;I-V curve&gt; curve. You have to first of all learn what the I-V curve would be in an experiment!
* you don't need to understand the fine details of how &lt;cavity magnetrons&gt; work. What you need to understand first is what kind of &lt;microwave&gt; you get from what kind of input (&lt;DC current&gt;), and how that compares to other sources of &lt;microwaves&gt;
* &lt;lasers&gt;: same

Physics is &lt;doing physics means calculating a number&gt;[all about predicting the future]. If you can predict the future with an end result, that's already predicting the future, and valid.

Classic theory predicts that the output frequency must be the same as the input one since the electromagnetic wave makes the electron vibrate with same frequency as itself, which then irradiates further waves.

But the output waves are longer because &lt;Planck-Einstein relation&gt;[photons are discrete and energy is proportional to frequency]:

The formula is exactly that of two &lt;relativistic&gt; billiard balls colliding.

Therefore this is evidence that &lt;photons&gt; exist and have momentum.

No matter how hight the wave intensity, if it the frequency is small, no photons are removed from the material.

This is different from classic waves where energy is proportional to intensity, and coherent with the &lt;photon&gt;[existence of photons] and the &lt;Planck-Einstein relation&gt;.

&lt;Quantum Field Theory lecture notes by David Tong (2007)&gt; puts it well:
&gt; In classical physics, the primary reason for introducing the concept of the &lt;field (physics)&gt; is to construct laws of Nature that are local. The old laws of Coulomb and Newton involve "action at a distance". This means that the force felt by an electron (or planet) changes immediately if a distant &lt;proton&gt; (or star) moves. This situation is philosophically unsatisfactory. More importantly, it is also experimentally wrong. The field theories of Maxwell and Einstein remedy the situation, with all interactions mediated in a local fashion by the field.
This is also mentioned e.g. at &lt;video The Quantum Experiment that ALMOST broke Locality by The Science Asylum (2019)&gt;.

{parent=Causality}
{wiki}

In simple terms, if you believe in the &lt;Schrödinger equation&gt; and its modern probabilistic interpretation as described in the &lt;Schrödinger picture&gt;, then at first it seem that there is no strict causality to the outcome of experiments.

People have then tried to recover that by assuming that there is some inner sate beyond the &lt;Schrödinger equation&gt;, but these ideas are refuted by &lt;Bell test experiments&gt;, unless we give up the &lt;principle of locality&gt;, which feels more important, especially in &lt;special relativity&gt;, where &lt;faster-than-light implies time travel&gt;, which breaks causality even more dramatically.

The &lt;de Broglie-Bohm theory&gt; is a deterministic but &lt;non-local&gt; formulation of quantum mechanics.

= Causality and quantum jumps are incompatible
{parent=Causality in quantum mechanics}

If something does a &lt;quantum jump&gt;, what causes it to decide doing so at a particular time and not another? It is expected that a continuous cause would have continuous effects.

This concern was raised immediately by &lt;Rutherford&gt; while reviewing the &lt;Bohr model&gt; in 1913 as mentioned in &lt;The Quantum Story by Jim Baggott (2011)&gt; page 32.

Ah, the jewel of &lt;computational physics&gt;.

Also known as an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_initio_quantum_chemistry_methods[ab initio] method: no experimental measurement is taken as input, &lt;quantum electrodynamics&gt;[QED is all you need].

But since QED is thought to fully describe all relevant aspects &lt;molecules&gt;, it could be called "the" ab initio method.

For one, if we were able to predict protein molecule interactions, our understanding of &lt;molecular biology technologies&gt; would be solved.

No more ultra expensive and complicated &lt;X-ray crystallography&gt; or &lt;cryogenic electron microscopy&gt;.

And the fact that &lt;quantum computers&gt; are one of the most promising advances to this field, is also very very exciting: &lt;quantum algorithm&gt;{full}.

&lt;QED and the men who made it: Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga by Silvan Schweber (1994)&gt; chapter 4.1 this conference was soon compared to the &lt;First Solvay Conference (1911)&gt;, which set in motion the development of &lt;non-relativistic quantum mechanics&gt;.

Julian made a formal presentation that took until the afternoon and bored everyone to death, though the mathematics avoided much questioning.

Feynman then presented his revolutionary approach, which he was unable to prove basic properties of, but which gave correct results, and people were not very happy.

Does have some gems worth looking at. But generally always &lt;popular science&gt;[too superficial] as can be expected from any self-sufficient YouTubber.

The strongest are:
* early 20th century: &lt;Annalen der Physik&gt;: God &lt;OG&gt; physics journal of the early 20th century, before the &lt;Nazis&gt; fucked German science back to the &lt;Middle Ages&gt;
* 20s/30s: &lt;Nature (journal)&gt; started picking up strong
* 40s/50s: &lt;American&gt; journals started to come in strong after all the genius &lt;Jews&gt; escaped from &lt;Germany&gt;, notably &lt;Physical Review Letters&gt;
