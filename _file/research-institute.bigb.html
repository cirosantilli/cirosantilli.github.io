Original headquarters and laboratories: 463 West Street in &lt;New York&gt;, &lt;Manhattan&gt; area. On &lt;Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman&gt; Feynman mentions that in 1941 they could see the construction of the George Washington Bridge, presumably from that building, when &lt;William Shockley&gt; brought him over to visit to get a job there.

This is where they moved the &lt;Chicago Pile-1&gt; after they decided it might be a bad idea to run &lt;Chicago Pile-1&gt;[highly experimental nuclear reactions] right in the middle of one of the most populous cities of the &lt;United States&gt;.

After it was reassembled, the &lt;Chicago Pile-1&gt; was renamed as Chicago Pile 2 (CP2).

So more precisely, it is a continuation of the &lt;Metallurgical Laboratory&gt;.

It's still not that far though, only about 20 kilometers, and today is also a populated area.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; maintains that they chose the site because the name is so cool. Wikipedia says it is derived from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_of_Argonne[Forest of Argonne], maybe it even shared etymology with the element &lt;argon&gt;.

Some key experiments carried out there include:
