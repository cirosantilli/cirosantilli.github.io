This is a good company, first they truly helped reduce international transfer fees. They they continued to morph into a decent &lt;challenger bank&gt;.

Their Wise Interest account was amazing as of late 2023: https://wise.com/gb/interest/

Instant access with representative national interests and 0.29% fees.

Brick and mortar banks were way way behind in that regard!

E.g. October 2023, Wise was doing 4.87% interest after fees, while Barclay's best option was 1.16% above 5k pounds on the Rainy Day Saver (5% below). Ridiculous!

Update: On November 2023 unfortunately they more than doubled their fees from 0.19% to 0.46%:

= Investment thesis
{parent=Finance}

= Personal finance
{parent=Finance}
{wiki}

* the American stock market gives 10% / year, which is about 2x over 10 years. It has been the sure-fire best investment on a 10 year horizon for many decades, and should serve as your benchmark.
* risky diversified investments (e.g. ETFs that track a market index) are basically the best investment if you can keep your money in them in the long term (10 years)
* risky investments can gown down for a while, and you cannot take your money out then. This effectively means risk is a form of &lt;illiquidity&gt;
* investment funds have taxes, which eat into your profit. The best investments are dumb index tracking investments (like an ETF that tracks the stock market) that are simply brainless to manage, and therefore have lowest taxes. No fund has managed to beat the market long term essentially.
* when you are young, ideally you should invest everything into riskier higher yielding assets like stock. And as you get older, you should move part of it to less risky (and therefore more &lt;liquid (asset)&gt;, but lower yielding) assets like bonds

  The desire to buy a house however complicates this for many people.

{wiki}

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; once talked to a man who had been working on &lt;high-frequency trading&gt; for the last six years.

He was quite nice.

Ciro asked him in what way did he feel his job contributed to the benefit of society.

He replied that it didn't contribute at all. It was completely useless. More than that, it so completely useless, that it was even pure. A bit like advanced &lt;mathematics&gt;, but not even providing &lt;art&gt;[beauty] for anybody outside of the company, since everything is a closely guarded trade secret, unlike mathematics which is normally &lt;academic publishing&gt;[published] for the vanity recognition.

And so, &lt;Koan&gt;[Ciro was enlightened].

A great mind can work in the most useless branches of finance, without the desire to improve the world, nor make it worse. Not to compete, nor be afraid, nor anxious. A &lt;sand mandala&gt;.

Only being. Being, in the exact fraction of a moment where bid meets ask.

https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/73498/how-is-printing-money-different-from-taxing-people

To &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;, a key observation is:
&gt; The rich are more easily able to avoid the harm than poor and middle-class people \[...\] they are more likely to have large amounts of non-cash assets to shield themselves from inflation.
Clearly the rich will be much, much more shielded by keeping large parts of their wealth in shares... from this point of view, it is insane to print money!!! &lt;Tax the rich&gt; instead...

{wiki}

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; is extremely passionate about this issue, partly due to &lt;Ciro Santilli's self perceived compassionate personality&gt;.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s main approaches to reduce it:
* &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt; to make education more efficient
* &lt;free gifted education&gt;
* more granular &lt;electronic voting&gt;

One of Ciro's most direct experiences with social inequality is described at: &lt;São Remo, the favela next to USP&gt;.

We have to be careful not to make everyone poorer when trying to reduce inequality.

But as things stand as of 2020, &lt;tax the rich&gt;[increasing taxes on the very richest], and notably &lt;wealth tax&gt;, and investing it in &lt;free gifted education&gt;, seems like a safe bet to achieve any meaningful level of &lt;equal opportunity&gt; and &lt;meritocracy&gt;.
