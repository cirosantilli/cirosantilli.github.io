{wiki=Telecommunications}

Communicating at a distance, from &lt;Greek (language)&gt; "tele" for distance!

A very cool thing about &lt;telecommunication&gt; is, besides how incredibly fast it advanced (in this sense it is no cooler than &lt;integrated circuit&gt; development), how much &lt;physics&gt; and &lt;information theory&gt; is involved in it. Applications of telecommunication implementation spill over to other fields, e.g. some proposed &lt;quantum computing&gt; approaches are remarkably related to telecommunication technology, e.g. &lt;microwaves&gt; and &lt;silicon photonics&gt;.

This understanding made &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; wish he had opted for telecommunication engineering &lt;Ciro Santilli's undergrad studies at the University of São Paulo&gt;[when he was back in school in Brazil]. For some incomprehensible reason, telecommunications was the least competitive specialization in the electric engineering department at the time, behind even power electronics. This goes to show both how completely unrelated to reality university is, and how completely outdated Brazil is/was. Sad stuff.

We are at a point in history where the &lt;electrical telegraph&gt; is well established.

But people don't want to press letters one by one on a switch. They want to talk!

The first phones appear to have used telegraph lines directly.

Also wired phones don't require &lt;modulation&gt;, which likely made their development much easier than wireless voice transmission. You just send the signal as a voltage differential directly obtained from the air pressure: &lt;how the telephone works&gt;.

= How the telephone works
{parent=Telephone}

* https://www.quora.com/How-is-a-voice-transmitted-from-one-phone-to-another
* https://www.quora.com/How-many-wires-does-a-telephone-use/answer/Peter-Yardley-1
  &gt; Basic analogue phones connected to the public exchange use two wires mainly arranged as a twisted pair to reduce noise. The voice signal is differential (the voltage in one wire equal and opposite to the other) biased above ground by 48V. Using a twisted pair reduces induced noise because the noise signal will induce an equal voltage in each wire and because the signal is transmitted as the difference the effect of the induced noise will be dramatically reduced.

= Telephone-based system
{parent=Telecommunication system}
{wiki}

This section is about &lt;telecommunication systems&gt; that are based on top of telephone lines.

Telephone lines were ubiquitous from early on, and many technologies used them to send data, including much after regular phone calls became obsolete with &lt;VoIP&gt;.

These market forces tended to eventually crush non-telephone-based systems such as &lt;telex&gt;. Maybe in that case it was just that the name sounded like a thing of the 50's. But still. Dead.

Not a &lt;telephone-based system&gt;, needing its own network, and was killed particularly by &lt;fax&gt; which is. Telex evolved from the Telegraph, which is a binary system at the &lt;physical layer&gt;.

&lt;Modulation&gt; basically means encoding data on a &lt;carrier wave&gt;.

Image that we are at a point in history where &lt;spark-gap transmitters&gt; can send &lt;Morse code&gt;.

But now people want to send voice. How to do it?

It would not be practical without modulation: &lt;Why can't you send voice without modulation?&gt;

https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-an-audio-signal-to-be-fed-or-transmitted-to-the-antenna-without-modulation

Basically, the antenna has to be very, very large, more comparable to wavelength. E.g. even for the higher pitches, we fall in &lt;very low frequency&gt;, so have a look at the size of some of the &lt;submarine&gt; VLF antennas! They are like football pitch sized.

= Carrier wave
{parent=Modulation}
{wiki}

Early transmitters such as the &lt;spark-gap transmitter&gt; could only send noises to send &lt;Morse code&gt;.

To send voice and music, &lt;amplitude modulation&gt; had to be developed. And a key ingredient of this is the carrier wave.

The problem is, the carrier wave needs to have somewhat high frequencies, in the hundreds of kHz TODO why. But as you might imagine, that is hard to achieve by mechanical means such as a hand cranck like &lt;Hippolyte Pixiis alternator&gt;!

Interestingly, some of the first carrier wave generators were actually mechanical, e.g. the &lt;Alexanderson alternator&gt;.

But clearly such mechanical machines were not very scalable, and soon more &lt;electronic&gt; devices were introduced, notably the &lt;vacuum tube&gt;.

= Receiver
{synonym}

As well put by Wikipedia, a radio receiver has to perform three functions on the signal from the antenna:
* filtering, so you can tune the station you care about. This filters based on the frequency of the &lt;carrier wave&gt; you want. I.e. you use a &lt;bandpass filter&gt;.
* &lt;amplification&gt;: otherwise you won't be able to hear anything if the emitter is too far away
* &lt;demodulation&gt;: this means decoding the signal based on whatever way it was encoded, notably e.g. &lt;AM&gt;/&lt;FM&gt;

The first type of device that allowed sending &lt;Morse code&gt; without wires, as opposed to the wired &lt;electrical telegraph&gt; that previously existed.

Naval communications was one of the first major applications, as you can't have wires on boats!

Wireless voice transmission came about with &lt;modulation&gt;.
