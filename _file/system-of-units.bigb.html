{wiki}

The key thing in a good system of units is to define units in a way that depends only on physical properties of nature.

Ideally (or basically necessarily?) the starting point generally has to be discrete phenomena, e.g.
* number of times some light oscillates per second
* number of steps in a &lt;quantum Hall effect&gt; or &lt;Josephson junction&gt;

What we don't want is to have macroscopic measurement artifacts, (or even worse, the size of body parts! Inset &lt;dick&gt; joke) as you can always make a bar slightly more or less wide. And even metals evaporate over time! Though the mad people of the &lt;Avogadro project&gt; still attempted otherwise well into the 2010s!

Standards of measure that don't depend on artifacts are known as &lt;intrinsic standards&gt;.

{disambiguate=system of units}
{parent=Unit of measurement}

A dimension in a &lt;system of units&gt; is something like &lt;length&gt;, &lt;weight&gt; or &lt;time&gt;, without considering how to assign numerical values ot them, which requires &lt;units of measurement&gt; such as the &lt;meter&gt;, &lt;kilogram&gt; or &lt;second&gt;.

Talking about dimensions can be useful when explaining new derived units without worrying about the exact units involved. See e.g. this table: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lumen_(unit)&amp;oldid=1233810964#SI_photometric_units

The key is to define only the minimum number of measures: if you define more definitions become over constrained and could be inconsistent.

Learning the modern SI is also a great way to learn some interesting Physics.

https://web.archive.org/web/20181119214326/https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/CGPM-2018/26th-CGPM-Resolutions.pdf gives it in raw:
&gt; * the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the &lt;caesium-133&gt; atom $\Delta v_{Cs}$ is 9 192 631 770 Hz
  * the speed of light in vacuum c is 299 792 458 m/s
  * the &lt;Planck constant&gt; h is 6.626 070 15 × $10^{-34}$ J s
  * the elementary charge e is 1.602 176 634 × $10^{-19}$ C
  * the &lt;Boltzmann constant&gt; k is 1.380 649 × $10^{-23}$ J/K
  * the Avogadro constant NA is 6.022 140 76 × $10^{23}$ mol
  * the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 × 1012 Hz, Kcd, is 683 lm/W,
The breakdown is:
* actually use some physical constant:
  * &gt; the unperturbed ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the &lt;caesium-133&gt; atom $\Delta v_{Cs}$ is 9 192 631 770 Hz

    Defines the &lt;second&gt; in terms of &lt;caesium-133&gt; experiments. The beauty of this definition is that we only have to count an integer number of discrete events, which is what allows us to make things precise.
  * &gt; the speed of light in vacuum c is 299 792 458 m/s

    Defines the &lt;meter&gt; in terms of &lt;speed of light&gt; experiments. We already had the &lt;second&gt; from the previous definition.
  * &gt; the &lt;Planck constant&gt; h is 6.626 070 15 × $10^{-34}$ J s

    Defines the &lt;kilogram&gt; in terms of the &lt;Planck constant&gt;.
  * &gt; the elementary charge e is 1.602 176 634 × $10^{-19}$ C

    Defines the &lt;Coulomb&gt; in terms of the &lt;electron charge&gt;.
* arbitrary definitions based on the above just to match historical values as well as possible:
  * &gt; the &lt;Boltzmann constant&gt; k is 1.380 649 × $10^{-23}$ J/K

    Arbitrarily defines temperature from previously defined energy (J) to match historical values.
  * &gt; the Avogadro constant NA is 6.022 140 76 × $10^{23}$ mol

    Arbitrarily defines the mol to match historical values. In particular, the &lt;kilogram&gt; is not an exact multiple of the weight of an atom of &lt;hydrogen&gt;.
  * &gt; the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 × 1012 Hz, Kcd, is 683 lm/W

    Arbitrarily defines the Candela in terms of previous values to match historical records. The most useless unit comes last as you'd expect.

{parent=Ampere}
{tag=2019 redefinition of the SI base units}
{wiki}

Starting in the &lt;2019 redefinition of the SI base units&gt;, the &lt;elementary charge&gt; is assigned a fixed number, and the Ampere is based on it and on the &lt;second&gt;, which is beautiful.

This choice is not because we attempt to count individual &lt;electrons&gt; going through a wire, as it would be far too many to count!

Rather, it is because because there are two crazy &lt;quantum mechanical&gt; effects that give us macroscopic measures that are directly related to the electron charge. https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/ampere/ampere-quantum-metrology-triangle[] by the &lt;NIST&gt; explains that the two effects are:
* &lt;quantum Hall effect&gt;, which has &lt;discrete&gt; &lt;electrical resistance&gt;[resistances] of type:
  $$
  R_{xy} = \frac{V_\text{Hall}}{I_\text{channel}} = \frac{h}{e^2\nu}
  $$
  for integer values of $\nu$.
* &lt;Josephson effect&gt;, used in the &lt;Josephson voltage standard&gt;. With the &lt;Inverse AC Josephson effect&gt; we are able to produce:
  $$
  K_{J} = \frac{2e}{h} V \cdot s
  $$
  per &lt;Josephson junction&gt;. This is about 2 microvolt / GHz, where GHz is a practical input frequency. &lt;video The evolution of voltage metrology to the latest generation of JVSs by Alain Rüfenacht&gt; mentions that a typical operating frequency is 20 GHz.

  Therefore to attain a good 10 V, we need something in the order of a million &lt;Josephson junctions&gt;.

  But this is possible to implement in a single chip with existing micro fabrication techniques, and is exactly what the &lt;Josephson voltage standard&gt; does!

Those effect work because they also involve dividing by the &lt;Planck constant&gt;, the fundamental constant of &lt;quantum mechanics&gt;, which is also tiny, and thus brings values into a much more measurable order of size.

The &lt;Kibble balance&gt; is so precise and reproducible that it was responsible for the &lt;2019 redefinition of the Kilogram&gt;.

{title=NIST-4 Kibble balance}

It relies rely on not one, but three macroscopic &lt;quantum mechanical&gt; effects:
* &lt;atomic spectra&gt;: basis for the &lt;caesium standard&gt; which produces precise time and frequency
* &lt;Josephson effect&gt;: basis for the &lt;Josephson voltage standard&gt;, which produces precise &lt;voltage&gt;
* &lt;quantum Hall effect&gt;: basis for the &lt;quantum Hall effect&gt;, which produces precise &lt;electrical resistance&gt;
How cool is that! As usual, the advantage of those effects is that they are discrete, and have very fixed values that don't depend either:
* on the physical dimensions of any apparatus (otherwise fabrication precision would be an issue)
* small variations of temperature, magnetic field and so on
One downside of using some &lt;quantum mechanical&gt; effects is that you have to cool everything down to 5K. But that's OK, we've got &lt;liquid helium&gt;!

The operating principle is something along:
* generate a precise frequency with a &lt;signal generator&gt;, ultimately calibrated by the &lt;Caesium standard&gt;
* use that precise frequency to generate a precise &lt;voltage&gt; with a &lt;Josephson voltage standard&gt;
* convert that precise voltage into a precise &lt;electric current&gt; by using the &lt;quantum Hall effect&gt;, which produces a very precise &lt;electrical resistance&gt;
* use that precise current to generate a precise force on the object your weighing, pushing it against &lt;gravity&gt;
* then you precisely measure both:
  * local &lt;gravity&gt; with a &lt;gravimeter&gt;
  * the displacement acceleration of the object with a laser setup
Then, based on all this, you can determine how much the object weights.

Like a &lt;quartz clock&gt;, it also relies on the &lt;piezoelectricity&gt; of quartz, but unlike the &lt;quartz clock&gt;, the &lt;quartz&gt; is not shaped like a &lt;tuning fork&gt;, and has a much larger resonating frequency of about 7 &lt;MHz&gt;.
