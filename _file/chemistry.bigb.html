Chemistry is fun. Too hard for precise &lt;physics&gt; (pre &lt;quantum computing&gt;, see also &lt;quantum chemistry&gt;), but not too hard for some maths like &lt;social sciences&gt;.

And it underpins &lt;biology&gt;.

= Atomic theory
{synonym}

Theory that atoms exist, i.e. matter is not continuous.

Much before atoms were thought to be "experimentally real", chemists from the 19th century already used "conceptual atoms" as units for the proportions observed in macroscopic chemical reactions, e.g. $2 H_2 + O_2 \leftrightarrow H_{2}O$. The thing is, there was still the possibility that those proportions were made up of something continuous that for some reason could only combine in the given proportions, so the atoms could only be strictly consider calculatory devices pending further evidence.

&lt;Subtle is the Lord by Abraham Pais (1982)&gt; chapter 5 "The reality of molecules" has some good mentions. Notably, physicists generally came to believe in atoms earlier than chemists, because the phenomena they were most interested in, e.g. pressure in the &lt;ideal gas law&gt;, and then &lt;Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics&gt; just scream atoms more loudly than chemical reactions, as they saw that these phenomena could be explained to some degree by traditional mechanics of little balls.

Confusion around the probabilistic nature of the &lt;second law of thermodynamics&gt; was also used as a physical counterargument by some. Pais mentions that &lt;Wilhelm Ostwald&gt; notably argued that the &lt;time reversibility of classical mechanics&gt; + the second law being a fundamental law of physics (and not just probabilistic, which is the correct hypothesis as we now understand) must imply that atoms are not classic billiard balls, otherwise the second law could be broken.

Pais also mentions that a big "chemical" breakthrough was &lt;isomers suggest that atoms exist&gt;.

Very direct evidence evidence:
* &lt;Brownian motion&gt; mathematical analysis in 1908. Brownian motion just makes it too clear that liquids cannot be continuous... if they were, there would obviously be no &lt;Brownian motion&gt;, full stop.
* &lt;X-ray crystallography&gt;: it \i[sees] crystal latices
* &lt;scanning tunnelling microscope&gt;: it \i[sees] individual atoms for Christ's sake, what else do you want?

  {source=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_Boy_and_His_Atom_(still).jpg}

Less direct evidence:
* 1874 &lt;Isomers suggest that atoms exist&gt;
* &lt;kinetic theory of gases&gt; seems to explain certain phenomena really well

&lt;Subtle is the Lord by Abraham Pais (1982)&gt; page 40 mentions several methods that &lt;Einstein&gt; used to "prove" that atoms were real. Perhaps the greatest argument of all is that several unrelated methods give the same estimates of atom size/mass:
* from 1905:
  * in light quantum paper
  * enabled by experimental work of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Pfeffer[Wilhelm Pfeffer] on producing rigid membranes
    * sugar molecules in water
    * &lt;Brownian motion&gt;: &lt;investigations on the theory of the Brownian movement by Einstein (1905)&gt;
* 1911: blueness of the sky and critical opalescence

{title2=1874}
{wiki}

&lt;Subtle is the Lord by Abraham Pais (1982)&gt; page 85:
&gt; However, it became increasingly difficult in chemical circles to deny the reality of molecules after 1874, the year in which Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel independently explained the &lt;isomerism&gt; of certain organic substances in terms of &lt;stereochemical&gt; properties of carbon compounds.
so it is quite cool to see that &lt;organic chemistry&gt; is one of the things that pushed atomic theory forward. Because when you start to observe that &lt;isomers&gt; has different characteristics, despite identical proportions of atoms, this is really hard to explain without talking about the relative positions of the atoms within molecules!

TODO: is there anything even more precise that points to atoms in stereoisomers besides just the "two isomers with different properties" thing?

= Brownian motion
{c}
{parent=Atomic theory evidence}
{title2=1785 or 1827}
{wiki}

Small microscopic visible particles move randomly around in water.

If water were continuous, this shouldn't happen. Therefore this serves as one important evidence of &lt;atomic theory&gt;.

The amount it moves also quantitatively matches with the expected properties of water and the floating particles, was was settled in 1905 by &lt;Einstein&gt; at: &lt;investigations on the theory of the Brownian movement by Einstein (1905)&gt;.

This suggestion that Brownian motion comes from the movement of atoms had been made much before Einstein however, and passed tortuous discussions. &lt;Subtle is the Lord by Abraham Pais (1982)&gt; page 93 explains it well. There had already been infinite discussion on possible causes of those movements besides &lt;atomic theory&gt;, and many ideas were rejected as incompatible with observations:
&gt; Further investigations eliminated such causes as temperature gradients, mechanical disturbances, capillary actions, irradiation of the liquid (as long as the resulting temperature increase can be neglected), and the presence of convection currents within the liquid.
The first suggestions of atomic theory were from the 1860s.

Tiny uniform plastic beads called "microbeads" are the preferred 2019 modern method of doing this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbead

Original well known observation in 1827 by Brown, with further experiments and interpretation in 1908 by &lt;Jean Baptiste Perrin&gt;. Possible precursor observation in 1785 by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Ingenhousz[Jan Ingenhousz], not sure why he wasn't credited better.

Was the first model to explain the &lt;Balmer series&gt;, notably linking atomic spectra to the &lt;Planck constant&gt; and therefore to other initial &lt;quantum mechanical&gt; observations.

This was one of the first major models that just said:
&gt; I give up, I can't tie this to &lt;classical physics&gt; in any way, let's just roll with it, OK?

It still treats &lt;electrons&gt; as little points spinning around the nucleus, but it makes the non-&lt;classical physics&gt;[classical] postulate that only certain angular momentums (and therefore energies) are allowed.

This technique is crazy! It allows to both:
* separate gaseous mixtures
* identify gaseous compounds
You actually see discrete peaks at different minute counts on the other end.

It is based on how much the gas interacts with the column.

Detection is usually done burning the sample to ionize it when it comes out, and then you measure the current produced.

The procedure remind you a bit of &lt;gel electrophoresis&gt;, except that it is in gaseous phase.

{parent=Analytical chemistry method}
{title2}
{wiki}

An &lt;ion selective electrode&gt; is tool used in  &lt;analytical chemistry&gt; used to determine the concentration of a given &lt;ion&gt; in a solution.

The method can determine the concentration of one ion even if there are multiple different types of &lt;ion&gt; in the solution, although in some cases this can alter the results. This is done with the help of a selective membrane that only allows certain ions through.

One cool example application mentioned on &lt;LibreTexts&gt;https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Physical_Methods_in_Chemistry_and_Nano_Science_(Barron)/01%3A_Elemental_Analysis/1.07%3A_Ion_Selective_Electrode_Analysis{ref} is the measurement of &lt;fluorine&gt; concentration in water. They explain that &lt;fluorine&gt; is added to the drinking water supply in some countries to help protect people's teeth, and so you want to be able to measure as part of quality control to make sure it is being added in correct the quantities.

The method requires calibrating with calibrating solutions which takes one hour, but once you are calibrated you just stick the sensor into the &lt;analyte&gt; and get readings in a minute without any expendables. The membrane seems to be a bit fragile which requires care, but overall it looks like a convenient method.

&lt;The Supermen: The Story of Seymour Cray by Charles J. Murray (1997)&gt; page 4 mentions:
&gt; Cray wanted his new machine to employ circuits made from a material called gallium arsenide. Gallium arsenide had achieved limited success, particularly in satellite communications and military electronics. But no one had succeeded with it in anything so complicated as a computer. In the computer industry, engineers had developed a saying: "Gallium arsenide is the technology of the future," they would say. "And it always will be."

The &lt;fucked&gt; thing about this byproduct is that it is in the same chemical family as &lt;sodium&gt;, and therefore forms a salt that looks like regular &lt;sodium chloride&gt;[table salt], and dissolves in water and therefore easily enters your body and sticks to things.

Another problem is that its &lt;half-life&gt; is long enough that it doesn't lose radioactivity very quickly compared to the life of a human person, although it is short enough to make it highly toxic, making it a terrible pollutant when released.

This is why for example in the &lt;goiânia accident&gt; a girl ended up ingesting Caesium-137 after eating an egg after touching the Caesium with her hands.

{parent=Uranium vs Plutonium}

Because you can generate &lt;plutonium-239&gt; from &lt;uranium-238&gt; in a &lt;breeder reactor&gt;, and then separate the &lt;plutonium-239&gt; from the &lt;Uranium&gt; simply by using &lt;chemistry&gt; methods because you've created an element with different valence electrons.

Isn't it somewhat funny that it is easier to purify a synthetic element than a naturally occurring one?

This is an important man-made &lt;uranium compound&gt; as it is used in &lt;uranium enrichment&gt;.

The main reason for this is that &lt;fluorine&gt; only has one stable &lt;isotope&gt;, which allows you to pick up weight differences in &lt;uranium isotopes&gt; in isolation.

&lt;Glass&gt; with &lt;Uranium&gt; added to it to become &lt;fluorescent&gt; due to &lt;Uranium&gt;'s chemical properties. This is unrelated to &lt;Uranium&gt;'s nuclear properties.

However it was this &lt;fluorescence&gt; that led &lt;Henri Becquerel&gt; to discover &lt;radioactivity&gt; while studying &lt;fluorescence&gt;, which led him to have &lt;Uranium&gt; compounds and &lt;photographic&gt; material in close proximity. I love science I guess.

This &lt;isotope&gt; shows up as an inevitable contaminant in &lt;Plutonium-239&gt; for &lt;nuclear weapons&gt;, because it emits &lt;neutrons&gt; too fast and makes it harder to assemble the critical mass without &lt;fizzle (nuclear explosion)&gt;.

It is the presence of this contaminant that made &lt;implosion-type fission weapon&gt; a necessity: &lt;Gun-type fission weapons don't work with plutonium&gt;{full}.

&lt;Wikipedia&gt; explains that Pu-240 is formed by Pu-239 &lt;Neutron&gt; capture:
&gt; About 62% to 73% of the time when \sup[239]Pu captures a neutron, it undergoes fission; the remainder of the time, it forms 240Pu.
so its presence is inevitable.

Ah, this seems like a nice dude.

&lt;The Eighth Day of Creation&gt; has two nice paragraphs about his work. He was shy and quiet, and didn't boast about his slow and steady progress, possibly because of this he only had a junior fellowship and at some point some people wanted to kick him out of the lab somewhere between 1948 - 1952, quoted at: https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2013/11/fred-sanger-1918-2013.html

This is where he started publishing the sequence of &lt;insulin&gt;. The paper gives the full &lt;B-chain of insulin&gt;[B-chain] sequence, which it tentatively calls the "&lt;Phenylalanyl&gt; Chain" because it starts with a &lt;Phenylalanyl&gt;.

The official link seems to be: https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article/49/4/463/47212/The-amino-acid-sequence-in-the-phenylalanyl-chain It seems to explain the methods very well at first glance, with lots of schematics.

|| Battery Shape
|| Chemistry
|| Nominal Voltage
|| Rechargeable?

| AA, AAA, C, D (Rechargeable)
| NiMH or NiCd

Discovering them was not so easy because they don't form &lt;chemical compounds&gt;. So they exist only as gases. And &lt;Helium&gt; disperses off into space.

&lt;Argon&gt; was the first to be found by density considerations because it is so abundant on &lt;Earth's atmosphere&gt; (~1%): &lt;Argon is abundant on Earth's atmosphere because it comes from the decay of Potassium-40&gt;.

Then basically all of the others were discovered by &lt;spectral lines&gt;. &lt;Helium&gt; notably was first found on the &lt;Sun&gt; like that, and only later on Earth! Thus its name. Pretty cool.

Very good documentary! Explains things very well! Great acting and wardrobe too.

Particularly tasteful is their choice of native speaker actors who speak their native language for less important narration, and English with an accent for more important moments, in particular when talking solo to the camera.
