A branch of &lt;mathematics&gt; that attempts to prove stuff about &lt;computers&gt;.

Unfortunately, all &lt;software engineers&gt; already know the answer to the useful theorems though (except perhaps notably for &lt;cryptography&gt;), e.g. all programmers obviously know that iehter &lt;p versus NP problem&gt;[P != NP] or that this is &lt;independence (mathematical logic)&gt;[unprovable or some other "for all practical purposes practice P != NP"], even though they don't have proof.

And 99% of their time, software engineers are not dealing with mathematically formulatable problems anyways, which is sad.

The only useful "computer science" subset every programmer ever needs to know is:
* for arrays: &lt;dynamic array&gt; vs &lt;linked list&gt;
* for &lt;associative array&gt;: &lt;binary search tree&gt; vs &lt;hash table&gt;. See also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6147242/heap-vs-binary-search-tree-bst/29548834#29548834[Heap vs Binary Search Tree (BST)]. No need to understand the algorithmic details of the hash function, the &lt;NSA&gt; has already done that for you.
* don't use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort[Bubble sort] for sorting
* you can't parse HTML with regular expressions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454[] because of &lt;formal language theory&gt;

Funnily, due to the &lt;formalization of mathematics&gt;, &lt;mathematics&gt; can be seen as a branch of computer science, just like computer science can be seen as a branch of Mathematics!

{c}
{parent=Computer science}
{wiki}

The dominating model of a computer.

The model is extremely simple, but has been proven to be able to solve all the problems that any reasonable computer model can solve, thus its adoption as the "default model".

The smallest known Turing machine that cannot be proven to halt or not as of 2019 is 7,918-states: https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2725[]. https://www.scottaaronson.com/[Shtetl-Optimized] by Scott Aaronson is just the best website.

A bunch of non-reasonable-looking computers have also been proven to be Turing complete for fun, e.g. &lt;Magic: The Gathering&gt;.

= Universal Turing machine
{c}

{synonym}

Is a &lt;decision problem&gt; of determining if something belongs to a non-&lt;recursive language&gt;.

Or in other words: there is no &lt;Turing machine&gt; that always halts for every input with the yes/no output.

Every undecidable problem must obviously have an infinite number of "possibilities of stuff you can try": if there is only a finite number, then you can brute-force it.

Some undecidable problems are of &lt;recursively enumerable language&gt;, e.g. the &lt;halting problem&gt;.

= Undecidability requires infinitely many inputs
{parent=Undecidable problem}

If there are infinitely many inputs, we can always construct a (potentially exponentially huge) &lt;Turing machine&gt; that hardcodes the outcome for every possible input, so the problem is never &lt;undecidable&gt;.

The problem is of course deciding and proving the outcome for each possible input, notably as it is possible that calculation for some of the inputs may be &lt;independent (mathematical logic)&gt; from &lt;ZFC&gt;.

= Mortal matrix problem
{parent=Undecidable problem}

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_matrix#Occurrences

One of the most simple to state &lt;undecidable problems&gt;.

The reason that it is undecidable is that you can repeat each matrix any number of times, so there isn't a finite number of possibilities to check.

= Turing machine decider
{c}
{parent=Halting problem}

A &lt;Turing machine&gt; decider is a program that decides if one or more &lt;Turing machines&gt; halts of not.

Of course, because what we know about the &lt;halting problem&gt;, there cannot exist a single decider that decides all &lt;Turing machines&gt;.

E.g. &lt;The Busy Beaver Challenge&gt; has a set of deciders clearly published, which decide a large part of &lt;BB(5)&gt;. Their proposed deciders are listed at: https://discuss.bbchallenge.org/c/deciders/5[] and actually applied ones at: https://bbchallenge.org[].

But there are deciders that can decide large classes of turing machines.

Many (all/most?) deciders are based on simulation of machines with arbitrary cutoff &lt;hyperparameters&gt;, e.g. the cutoff space/time of a &lt;Turing machine cycler decider&gt;.

The simplest and most obvious example is the &lt;Turing machine cycler decider&gt;

= Turing machine regex tape notation
{c}
{parent=Turing machine decider}

&lt;Turing machine regex tape notation&gt; is &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s made up name for the notation used e.g. at:
* https://www.sligocki.com/2023/02/02/skelet-34.html
* https://www.sligocki.com/2022/06/10/ctl.html
Most of it is just regular &lt;regular expression&gt; notation, with a few differences:
* $0^{\inf}$ denotes the right or left edge of the (zero initialized) tape. It is often omitted as we always just assume it is always present on both sides of every regex
* `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `E` denotes the current machine state. This is especially common notation in the context of the &lt;BB(5)&gt; problem
* `&lt;` and `&gt;` next to the state indicate if the head is on top of the left or right element. E.g.:
  ``
  11 (01)^n &lt;A 00 (0011)^{n+2}
  ``
  indicates that the head `A` is on top of the last `1` of the last sequence of n `01`s to the left of the head.

This notation is very useful, as it helps compress long repeated sequences of &lt;Turing machine&gt; tape and extract higher level patterns from them, which is how you go about understanding a Turing machine in order to apply &lt;Turing machine acceleration&gt;.

Example: https://bbchallenge.org/279081[].

These are very simple, they just check for exact state repetitions, which obviously imply that they will run forever.

Unfortunately, cyclers may need to run through an initial setup phase before reaching the initial cycle point, which is not very elegant.

Also, we have no way of knowing the initial setup length of the actual cycle length, so we just need an arbitrary cutoff value.

And unfortunately, this can lead to misses, e.g. &lt;Skelet machine #1&gt;, a 5 state machine, has a (translated) cycle that starts at around 50-200M steps, and takes 8 trillion steps to repeat.

Like a cycler, but the cycle starts at an offset.

To see infinity, we check that if the machine only goes left N squares until reaching the repetition, then repetition must only be N squares long.

= Busy beaver game
{synonym}

The busy beaver game consists in finding, for a given $n$, the turing machine with $n$ states that writes the largest possible number of 1's on a tape initially filled with 0's. In other words, computing the &lt;busy beaver function&gt; for a given $n$.

There are only finitely many Turing machines with $n$ states, so we are certain that there exists such a maximum. Computing the &lt;Busy beaver function&gt; for a given $n$ then comes down to solving the halting problem for every single machine with $n$ states.

Some variant definitions define it as the number of time steps taken by the machine instead. Wikipedia talks about their relationship, but no patience right now.

The Busy Beaver problem is cool because it puts the &lt;halting problem&gt; in a more precise numerical light, e.g.:
* the &lt;Busy beaver function&gt; is the most obvious &lt;uncomputable function&gt; one can come up with starting from the &lt;halting problem&gt;
* the &lt;Busy beaver scale&gt; allows us to gauge the difficulty of proving certain (yet unproven!) mathematical &lt;conjectures&gt;

= Step busy beaver

The &lt;step busy beaver&gt; is a variant of the &lt;busy beaver game&gt; counts the number of steps before halt, instead of the number of 1's written to the tape.

As of 2023, it appears that &lt;BB(5)&gt; the same machine, , will win both for 5 states. But this is not always necessarily the case.

&lt;Turing machine acceleration&gt; refers to using high level understanding of specific properties of specific Turing machines to be able to simulate them much fatser than naively running the simulation as usual.

Acceleration allows one to use simulation to find infinite loops that might be very long, and would not be otherwise spotted without acceleration.

= Busy beaver scale
{parent=Busy beaver}

The &lt;Busy beaver scale&gt; allows us to gauge the difficulty of proving certain (yet unproven!) mathematical &lt;conjectures&gt;!

To to this, people have reduced certain mathematical problems to deciding the &lt;halting problem&gt; of a specific &lt;Turing machine&gt;.

A good example is perhaps the &lt;Goldbach's conjecture&gt;. We just make a &lt;Turing machine&gt; that successively checks for each even number of it is a sum of two primes by naively looping down and trying every possible pair. Let the machine halt if the check fails. So this machine halts &lt;iff&gt; the &lt;Goldbach's conjecture&gt; is false! See also &lt;Conjecture reduction to a halting problem&gt;.

Therefore, if we were able to compute $BB(n)$, we would be able to prove those conjectures automatically, by letting the machine run up to $BB(n)$, and if it hadn't halted by then, we would know that it would never halt.

Of course, in practice, $BB$ is generally &lt;uncomputable&gt;, so we will never know it. And furthermore, even if it were computable, it would take a lot longer than the age of the universe to compute any of it, so it would be useless.

However, philosophically speaking at least, the number of states of the equivalent &lt;Turing machine&gt; gives us a philosophical idea of the complexity of the problem.

The &lt;busy beaver scale&gt; is likely mostly useless, since we are able to prove that many non-trivial &lt;Turing machines&gt; do halt, often by reducing problems to simpler known cases. But still, it is cute.

But maybe, just maybe, reduction to Turing machine form could be useful. E.g. &lt;The Busy Beaver Challenge&gt; and other attempts to solve &lt;BB(5)&gt; have come up with large number of automated (usually parametrized up to a certain threshold) &lt;Turing machine decider&gt; programs that automatically determine if certain (often large numbers of) Turing machines run forever.

So it it not impossible that after some reduction to a standard &lt;Turing machine&gt; form, some conjecture just gets automatically brute-forced by one of the deciders, this is a path to

{parent=Busy beaver scale}
{tag=Automated theorem proving}

If you can reduce a mathematical problem to the &lt;Halting problem&gt; of a specific turing machine, as in the case of a few machines of the &lt;Busy beaver scale&gt;, then using &lt;Turing machine deciders&gt; could serve as a method of &lt;automated theorem proving&gt;.

That feels like it could be an elegant proof method, as you reduce your problem to one of the most well studied representations that exists: a &lt;Turing machine&gt;.

However it also appears that certain problems cannot be reduced to a &lt;halting problem&gt;... OMG life sucks (or is awesome?): &lt;Turing machine that halts if and only if Collatz conjecture is false&gt;{full}.

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/309044/is-there-a-known-turing-machine-which-halts-if-and-only-if-the-collatz-conjectur suggests one does not exist. Amazing.

Intuitively we see that the situation is fundamentally different from the &lt;Turing machine that halts if and only if the Goldbach conjecture is false&gt; because for Collatz the counter example must go off into infinity, while in Goldbach conjecture we can finitely check any failures.

Amazing.

This is a family of notations related to the &lt;big O notation&gt;. A good mnemonic summary of all notations would be:

* &lt;little-o notation&gt;: $|f| \lt g$

{parent=Big O notation family}
{title2=$O(n)$}
{wiki}

Module bound above, possibly multiplied by a constant:
$$
f(x) = O(g(x))
$$
is defined as:
$$
\exists M &gt; 0 \exists x_0  \forall x &gt; x_0 \colon |f(x)| \leq M g(x)
$$

E.g.:
* $\forall c \in \R x + c = O(x)$. For $c &lt; 0$, $M = 1$ is enough. Otherwise, any $M &gt; 1$ will do, the bottom line will always catch up to the top one eventually.

= Little-o notation
{parent=Big O notation family}

Stronger version of the &lt;big O notation&gt;, basically means that ratio goes to zero. In &lt;big O notation&gt;, the ratio does not need to go to zero.

So in informal terms, &lt;big O notation&gt; means $\leq$, and &lt;little-o notation&gt; means $&lt;$.

E.g.:
* $x = O(x)$
* $x \ne o(x)$K does not tend to zero
* $x = O(x^2)$
* $x = o(x^2)$

= Primitive recursive function
{parent=Complexity class}
{wiki}

= Primitive recursive
{synonym}

In intuitive terms it consists of all integer functions, possibly with multiple input arguments, that can be written only with a sequence of:
* variable assignments
* addition and subtraction
* integer comparisons and if/else
* &lt;for loops&gt;
``
for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
``
and such that `n` does not change inside the loop body, i.e. no &lt;while loops&gt; with arbitrary conditions.

`n` does not have to be a constant, it may come from previous calculations. But it must not change inside the loop body.

&lt;Primitive recursive functions&gt; basically include every integer function that comes up in practice. Primitive recursive functions can have huge complexity, and it strictly contains &lt;EXPTIME&gt;. As such, they mostly only come up in &lt;foundation of mathematics&gt; contexts.

The cool thing about &lt;primitive recursive functions&gt; is that the number of iterations is always bound, so we are certain that they terminate and are therefore &lt;computable&gt;.

This also means that there are necessarily functions which are not &lt;primitive recursive&gt;, as we know that there must exist &lt;uncomputable&gt; functions, e.g. the &lt;busy beaver function&gt;.

Adding unbounded &lt;while loops&gt; of course enables us to simulate arbitrary &lt;Turing machines&gt;, and therefore increases the &lt;complexity class&gt;.

More finely, there are &lt;non-primitive total recursive functions&gt;, e.g. most famously the &lt;Ackermann function&gt;.
