= Ciro's ASCII art circuit diagram notation
{c}
{parent=ASCII art circuit diagram}

This notation is designed to be relatively easy to write. This is achieved by not drawing ultra complex ASCII art boxes of every component. It would be slightly more readable if we did that, but prioritizing the writer here.

Two wires are only joined if `+` is given. E.g. the following two wires are not joined:
``
  |
--|--
  |
``
but the following are:
``
  |
--+--
  |
``

Simple symmetric components:
* `-`, `+` and `|`: wire
* `AC`: &lt;AC source&gt;. Parameters:
  * `Hz`: frequency
  * `V`: peak voltage
  e.g.:
  ``
  AC_1Hz_2V
  ``
  If only one side is given, the other is assumed to be at a ground `G`.
* `C`: &lt;capacitor&gt;
* `G`: ground. Often used together with `DC`, e.g.:
  ``
  DC_10---R_10---G
  ``
  means applying a voltage of 10 V across a 10 Ohm &lt;resistor&gt;, which would lead to a current of 1 A
* `L`: &lt;inductor&gt;
* `MICROPHONE`. As a multi-letter symmetric component, you can connect the two wires anywhere, e.g.
  ``
  ---MICROPHONE---
  ``
  or:
  ``
  |
  MICROPHONE
      |
  ``
* `SPEAKER`
* `R`: &lt;resistor&gt;
* `SQUID`: &lt;SQUID device&gt;
* `X`: &lt;Josephson junction&gt;

Asymmetric components have multiple letters indicating different ports. The capital letter indicates the device, and lower case letters the ports. The wires then go into the ports:
* `D`: &lt;diode&gt;
  * `a`: anode (where electrons can come in from)
  * `c`: cathode
  Sample usage in a circuit:
  ``
  --aDc--
  ``
  Can also be used vertically like aany other circuit:
  ``
  |
  a
  D
  c
  |
  ``
  We can also change the port order, the device is still the same due to capital `D`:
  ``
  --cDa--

   |
  Dac--

   |
  Dca--

     |
  --caD
  ``
* `DC` &lt;DC source&gt;. Ports:
  * `p`: positive
  * `n`: negative
  E.g. a 10 V source with a 10 Ohm resistor would be:
  ``
  +---pDC_10_n---+
  |              |
  +----R_10------+
  ``
  If only one side is given, the other is assumed to be at a the ground `G`. We can also omit `p` and `m` in that case and assume that `p` is the one used, e.g. the above would be equivalent to:
  ``
  DC_10---R_10---G
  ``
  If the voltage is not given, it is assumed to be a variable voltage power supply.
* `LED`: same as diode
* `I`: &lt;electric current&gt; source. Ports:
  * `s`: electron source
  * `d`: electron destination
* `P`: &lt;potentiometer&gt; source. Ports:
  * `1`: one of the sides
  * `2`: the middle
  * `3`: the other side
* `T`: &lt;transistor&gt;. The ports are `sgTd`:
  * `s`: source
  * `g`: gate
  * `d`: gate
  Sample usage in a circuit:
  ``
  ---+
     |
  --sgTd--
  ``
  All the following are also equivalent:
  ``
     |
     g
  --sTd--

      |
  --Tsgd--
     |
  ``
* `V`: &lt;Voltmeter&gt;. Ports:
  * `p`: positive
  * `n`: negative
  If we don't need to specify explicit positive and negative sides, we can just use:
  ``
  ---V---
  ``
  without any ports. This is notably often the case for AC circuits.

  Optionally, we can also add the sides as in:
* ports can also be separated by double underscores from the component names to increase readability. Single underscores can also be used to increase readability of longer multi-word component names e.g.:
  ``
  RPI_PICO_W__1gp0__3gnd
              |       |
              R_2k    |
              |       |
              +-aLEDc-+
  ``
  which is the same as:
  ``
  RPI_PICO_W
  1gp0  3gnd
  |       |
  R_2k    |
  |       |
  +-aLEDc-+
  ``
  represents a circuit linking port 1 of a &lt;Raspberry Pi Pico W&gt;, which is GPIO pin 0, through a &lt;resistor&gt; and an &lt;LED&gt;, back to pin 3 of the board, which is ground.

Numbers characterizing components are put just next to each component with an underscore. When there is only one parameter, standard units are assumed, e.g.:
``
+-----+
|     |
C_1p  R_2k
|     |
+-----+
``
means:
* a capacitor with 1 pico Faraday
* a resistor with 2 k Ohms
Micro is denoted as `u`.

Wires can just freely come in and out of specs of a component, they are then just connected to the component, e.g.:
``
DC_10---R_10---G
``
means applying a voltage of 10 V across a 10 Ohm &lt;resistor&gt;, which would lead to a current of 1 A

If a component has more than two parameters, units are used to distinguish them when possible, e.g.:
``
AC_1kV_2MHz
``
means an &lt;AC source&gt; with:
* 1 kV &lt;voltage&gt;
* 1 MHz frequency

= Capacitor
{parent=Electronic component}
{wiki}

The fundamental intuition about capacitors is that they never let &lt;electrons&gt; through.

They can only absorb &lt;electrons&gt; up to a certain point, but then the pushback becomes too strong, and current stops.

Therefore, they cannot conduct &lt;direct current&gt; long term.

For &lt;alternating current&gt; however, things are different, because in alternating current, &lt;electrons&gt; are just jiggling back and forward a little bit around a center point. So you can send alternating current power across a capacitor.

The key equation that relates &lt;Voltage&gt; to &lt;electric current&gt; in the &lt;capacitor&gt; is:
$$
I(t) = C \dv{V(t)}{t}
$$
So if a voltage &lt;Heavyside step function&gt; is applied what happens is:
* the capacitor fills up instantly with an infinite current
* the current then stops instantly
More realistically, one may consider the behavior or the &lt;series RC circuit&gt; to see what happens without infinities when a capacitor is involved as in the &lt;step response of the series RC circuit&gt;.

Ideally can be thought of as a one-way ticket gate that only lets electrons go in one direction with zero resistance! Real devices do have imperfections however, so there is some resistance.

First they were made out of &lt;vacuum tubes&gt;, but later &lt;semiconductor diodes&gt; were invented and became much more widespread.

= Crystal detector
{parent=Semiconductor diode}
{wiki}

The first &lt;diodes&gt;. These were apparently incredibly unreliable, especially for portable radios, as you had to randomly search for the best contact point you could find in a random polycrystalline material!!

And also quality was highly dependant on where the material was sourced from as that affected the impurities present in the material. Later this was understood to be an issue of &lt;doping (semiconductor)&gt;.

It was so unreliable that &lt;vacuum tube&gt; diodes overtook them in many applications, even though &lt;crystal detectors&gt; are actually &lt;semiconductor diodes&gt;, which eventually won over!

For a long time, before artificial &lt;semiconductors&gt; kicked in, people just didn't know the underlying physical working principle of these detectors. &lt;What I cannot create, I do not understand&gt; basically.

= Crystal radio
{parent=Crystal detector}
{tag=Radio receiver}

This was the first generation of commercially successful radios.

It uses a &lt;crystal detector&gt; as its &lt;diode&gt;, which is a crucial element of the radio, thus its name.

They were superseded by &lt;#transistor radios&gt;, which were much more reliable, portable and could amplify the signal received.

{parent=General-purpose input output}

GPIO generally only supports discrete outputs.

But for some types of hardware, like LEDs and some motors, the system has some inertia, and if you switch on and off fast enough, you get a result similar to having an intermediate voltage.

So with pulse width modulation we can fake &lt;analog&gt; output from digital output in a good enough manner.

Microbit simulator using some &lt;Microsoft&gt; framework.

TODO the Python code from there does not seem to run on the microbit via `uflash`, because it is not &lt;MicroPython&gt;.

https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000111744-makecode-python-and-micropython explains.

https://forum.makecode.com/t/help-understanding-local-build-options/6130 asks how to compile locally and suggests it is possible. Seems to require &lt;Yotta (build system)&gt;, so presumably compiles?

Presumably this is because Microsoft ported their MakeCode thing to the MicroBit, and the Micro Bit foundation accepted them.

E.g. there toggling a LED:
``
led.toggle(0, 0)
``
but the code that works locally is a completely differently named API `set_pixel`:
``
microbit.display.set_pixel(0, 0, )
``
Microsoft going all in on adopt extend extinguish from an early age!

= Micro Bit getting started
{parent=Micro Bit}

When plugged into &lt;Ubuntu 22.04&gt; via the &lt;USB Micro-B&gt; the &lt;Micro Bit&gt; mounts as:
``
/media/$USER/MICROBIT/
``
e.g.:
``
/media/ciro/MICROBIT/
``
for username `ciro`.

Loading the program is done by simply copying a `.hex` binary into the image e.g. with:
``
cp ~/Downloads/microbit_program.hex /media/$USER/MICROBIT/
``
The file name does not matter, only the `.hex` extension.

The back power light flashes while upload is happening.

Flashing takes about 10-15 seconds for the 1.8 MB scroll display hello world from https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/v1.0.1/tutorials/hello.html[]:
``
from microbit import *
display.scroll("Hello, World!")
``
and the program starts executing immediately after flash ends.

You can restart the program by clicking the reset button near the USB. When you push down the program dies, and it restarts as soon as you release the button.

The build also generates a .hex file by default, and we've tried to flash it manually with:
``
cp build/microbit/hello_world/zephyr/zephyr.hex /media/ciro/MICROBIT/
``
but we failed to see it do anything with &lt;zephyr/blink_gpio.c&gt;{file}, so not sure if the flashing was broken or if the code was broken, or if we didn't find the IO pins correctly.

Official support is abysmal, very focused on &lt;MicroPython&gt; and their graphical UI.

The setup impossible to achieve as it requires setting up the &lt;Yotta (build system)&gt;, just like the impossible to setup &lt;Compile MicroPython code for Micro Bit locally on Ubuntu 22.04 with your own firmware&gt; setup.

So we just use https://github.com/lancaster-university/microbit-samples + https://github.com/carlosperate/docker-microbit-toolchain[]:
``
docker pull ghcr.io/carlosperate/microbit-toolchain:latest
git clone https://github.com/lancaster-university/microbit-samples
cd microbit-samples

``
.hex file size for the hello world was 447 kB, much better than the &lt;MicroPython&gt; hello world downloaded from the website which was about 1.8 MB!

If you try it again for a second time from a clean tree, it fails with:
``
warning: github rate limit for anonymous requests exceeded: you must log in
``
presumably because after Yotta died it started using GitHub as a registry... sad. When will people learn. Apparently we were at 5000 API calls per hour. But if you don't clean the tree, you will be just fine.

= It is hard to do something useful with a devboard
{parent=Microprocessor development board}
{tag=Essays by Ciro Santilli}

In the 2010's/2020's, many people got excited about getting children in to &lt;electronics&gt; with cheap &lt;devboards&gt;, notably with &lt;Raspberry Pi&gt; and &lt;Arduino&gt;.

While there is some potential in that, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; always felt that this is very difficult to do, while also keeping his sacred principle of &lt;backward design&gt; in mind.

The reason for this is that "everyone" already has much more powerful computers at hand: their laptops/desktops and even &lt;mobile phones&gt; as of the 2020s. Except perhaps if you are thing specifically about poor countries.

Therefore, the advantage using such devboards for doing something that could useful must come from either:
* their low cost. This would be an important consideration if you were to mass produce your product, but that is not going to be the case for learners, at least initially.
* their portability, and closely linked their ability to act as sensors
* their ability to act as &lt;actuators&gt;, which is often missing from regular computers
* them having &lt;hardware accelerators&gt; that are not normally present in regular computers, e.g. &lt;FPGAs&gt; or &lt;AI accelerators&gt;. And then the demo project must demonstrate that the project is able to do something significantly faster/cheaper on the devboard than on a desktop computer.

Many devborads require a 5V power supply.

This is common on wall transformers and &lt;USB&gt;, but not in &lt;batteries&gt;.

When &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; was studying electronics at the &lt;University of São Paulo&gt;, the courses, which were heavily inspired from the &lt;USA&gt; 50's were obsessed by this one! Thinking about it, it is kind of a cool thing though.

That https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LC_circuit&amp;oldid=1085148789[Wikipedia page] is the epitome of &lt;it is not possible to teach natural sciences on Wikipedia&gt;[Wikipedia failure to explain things in a way that is of any interest to any learner]. &lt;video Tutorial on LC resonant circuits by w2aew (2012)&gt; is the opposite.

* https://youtu.be/hqhV50852jA?t=239 &lt;series LC circuit&gt; on a &lt;breadboard&gt; driven by an &lt;AC source&gt;. Shows behaviour on &lt;oscilloscope&gt; as source frequency is modified. We clearly see voltage going to zero at resonance. This is why thie circuit can be seen as a &lt;filter (signal processing)&gt;.
* https://youtu.be/hqhV50852jA?t=489 shows the &lt;parallel LC circuit&gt;. We clearly see current reaching a maximum on resonance.

{title=LC circuit dampened oscillations on an oscilloscope by Queuerious Guy (2014)}
{description=Finally a video that shows the oscillations without a driving &lt;AC source&gt;. The dude just move wires around on his &lt;breadboard&gt; manually, first charging the &lt;capacitor&gt; and then closing the LC circuit, and is able to see damped oscillations on the &lt;oscilloscope&gt;.}

{title=&lt;LC circuit&gt; by &lt;Eugene Khutoryansky&gt; (2016)}
{description=Exactly what you would expect from an &lt;Eugene Khutoryansky&gt; video. The key insight is that the &lt;inductor&gt; resists to changes in current. So when current is zero, it slows down the current. And when current is high, it tries to keep it going, which recharges the other side of the &lt;capacitor&gt;.}

= An LC circuit is analogous to a spring-mass system
{parent=LC circuit}
{tag=Spring-mass system}

Both are &lt;harmonic oscillators&gt;.

In the &lt;LC circuit&gt;:
* the current current may be seen as the velocity and containing the &lt;kinetic energy&gt;
* the charge stored in the capacitor as the &lt;potential energy&gt;

You can kickstart motion in either of those systems in two ways:
* charge the capacitor, i.e. pull the string, and then let it go, i.e. close the circuit. This is the simpler one to realise. Shown concretely at: &lt;video LC circuit dampened oscillations on an oscilloscope by Queuerious Guy (2014)&gt;
* give speed to the mass, i.e. make a current pass through the inductor

He participated in the development of the &lt;electrical telegraph&gt;, and he did some good modeling work that improved the foundations of the field, notably creating the &lt;telegrapher's equations&gt;.

He was one of those &lt;idealists&gt; who just want to do some cool work even if they have to starve for it, people had to get a state pension for him for his contributions. Nice guy. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oliver_Heaviside&amp;oldid=1230097796#Later_years_and_views[]:
&gt; In 1896, FitzGerald and John Perry obtained a civil list pension of £120 per year for Heaviside, who was now living in Devon, and persuaded him to accept it, after he had rejected other charitable offers from the &lt;Royal Society&gt;.
He also never married: https://www.nndb.com/people/627/000204015/

Mostly on vintage electronics. Lots of focus on &lt;microwave&gt;, which he has worked a lot with.

Has been going wild with restoration and reverse engineering of the Apollo moon mission.

&lt;Marc Verdiell&gt; is a &lt;French&gt; &lt;electrical engineer&gt; born in 1963 or 1964https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2001/20011129corp.htm{ref} and best known for being the creator and host of the &lt;CuriousMarc&gt; YouTube channel where he does &lt;mind blowing&gt; repairs and &lt;reverse engineering&gt; of vintage &lt;computers&gt; and other &lt;electronic&gt; equipment.

Marc sold his company &lt;LightLogic&gt;, an &lt;optoelectronics&gt; company he founded, to &lt;Intel&gt; in April 2001. This was just after the &lt;dot-com crash&gt;, but &lt;Intel&gt; apparently still correctly believed that the networking and the &lt;Internet&gt; would continue to grow and was investing in the area. His associate &lt;#Frank Shum&gt; sued claiming he should be credited for some of the inventions sold but lost and Marc got it all.https://www.courthousenews.com/inventor-barred-from-proceeds-of-intel-buyout/{ref}https://mergr.com/intel-acquires-lightlogic{ref}https://www.lightreading.com/business-management/lightlogic-bulks-up-under-intel{ref}. Marc was then almost immediately appointed an &lt;Intel fellow&gt; at the extremelly early age of 37, and then stayed for a few years at &lt;Intel&gt; until 2006 according to his LinkedIn.https://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2001/20011129corp.htm{ref}https://web.archive.org/web/20030213010020/http://www.intel.com/pressroom/kits/bios/verdiell.htm{ref}

Marc's full name is actualy &lt;Jean-Marc Verdiell&gt;, but &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; remembers there was one &lt;YouTube&gt; video where he mentions he gave up on "Jean" partly because &lt;anglophones&gt; would murder its pronounciation all the time.

Marc's &lt;PhD thesis&gt; is listed at: https://theses.fr/1990PA112048 and it is entitled:
&gt; Mise en phase de reseaux de lasers a semi-conducteur
which is translated into English as:
&gt; Phase locking of &lt;semiconductor laser&gt; arrays
but the full text is not available online.

{title=Profile of &lt;Marc Verdiell&gt; by Gizmodo (2018)}
{description=
https://youtu.be/tJ2-kkhghD4?t=74 gives his house's location &lt;Atherton, California&gt;, part of &lt;Silicon Valley&gt;.

https://youtu.be/ZgAreiFXhJk?t=253 lists some famous people who live there. It's like a micro heaven.

And a person who makes &lt;open educational content&gt; like Marc, truly deserves it.

Atherton managed to keep the entire place green and every house has a pool. Wikipedia comments https://web.archive.org/web/20220906010554/https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/features/most-expensive-zip-codes-us/[]:
&gt; Atherton is known for its wealth; in 1990 and 2019, Atherton was ranked as having the highest per capita income among U.S. towns with a population between 2,500 and 9,999, and it is regularly ranked as the most expensive ZIP Code in the United States \[(94027)\]. The town has very restricting zoning, only permitting one single-family home per acre and no sidewalks. The inhabitants have strongly opposed proposals to permit more housing construction and &lt;Forbes&gt; confirms it for 2022: https://web.archive.org/web/20220906010554/https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/features/most-expensive-zip-codes-us/[], by far on top.

Company founded by &lt;Marc Verdiell&gt; in his garage, and later acquired by &lt;Intel&gt; which was going on a &lt;optoelectronics&gt; buying spree. The division was later sold off in 2023 of course during more difficult times: https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/31/intel_silicon_photonics_jabil/

On &lt;Crunchbase&gt;: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lightlogic

It's hard to understand exactly what the company did by &lt;Googling&gt; it nowadays. Sad and usual fate. Presumably something related to &lt;transceiver&gt; for &lt;fiber-optic communication&gt;. Only the &lt;patents&gt; remain: https://patents.google.com/?assignee=lightlogic&amp;oq=lightlogic to tell its story to the brave.
