&lt;MacKenzie Bezos&gt; went on to marry a science teacher who taught their children.

The contrast with &lt;Bezos&gt;'s girlfriend is simply comical. MacKenzie married the idealistic morally upright science teacher, while Bezos went for a silly sex bomb. &lt;video O Quereres by Caetano Veloso (1984)&gt;[Ah, bruta flor, do querer]!

&gt; But as Scott's fame for giving away money has grown, so too has the deluge of appeals for gifts from strangers and old friends alike. That clamour may have driven Scott's already discreet operation further underground, with recent philanthropic announcements akin to sudden lightning bolts for unsuspecting recipients.

The name of the organization is a reference to &lt;the old man lost his horse&gt;.

I wonder where the spray painted sign went: https://twitter.com/profgalloway/status/1229952158667288576/photo/1[]. As mentioned at https://officechai.com/startups/amazon-first-office/ and elsewhere, Jeff did all he could to save money, e.g. he made the desks himself from pieces of wood.

Also mentions that if you do it naively, then you're going to say "also bought Harry Potter" for everyone (hugely popular book at the time). You've got to work harder to do better non obvious recommendations.

&lt;Amazon&gt; is apparently notorious for having bought off many competitors, many of them just to kill off the competition and clear the way, not to actually reuse them.

https://youtu.be/tfAhTtBlb2Q?t=849 from &lt;video Jeff Bezos Revealed by Bloomberg (2015)&gt; clearly shows &lt;Tim O'Reilly&gt; saying that very clearly about Bezos.
&gt; I do know of a number of cases in which he \[Bezos\] has acquired companies in order to take out competitors, potential future competitors. Rather than because he actually wants that business to continue.
Perhaps O'Reilly who is the bookselling business is not the greatest fan of Jeff. But still. My God.

Like &lt;Google custom silicon&gt;, &lt;Amazon&gt; server operations are so large that with the slowdown of &lt;Moore's law&gt;, it started being worth it for them to develop custom in-house silicon to serve as a competitive advantage, not to be sold for external companies. Can you imagine the scale required to justify silicon development investment that is not sold externally!

&gt; My team develops software for our next-generation Machine Learning accelerators: HAL, firmware, and SoC models.

2021: networking chip reports emerge: https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/3/30/22358633/amazon-reportedly-custom-network-switch-silicon-aws[], presumably contesting with the likes of &lt;Cisco&gt;?
