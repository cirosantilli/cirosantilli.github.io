= Radioactive
{synonym}

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; finds it interesting that radioactive decay basically kickstarted the domain of &lt;nuclear physics&gt; by essentially providing a natural &lt;particle accelerator&gt; from a chunk of radioactive element.

The discovery process was particularly interesting, including &lt;Henri Becquerel&gt;'s luck while observing &lt;phosphorescence&gt;, and &lt;Marie Curie&gt;'s observation that the &lt;uranium&gt; &lt;ore&gt; were more radioactive than pure uranium, and must therefore contain other even more radioactive substances, which lead to the discovery of &lt;polonium&gt; (&lt;half-life&gt; 138 days) and &lt;radium&gt; (half-life 1600 years).

{wiki}

= Alpha emitter
{synonym}

Most of the &lt;helium&gt; in the &lt;Earth&gt;'s atmosphere comes from alpha decay, since helium is lighter than air and naturally escapes out out of the atmosphere.

Wiki mentions that alpha decay is well modelled as a &lt;quantum tunnelling&gt; event, see also &lt;Geiger-Nuttall law&gt;.

As a result of that law, alpha particles have relatively little energy variation around 5 MeV or a speed of about 5% of the &lt;speed of light&gt; for any element, because the energy is inversely exponentially proportional to &lt;half-life&gt;. This is because:
* if the energy is much larger, decay is very fast and we don't have time to study the &lt;isotope&gt;
* if the energy is much smaller, decay is very rare and we don't have enough events to observe at all

{synonym}

&lt;Uranium&gt; emits them, you can see their mass to charge ratio under magnetic field and so deduce that they are &lt;electrons&gt;.

Caused by &lt;weak interaction&gt; TODO why/how.

The emitted electron kinetic energy is random from zero to a maximum value. The rest goes into a &lt;neutrino&gt;. This is how the neutrino was first discovered/observed indirectly. This is well illustrated in a &lt;decay scheme&gt; such as &lt;image caesium-137 decay scheme&gt;.

= Gamma ray
{parent=Type of radioactive decay}
{wiki}

Most commonly known as a byproduct &lt;radioactive decay&gt;.

Their energy is very high compared example to more common radiation such as &lt;visible spectrum&gt;, and there is a neat reason for that: it's because the &lt;strong force&gt; that binds &lt;nuclei&gt; is strong so transitions lead to large energy changes.

A &lt;decay scheme&gt; such as &lt;image caesium-137 decay scheme&gt; illustrates well how gamma radiation happens as a byproduct of &lt;radioactive decay&gt; due to the existence of &lt;nuclear isomer&gt;.

Gamma rays are pretty cool as they give us insight into the energy levels/different configurations of the nucleus.

They have also been used as early sources of high energy particles for &lt;particle physics&gt; experiments before the development of &lt;particle accelerators&gt;, serving a similar purpose to &lt;cosmic rays&gt; in those early days.

But &lt;gamma rays&gt; they were more convenient in some cases because you could more easily manage them inside a &lt;laboratory&gt; rather than have to go climb some bloody mountain or a &lt;balloon&gt;.

The &lt;positron&gt; for example was first observed on &lt;cosmic rays&gt;, but better confirmed in &lt;gamma ray&gt; experiments by &lt;Carl David Anderson&gt;.

= Half-life
{parent=Radioactive decay}
{wiki}

The &lt;half-life&gt; of &lt;radioactive decay&gt;, which as discovered a few years before &lt;quantum mechanics&gt; was discovered and matured, was a major mystery. Why do some nuclei fission in apparently random fashion, while others don't? How is the state of different nuclei different from one another? This is mentioned in &lt;Inward Bound by Abraham Pais (1988)&gt; Chapter 6.e Why a half-life?

The term also sees use in other areas, notably &lt;biology&gt;, where e.g. &lt;RNAs&gt; spontaneously decay as part of the &lt;cell&gt;'s &lt;control system&gt;, see e.g. mentions in &lt;E. Coli Whole Cell Model by Covert Lab&gt;.

{description=
&lt;J. J. Thomson&gt; took this picture in 1912:
&gt; There can, therefore, I think, be little doubt that what has been called &lt;neon&gt; is not a simple gas but a mixture of two gases, one of which has an atomic weight about 20 and the other about 22. The parabola due to the heavier gas is always much fainter than that due to the lighter, so that probably the heavier gas forms only a small percentage of the mixture.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; once visited the chemistry department of a world leading university, and the chemists there were obsessed with &lt;NMR&gt;. They had small benchtop &lt;NMR&gt; machines. They had larger machines. They had a room full of huge machines. They had them in corridors and on desk tops. Chemists really love that stuff. More precisely, these are used for &lt;NMR spectroscopy&gt;, which helps identify what a sample is made of.

Basically measures the concentration of certain isotopes in a region of space.

{description=
* only works with an odd number of &lt;nucleons&gt;
* apply strong &lt;magnetic field&gt;, this separates the energy of up and down spins. Most spins align with field.
* send &lt;radio waves&gt; into sample to make nucleons go to upper energy level. We can see that the energy difference is small since we are talking about radio waves, low frequency.
* when nucleon goes back down, it re-emits radio waves, and we detect that. TODO: how do we not get that confused with the input wave, which is presumably at the same frequency? It appears to send pulses, and then wait for the response.

Used to identify &lt;organic compounds&gt;.

Seems to be based on the effects that electrons around the nuclei (shielding electrons) have on the outcome of &lt;NMR&gt;.

So it is a bit unlike &lt;MRI&gt; where you are interested in the position of certain nuclei in space (of course, these being atoms, you can't see their positions in space).

* https://youtu.be/TQegSF4ZiIQ?t=465 usage of &lt;non-ionizing radiation&gt; (only &lt;radio frequencies&gt;) means that it is very safe to use. The only dangerous part is the magnetic field interacting with metallic objects.

{title=Dr Mansfield's MRI MEDICAL MARVEL by &lt;BBC&gt;}
{description=
Broadcast in 1978. Description:
&gt; Tomorrow's World gave audiences a true world first as Dr Peter Mansfield of the University of Nottingham demonstrated the first full body prototype device for &lt;Magnetic resonance imaging&gt; (MRI), allowing us to see inside the human body without the use of &lt;X-rays&gt;.
Featuring the yet-to-be &lt;2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine&gt; Dr. Mansfield.

This is a good book, it gives a summary of biographies, and a reasonable description of the main ideas, with many illustrations. Each subject is not presented in incredible detail, but it is a good overview of events.

The book unfortunately does not cover the history of &lt;quantum mechanics&gt; very, the author specifically says that this will not be covered, the focus is more on particles/forces. But there are still some mentions.

Always a bit too much on the superficial side, but sometimes OK, 5-10 minute videos.

URL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd02pSRrecAVFOPjB-bfv-Q

Covers some specific hardcore subjects, notably &lt;quantum electrodynamics&gt;, in full &lt;mathematical&gt; detail, e.g.: "Quantum Field Theory Lecture Series" playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSpklniGdSfSsk7BSZjONcfhRGKNa2uou

As of 2020 Dietterich was a &lt;condensed matter&gt; &lt;PhD&gt; candidate or post-doc at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, and he lives in &lt;Minnesota&gt;, sources:
* https://web.archive.org/web/20220112060801/https://cse.umn.edu/physics/graduate-students
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs9O1PZDtag
* https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Samuel-Dietterich-2

Unfortunately the channel is too obsessed with mathematical detail (which it does amazingly), and does not give enough examples/application/intuition, which is what would be useful to most people, thus falling too much on the hardcore side of &lt;the missing link between basic and advanced&gt;.

This channel does have on merit however: compared to other university courses, it is much more direct, which might mean that you get to something interesting before you got bored to death, &lt;you can learn more from older students than from faculty&gt;{full} comes to mind.

Videos generally involves short talks + a detailed read-through of a pre-prepared &lt;PDF&gt;. Dietterich has refused however giving the PDF or &lt;LaTeX&gt; source as of 2020 on comments unfortunately... what a &lt;open educational resources&gt;[wasted opportunity] for society. TODO find the comment. Sam, if you ever Google yourself to this page, let's make a collab on &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt; and fucking change education forever man.

{title=The Ultimate Goal Of My YouTube Channel by &lt;Dietterich Labs&gt; (2020)}
{description=In this video Dietterich gives his &lt;ideal&gt; for the channel. Notably, he describes how the few experimental videos he has managed to make were done in a opportunistic way from experiments that were happening around him. This resonated with &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s ideas from &lt;videos of all key physics experiments&gt;.}

Those guys are really good, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; especially enjoyed their &lt;quantum mechanics&gt; playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL193BC0532FE7B02C

The &lt;quantum electrodynamics&gt; one was a bit too slow paced for Ciro unfortunately, too much groundwork and too little results.

Videos licensed as &lt;CC BY-SA&gt;, those guys are so good.

These videos can give some geometric insight and do have their value.

But they are sometimes too slow, &lt;how to teach and learn physics&gt;[there are never any mention of experiments, just "the truth"].

And when things get "&lt;mathy&gt;", it sticks to a more qualitative view which may not be enough.

Very over the top with &lt;sexy&gt; demons and angels making appearances, and has some classic aesthetic artistic value :-)

Some insights, but too much on the &lt;popular science&gt; side of things.
