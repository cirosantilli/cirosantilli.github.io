As of 2020, &lt;education is broken&gt;[university has the following very important applications]:
* meet an &lt;Ciro Santilli's wife&gt;[intelligent sexual partner] (see also: &lt;sexual selection&gt;{full}, &lt;the main function of university is sexual selection&gt;{full}) and or have fun and or &lt;come out of the closet&gt;
* get you in debt if you are from the &lt;United States&gt;
Notably, &lt;education is an IQ test&gt;, not a way to learn &lt;How to teach/Explain how to make money with the lesson&gt;[useful] and &lt;How to teach/Explain why the subject is beautiful&gt;[beautiful] things.

One major issue is that teachers don't have the right incentive to, nor are selected to, teach well. Thus the existence of &lt;Rate My Professors&gt;! But we can do better...

Which is why &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; wants to destroy its current format with &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt;. He believes that we can find a more efficient organization to achieve both the social and research functions of university, by first doing as much as possible online

Ciro's university experiences are mentioned at: &lt;Ciro Santilli's formal education&gt;.

{tag=Cirism}
{tag=Education is broken}

This is a version of &lt;free gifted education&gt; but more focused on &lt;university&gt;.

This is &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s ideal university system. It is a system that actually lives up to the name "&lt;Open University&gt;":
* no enrolment, no prerequisites. &lt;Exam as a service&gt; examination style, likely free to anyone who wants to take them, only to determine:
  * who gets to use physical facilities, notably &lt;laboratories&gt;
  * which students do you want to pick as apprentices/workers/&lt;PhDs&gt;
* no tuition fees: &lt;free gifted education&gt;
* &lt;school must offer free accommodation for students&gt;
* &lt;force teachers to publish their teaching material with an open license&gt;
* &lt;how to teach&gt;

So far as of the early 2020's, the university that comes closest to some but not all of these principles is the &lt;University of the People&gt;. It's sad that it's such a crappy unknown thing, but it is what it is.

  &gt; Free University Brighton has been working since 2012 to provide an alternative and for the last five years we’ve been running ‘freegrees’. These are University level courses, open to all regardless of qualification. Our courses range from 4 week long introductory courses aimed at First Years (people who have never been to University before) to 12-week long Humanities, Social Sciences and Philosophy courses that rival anything in a ‘traditional’ University. We do this all with no money exchanged anywhere - no fees, no debt.

  Also, allow anyone to take the exams without enrolling (possibly for a fee if they don't have scholarship).

  This is the way to go if you really want to increase your impact/dollar and do something truly innovative that ill make a mark. Why just mirror existing university models that haven't yet caught up to the Internet Age?

You just have to spend a few minutes with students until they complain about the courses or teachers. And you just have to spend a few hours with teachers until they complain about the students or broader system.

University is broken, and everyone knows it. The only question now is finding a viable, "political cash flow positive" path, into something better.

= Universities are obsessed by their images
{parent=University is broken}

The image of an university is basically their only real asset, which they extract money out of via undergraduate students in some countries like the &lt;USA&gt;, and by getting funding.

For this reason, universities will sacrifice basically any principle in order to give themselves a good image.

Although for profit companies also do this, it is simply on another level for universities.

= The main function of university is sexual selection
{parent=University is broken}
{tag=Cirism}

This is the actual main function of university for many people as of the 2020s. And it fulfills it quite well. A breeding ground.

In a closely related sense, university is simply a symbol of personal status. Not a place where you go to learn. And especially in the Anglophone world of fancy &lt;collegiate university&gt;[colleges], university also doubles down as a form of long term luxury hotel. Even if it ends up meaning debt.

There's nothing wrong with sexual selection. This type of natural &lt;eugenics&gt; is an important part of humankind. It is however just sad that &lt;the only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories&gt;[any type of learning] falls so much behind. A close second would be fine. But as it stands, it is just too far off.

= University should focus on inspiring and not on evaluating
{parent=The ideal university}

As of 2020s and much earlier, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; believes that &lt;undergrad&gt; studies were fundamentally broken (considering the &lt;Information Age&gt; which completely changed what would be possible) because university had only two goals, with the exception of a few enlightened professors:
* rank students from worse to best so they can get into &lt;PhD&gt; programs.

  For regular jobs grades didn't even matter as much compared the prestige of your university (and therefore, &lt;university entry exam&gt; grades) and your ability to stand the stress of exams to get minimal passing grade.

  In particular, being able to rank requires setting the difficulty level at a point where you can see a &lt;normal distribution&gt; in grades, and not have everyone at either 0 nor 100%.

  Also, this split could be caused by either shitty learning materials/conditions, or by mere volume. It doesn't matter.
* get money from the students. Of course, in countries where university is "free", this means reporting how many students you had to some government office so they can give you a corresponding budget. But you still have an incentive to enroll as many as possible.
As a result, most students, who would not go on to do a &lt;PhD&gt; essentially do a simple trade: all their time, and possibly some money, in exchange for imbuing themselves with the incredible name of a respected institution so they can get better jobs later on.

Beauty, deep understanding, and learning awesome things comes basically as a second thought.

= The only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories
{parent=The ideal university}

Besides of course &lt;the main function of university is sexual selection&gt;[sexual selection], considering in this section only "formal learning" activities.

Consider e.g. the 2020 &lt;University of Oxford&gt;, where many many people are taking courses without any &lt;laboratory&gt; work (and also without much use at all) like literature and history, and they are paying about 9k &lt;pounds&gt;/year for it: &lt;how much it costs to study at the University of Oxford?&gt;.

Basically all of this could be done &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt;[online from books].

Laboratories are impossible however, because expendables of every experiment you do cost from hundreds to thousands of dollars, not to mention crazy upfront equipment costs.

For this reason, the brick and mortar aspect universities should focus exclusively on laboratories, and ensuring that the students with the most relevant knowledge (which can be readily obtained online) get access to those laboratories. Students should of course fully master every aspect of theory pertinent to their experiments. &lt;principal investigators&gt; should hand pick whichever criteria they want to select their students, possibly based partly on &lt;exam as a service&gt; if they find it a useful metric.

Furthermore, the use of laboratories should put great focus on &lt;novel research&gt;. A lot of laboratory instruction could be done from video of an experiments. As much as possible, we should use laboratories for novel research. Related: &lt;videos of all key physics experiments&gt;{full}.

= When in doubt, choose the course that has the most experimental work
{parent=The only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories}
{tag=Cirism}

You can always learn pure theory later on for free or very cheap from books.

And above all, you can always learn &lt;software engineering&gt; later on for free, because the programming community is so much more open than any other so far, notably e.g. with &lt;Stack Overflow&gt; and &lt;GitHub&gt;, see also: &lt;Ciro Santilli's Open Source Enlightenment&gt;{full}. &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; is trying to change that with &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt;, but don't hold your breath. But it is increasingly hard to understand &lt;force teachers to publish their teaching material with an open license&gt;[why there isn't an university that forces teachers to publish all their notes and lecture videos (which should be mandatorily recorded) with a Creative Commons License], and then let &lt;exam as a service&gt;[anyone take whichever exams they want for a small fee or for free].

Actually, there is a good chance you will learn to program, like it or not, because chances are that you won't be able to find as decent a job doing anything else.

But there is one thing you cannot learn for free: laboratory work. Laboratory work is just &lt;the only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories&gt;[too expensive to carry out outside of an institution].

Basically, if you don't do laboratory work in &lt;undergrad&gt;, you will very likely never be able to do so in your entire life.

Because laboratories are so rare and expensive, it is laboratories that put you in the best most unfair position at creating world changing &lt;deep tech&gt; startups, which is why &lt;when in doubt, choose the course that has the most experimental work&gt;. Yes, you won't be able to achieve those insanely concentrated &lt;equities&gt; of the early-&lt;Internet&gt;, as you will need more &lt;venture capital&gt; to run your company, but those days are over now, deal with it.

= University policy
{parent=University}

= University IP ownership
{parent=University policy}

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s general feeling is that university should not own IP, it should belong to the researchers. Instead, university should help researchers make their startups, so they can become big, and then we can tax them and reinvest in the universities.

Of course, this goes through the &lt;nonprofit impact measurement&gt; difficulty. Maybe we could instead limit the IP to some reasonably small percentage, like 10%?

But still, as of 2020, if feels like universities are way too greedy.

* https://youtu.be/ji5_MqicxSo?t=1406 Achieving Your Childhood Dreams by Randy Pausch (2007). At this timestamp he tells a story about how university IP issues almost ruined a collaboration he was passionate about.

&lt;Public university&gt; and also universities with &lt;charity&gt; status, e.g. since &lt;most British universities are registered as charities&gt;{full}.

Any lectures must be recorded. But of course, &lt;how to teach/text is cheaper than video&gt;.

Just fucking pay teachers a decent salary comparable to industry instead of basically requiring them to try and sell their knowledge to complement their income. They must get paid, and their knowledge must 

We don't need that many teachers teaching the same subjects over and over. We just need a &lt;Brooks's law&gt;[few good men and women] who can truly teach the masses. And we must pay those men and women a decent wage.

The perfect platform for this will of course be &lt;OurBigBook.com&gt; ;-)

These are the most evil examinations society has.

They mean that until you are 18, you have to study a bunch of generic crap you hate just to get into university. Rather than &lt;Self-directed learning&gt;[studying whatever it is that you truly love to become a God at it as fast as possible and have any chance of advancing the field].

And then, if you decide that you want to change, which is not unlikely since you haven't really try to study what you signed up for before then, it can be very hard and time consuming, leading to a bunch of adults with useless degress they will never use at work.

With the invention of the &lt;Internet&gt;, all teaching material can be free and open source. Only &lt;the only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories&gt;[laboratory space] has any cost (besides the opportunity cost of participation in actual projects in a research team).

The "Truth and Beauty" motto hugely coincides with &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;'s ideas.

Truth is easier somewhat as it is more subjective.

Beauty, like all arts, sometimes you achieve, sometimes you don't.

Searcing beauty is a painful thing. You just keep endlessly looking for that one new insight that will blow your mind.

The key missing point would be "usefulness". See also: &lt;art&gt;{full}.

&lt;Ciro Santilli's formal education&gt;[Ciro Santilli studied there] for a few years starting in 2007.

In retrospect, doing electrical engineering (and likey the other engineering degrees) felt like taking a trip to the 60s in the &lt;United States&gt;, due to both the subject matter, and how old the concrete buildings were!

This does not need to be a bad thing. It is in that era (and earlier) that much of the exciting foundations of the field were set, and there is great value in &lt;there is value in tutorials written by early pioneers of the field&gt;. Not that they were amazing at excting history lessons as they should be. But the course outline suggested that intent.

But that point of view must also be accompanied by the excitement of the great ongoing advances of technology (and impact they had in the past). And on that, they failed.

One day, one day, we will fix that.

{wiki}

https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/São_Remo

While in Brazil, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; used to walk through the outskirts of a small &lt;favela&gt; to get &lt;University of São Paulo&gt;[to university] every day, the https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/São_Remo[Favela de São Remo].

See the street view for: https://goo.gl/maps/ZVnTjxNpsK6QPqTE9[R. Catumbi - Vila Butantã Vila Butantã, São Paulo - State of São Paulo, Brazil], e.g. https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.5611635,-46.7449982,3a,75y,77.15h,72.78t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swNEwJR0x5wkuKHvp7c0IHw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192[with this link].

To the left, the outer walls of a large police station, with &lt;concertina wire&gt; on top and all.

To the right, dudes &lt;drug traffic&gt;[selling drugs] on the entry of a small corridor street, presumably to which they could easily escape to in case of need.

The cops could have identified the dealers with binoculars if they actually wanted to!!!

The drug sellers did keep the peace in their business area, and Ciro never got robbed, and would come back from university parties on foot late through the favela.

But Ciro's friends did say that things got much worse after Ciro left, for example http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2015/01/engenheiro-e-vitima-de-sequestro-relampago-na-cidade-universitaria.html[a flash kidnapping was reported in 2015].

Wikipedia says that this favela started in the 60s and 70s as settlements of the builders of the University, and that many of the people there still work for the University.

This is consistent with the terribly old buildings Ciro saw when he was at university. They even had the building skills to build their own homes.

The state just has to either &lt;legalize&gt; those people, or give them houses somewhere else nearby. A &lt;what poor countries have to do to get richer&gt;[world class University is the most important thing a poor country can have], and its image cannot be jeopardized like that.

The existence of that favela, right next to one of the most important universities in Latin America, puts &lt;Brazil&gt;'s surreal social inequality into perspective. Especially considering that before extremely heavy &lt;university entry quotas&gt; were added, basically all students of the university (or at least of the courses that lead to high paying jobs) had attended private schools, and therefore were not of the poorer classes (see passage about 10 out 500 passage from &lt;free gifted education&gt;{full}).

The janitors of the apartment block Ciro lived all lived in the favela. Yes, in poor countries lives are worth nothing, and some poorer people work by watching the entrance of buildings of less poor people 24/7 to guard it from other even more desperate poor people who might want to rob the not so poor inhabitants. They also do janitor jobs like cleaning common areas in parallel.

They were incredibly nice hard-working people, and Ciro spoke often with them. If only given the opportunity, those people could be amazing engineers or scientists obviously. Ciro was also glad to be their friends, and sat down with them quite a few times for several minutes after coming back from University parties, partly because he felt bad about them having to work at that time, but also partly because he just liked them. And they were always up to date on who had come back with a girl to the apartment or not. Ciro imagines that if it had been him, it would have been a perfect bragging opportunity ;)

They had "nothing" but were still happy. This is true wisdom, and a good reminder &lt;Buddhism&gt;[that all our non-transhumanist technical goals are nothing].

We must destroy &lt;social inequality&gt;.

{synonym}

No, they are basically &lt;not-for-profits&gt;, or more precisely in british legal terms, "&lt;charities&gt;". By taking government funding (directly or indirectly through subsiding enrolment fees?), they have to follow some government rules, and all major ones do it seems: https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/49187/in-what-sense-are-uk-universities-public/49188

A similar confusing naming pattern appears to apply to &lt;Public school (united-kingdom)&gt;.

In the &lt;University of Cambridge&gt; for example, all MA degree holders or higher appear to have some voting power: https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work/governance (https://web.archive.org/web/20210811192322/https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work/governance[archive])

This adds an extra layer of difficulty for the average taxpayer to make changes to university policy, e.g. making universities publish all material with &lt;Creative Commons licenses&gt;. At most, voters could require this indirectly through the government funding requisites. It is a mess.

Not even the &lt;Open University&gt; seems to be very open!

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; once attended a round table in the early 2020s where a &lt;University of Oxford&gt; official from the IP licensing department. The &lt;University of Oxford&gt; took a 20% equity on &lt;spin-off companies&gt;, not an uncommon &lt;University IP ownership&gt; policy at the time. At one point, the officer clearly justified this along the following very official sounding lines (paraphrased):
&gt; The university is a &lt;charity&gt; with the goal of promoting education and research. All money obtained is reinvested in furthering education and research.
While noble sounding, this immediately reminded Ciro of &lt;instrumental convergence&gt;, in the field of &lt;AGI&gt; philosophy. Or in other words, of course the best approach to maximize education and research outcomes of society is to first &lt;take over the world&gt;, and then implement those goals from there! See also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5pUA3LsEaw[Why Not Just: Think of AGI Like a Corporation? by Robert Miles (2018)]

Notably, the &lt;University of Oxford&gt; was extremely protective of its learning material at that time, which was highly paywalled behind university logins, presumably with the rationale of having unique learning materials to enroll more paying undergrads. How can giving out free information to all not be the optimal way to "promoting education and research" is very hard to envision.

Not really dedicated to open source course material, nor to free courses...

The "Open" in its name only made sense in the 60's, when it was founded, nowadays, there isn't much about this institution that is very different compared to traditional &lt;Oxbridge&gt;. "Cheap more online university" would be a more adequate name for it.

A system that would truly live up to the name "Open" in the year 2020 is the one described at &lt;the ideal university&gt; by &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;.

Wikipedia even says that the initial focus was on broadcasting learning material on &lt;television&gt; and &lt;radio&gt;, so what happened to that now that we have an even more powerful on-demand tool called &lt;Internet&gt;!

They even created their own MOOC website, &lt;FutureLearn&gt;. But https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/massive-open-online-courses-started-out-completely-free-but-where-are-they-now-1dd1020f59/ mentions:
&gt; The course content is still free to access, but it’s only available for the duration of the course, and for two weeks after it ends.
OMG. God why.

A few open sources at: https://www.open.edu/openlearn/free-courses[]. The 5-hour course on &lt;particle physics&gt; says it all. Stated as of 2023 at https://www.open.ac.uk/about/open-educational-resources/openlearn/free-learning[]:
&gt; The OU provides around 5% of its formal course materials as free open educational content every year on OpenLearn

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj0rbafFBak What's an Open University Degree Like? by Luke Cutforth (2021) mentions that it is more &lt;autodidactic&gt;/online, and it encourages part time learning.

https://youtu.be/rsWwffX-u0A?t=99 Open University - How does it work? by Matt Greg Vlogs (2017) shows that they do have their own custom institutional material. And it is not open???? Please. https://youtu.be/rsWwffX-u0A?t=222 mentions that there is no entry exam, and you can change your courses at any time, that is good at least.

&lt;Israel&gt; apparently also created their own version in the 70's inspired by the British one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_University_of_Israel[Open University of Israel]. Same story it seems.
