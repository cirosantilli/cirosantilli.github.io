Higher level than &lt;Csound&gt;: describes the notes only, not the exact waveforms it seems.

Therefore also a bit harder to convert to actual sound: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33775336/convert-musicxml-to-wav but possibly easier to convert to &lt;LilyPond&gt;.

Now they need to create a "MusicCSS" that gives the waveforms! :-)

{title2=ALSA}
{wiki}

ALSA can be thought as analogous to  physical wires linking up machines.

Except that instead of machines, you have separate programs. One such typical link is:
* from a MIDI source, e.g. &lt;vmpk&gt; or a &lt;MIDI&gt; editor with playback like &lt;Ardour (software)&gt;
* to a synthesizer like &lt;FluidSynth&gt; or &lt;ZynAddSubFX&gt;

The advantage of this setup is that separate programs can collaborate to make complex sounds. 

The disadvantage of this setup is that it makes it very hard to reproduce results, you basically need a &lt;Docker (software)&gt; image with the exact same version of everything. And some script to launch and connect all programs correctly.

Some composition systems like &lt;LMMS&gt; reduce that problem by having synthesizers as plugins, so that you don't have to setup any connections yourself.

= Bristol

{c}
{parent=Software synthesizer}
{wiki}

Simulates vintage &lt;hardware synthesizers&gt;, and includes some pretty complex ones!

Aims to show an UI that looks exactly like the synthesizers in question.

For example for the &lt;Minimoog&gt; on &lt;Ubuntu&gt; 20.04:
``
sudo apt install bristol
startBristol -mini -alsa
``

This is a really good piece of software. You can search on &lt;YouTube&gt; how some classic synths, work, and the immediately start playing them!

Synthesizes MIDI input. &lt;vmpk&gt; + `aconnect` + &lt;Advanced Linux Sound Architecture&gt; &lt;hello world&gt;: https://askubuntu.com/questions/34391/virtual-midi-piano-keyboard-setup/1298026#1298026

Supports only very basic effects it seems: &lt;chorus effect&gt; and &lt;reverberation&gt;. The main way to add instruments to it is via &lt;SoundFont&gt; files.

https://askubuntu.com/questions/220802/no-sound-zynaddsubfx-and-jack-wont-run/1297988#1297988

Contains a large database of instruments, and allows you to edit them. This is a fun toy.

Instruments are edited on a &lt;GUI&gt;. It is a multi-window program, and you open new windows from new windows from new windows, all filled with hundreds of virtual knobs that you drag with your keyboard, and which would be better done from textual software like &lt;Csound&gt;. It is a thing of beauty.

It does not seem possible to program arbitrary &lt;modular synthesizer&gt; circuits therefore. But if you understand &lt;additive synthesis&gt; and &lt;subtractive synthesis&gt; well, you can make some funky sounds with it.

It is basically a superset of all popular &lt;hardware synthesizers&gt; ever made.

Has its own built-in MIDI keyboard which is nice.

On Ubuntu 20.04 Version: 3.0.5:
``
sudo apt install zynaddsubfx
zynaddsubfx -O alsa
``
as per https://askubuntu.com/questions/220802/no-sound-zynaddsubfx-and-jack-wont-run/1297988#1297988
To do anything of interest, switch to the Advanced UI:
* Misc
* Switch Interface Mode

The UI is completely different form what is shown on the website as of 2020: https://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.io/[], it looks instead like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVPr6iUuO3g[] Maybe on the website it is the new zyn-fusion UI... https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxaudio/comments/bxn3ur/some_help_for_installing_zynfusion_zynaddsubfx/ so confusing.

And they have some crappy policy of asking for 45 USD for binary downloads.

= Scorewriter
{parent=GUI music editor}
{wiki}

Basically a &lt;GUI music editor&gt; where you can specifically see and export classical music notation instead of tablature-style notation.

Best open source one found so far as of 2020: &lt;MuseScore&gt;.

= MuseScore
{c}
{parent=Scorewriter}
{wiki}

https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore

This software feels amazing. You can really start composing very quickly, lots of features, good keyboard shortcuts.

GPL, and there's a backing company that makes money with an online and mobile version of it.

Can export to:
* &lt;MIDI&gt;
* &lt;PDF&gt;

Ubuntu 20.04: sound preview worked, first hat that trailing Contra-like sound artifacts (like `spd-say`), but then it went away?

Feels like a lot of effort was put into usability, including keyboard shortcuts by default, seems like a powerful and easy to start using software to compose music!

Glissando: yes: https://musescore.org/en/handbook/arpeggios-and-glissandi

= TuxGuitar
{c}
{parent=Scorewriter}

Just use &lt;MuseScore&gt; instead.

Weight: light.

Can import from: &lt;MIDI&gt;.

Can export to:
* &lt;MIDI&gt;
* &lt;MusicXML&gt;
* &lt;LilyPond&gt;

&lt;Ubuntu&gt; 20.04:
``
sudo apt install tuxguitar tuxguitar-alsa tuxguitar-jsa tuxguitar-oss
``
`tuxguitar-jsa` was needed, otherwise no sound: https://askubuntu.com/questions/457321/tuxguitar-no-sound-in-14-04

Has OK step sequencer non-realtime up/down/left/right guitar based composition interface.

Has chord insertion.

Has bend editor.

Could be more amazing, but it is OK.

A bit limited by being very "guitar oriented". Shows you guitar strings, and you enter offset to each string. So to enter two adjacent notes you need to use two seprate strings and thing about the offsets. If only it had a more piano based interface.

Drum notation is also atrocious, you have to go to the top chord, and use high numbers starting at 36.

Very easy to use and pretty powerful &lt;MIDI&gt; creator!!!

One of the rare audio applications actually works with PulseAudio on Ubuntu 20.04 out-of-the-box, so you don't have to turn off every other audio application!!!

Has lot's of plugins built-in just working out of the box, e.g. &lt;ZynAddSubFX&gt; out-of-the-box without doing a gazillion complex setup connections.

Most plugins are just simple toys however, &lt;ZynAddSubFX&gt; is the only super powerful one. The others are more LMMS integrate however, and seem to use a more dedicated LMMS &lt;GUI&gt; style.

TODO can you do liver performance with a virtual instrument?

* https://lmms.io/forum/viewtopic.php?t=28504

If you open &lt;vmpk&gt;, you can then right click on a piano track, and go MIDI, Input and it just shows up there, and it does produce sound as shown at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpeP2th08ak

= Csound
{c}
{parent=Text-based music synthesizer}
{wiki}

https://www.csounds.com/

https://github.com/csound/csound

&lt;XML&gt; file format (but with 99% of the action of interest in a &lt;domain-specific language&gt; on the `CsInstruments` and `CsScore` elements) that can be played and the reference implementation. Offers complex effects out-of-box apparently.

Allows you to easily define instruments with seemingly arbitrary mathematical functions, and then use them to play notes at given time intervals.

The instrument functions can be parametrized, and each note played can have different parameters.

The instrument definition actually defines a block diagram graph, much like a hardware synthesizer would.

Csound is so not-bloated that it contains an UI system. And it includes an interactive virtual MIDI keyboard that interacts with parameter knobs: http://www.csounds.com/manual/html/MidiTop.html

But hey, it's fun. And like any other good &lt;domain-specific language&gt;, &lt;debugging&gt; it is barbaric of course.

If only it had been written in &lt;Python&gt;... the array manipulation boilerplate would be likely perfect for &lt;NumPy&gt;, and this would have been exactly what &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; wanted!

CSound states that one of its design goals is backward compatibility, and it shows. Some of the stuff is utterly arcane, e.g. you have to remember what `GEN10`, `GEN11`, etc. mean instead of having named enums.

It just worked on &lt;Ubuntu&gt; 20.04 no questions asked:
``

``
or pipe to stdout to &lt;FFmpeg&gt; TODO: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64970503/how-to-pipe-csound-output-to-ffmpeg-for-conversion-without-an-intermediate-file

Documentation-wise, it's a bit lacking. The only dude who can explain it really well, Dr https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Boulanger[Richard Boulanger], made the "The Csound Book" &lt;closed source&gt;, so, congrats, this will forever hurt the popularity of Csound.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; defines "Smooth Jazz" simply as jazz that he can leave on the background to work without being particularly distracted.

It does not mean that the music is bad in any way. Just not particularly distracting.

Pop music cannot be good by definition: any &lt;art&gt; that appeals to the masses (Popular!) has to be a boring watered down version of everything, and therefore boring shit. Just like the movies: &lt;high budget movies are shit&gt;.

You have to know the language to appreciate them.

The 60's and 70's were the days, those great https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war[proxy wars] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor[CIA dictatorships] allowed hippies to make awesome freedom music without too imminent a fear of death.

Songs making fun of things or that are pure &lt;Brazil&gt; nostalgia are also accepted. No love songs, ever. Except &lt;popular Brazilian music&gt;[some by Caetano], but that's it!

{parent=Musical instrument}
{wiki}

The &lt;guitar&gt; is a highly imperfect instrument if compared to something like a &lt;piano&gt;, which is much more &lt;mathematically&gt; elegant.

However, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; just loves this imperfection for some reason, especially in the case of the &lt;electric guitar&gt;.

Bending, sliding and strumming just feel to good to not have.

And Ciro sucks are doing things in parallel, so the more single threaded approach of the guitar fits his brain/abilities better.

For those reasons, the &lt;electric guitar&gt; is Ciro's favorite &lt;musical instrument&gt;.

The piano is the most elegant non-electronic instrument. But it requires way too many strings, so expensive and not portable.

Also it allows for no &lt;legato&gt; or &lt;vibrato&gt;.

The &lt;guitar&gt; is kind of the opposite.

After computer &lt;sound synthesis&gt; however, all of these distinctions become meaningless.
