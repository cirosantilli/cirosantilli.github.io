= SQL example
{c}
{parent=SQL}

We have some runnable &lt;SQL&gt; examples with &lt;assertion (software development)&gt; under the `sequelize/raw` directory.

These examples are written in the &lt;Sequelize&gt; library using raw queries.

Sequelize is used minimally, just to feed raw queries in transparently to any underlying database, and get minimally parsed results out for us, which we then assert with standard &lt;JavaScript&gt;. The queries themselves are all written by hand.

By default the examples run on &lt;SQLite&gt;. Just like the examples from &lt;sequelize example&gt;, you can set the database at runtime as:
* `./index.js` or `./index.js l`: &lt;SQLite&gt;
* `./index.js p`: &lt;PostgreSQL&gt;. You must manually create a database called `tmp` and ensure that peer authentication works for it

Here we list only examples which we believe are standard SQL, and should therefore work across different SQL implementations:
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/raw/index.js]: basic hello world to demonstrate the setup and very simple functionality
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/raw/many_to_many.js]: illustrates &lt;many-to-many relations&gt; with &lt;JOIN (SQL)&gt;. Contains:
* &lt;SQL transaction&gt; examples:
  * \a[nodejs/sequelize/raw/commit_error.js]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27245101/why-should-we-use-rollback-in-sql-explicitly/27245234#27245234 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48277519/how-to-use-commit-and-rollback-in-a-postgresql-function/48277708#48277708 suggest that on &lt;PostgreSQL&gt;, once something fails inside a transaction, all queries in the current transaction are ignored, and `COMMIT` simply does a `ROLLBACK`. Let's check. Yup, true for Postgres, but false for &lt;SQLite&gt;, SQLite just happily runs anything it can, you really need `ROLLBACK` for it.
  * &lt;SQL isolation level example&gt;
* &lt;GROUP BY (SQL)&gt; and &lt;SQL aggregate functions&gt;:
  * \a[nodejs/sequelize/raw/group_by_extra_column.js]: let's see if it blows up or not on different DB systems, &lt;sqlite3 Node.js package&gt; allows it:
    * https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/5481#issuecomment-964387232
    * https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/141594/how-select-column-does-not-list-in-group-by-clause/141600 says that it was allowed in &lt;SQL:1999&gt; when there are no ambiguities due to constraints, e.g. when grouping by unique columns
    * https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/REL_13_5/src/test/regress/sql/functional_deps.sql#L27 shows that &lt;PostgreSQL&gt; wants it to work for `UNIQUE NOT NULL`, but they just haven't implemented it as of 13.5, where it only works if you group by `PRIMARY KEY`
    * https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/158015/why-can-i-select-all-fields-when-grouping-by-primary-key-but-not-when-grouping-b also says that `UNIQUE NOT NULL` doesn't work. Dan Lenski then points to a rationale mailing list thread.
  * \a[nodejs/sequelize/raw/group_by_max_full_row.js]: here we try to get the full row of each group at which a given column reaches the max of the group
    * &lt;Postgres&gt;: has `SELECT DISCINTCT ON` which works perfectly if you only want one row in case of multiple rows attaining the max. `ON` is an extension to the standard unfortunately: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/sql-select.html#SQL-DISTINCT[] Docs specify that it always respects `ORDER BY` when selecting the row.
      * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/586781/postgresql-fetch-the-row-which-has-the-max-value-for-a-column asks it without the multiple matches use case
        * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/586781/postgresql-fetch-the-rows-which-have-the-max-value-for-a-column-in-each-group/587209#587209 also present in simpler form at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/121387/fetch-the-rows-which-have-the-max-value-for-a-column-for-each-distinct-value-of/123481#123481 gives a very nice &lt;OUTER JOIN&gt; only solution! Incredible, very elegant.
      * https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/171938/get-only-rows-with-max-group-value asks specifically the case of multiple matches to the max
    * &lt;SQLite&gt;:
      * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48326957/row-with-max-value-per-group-sqlite
        * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48326957/row-with-max-value-per-group-sqlite/48328243#48328243 teaches us that in SQLite min and max are magic and guarantee that the matching row is returned

PostgreSQL feels good.

Its feature set is insanely large! Just look at stuff like: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1986491/sql-split-string-by-space-into-table-in-postgresql/1993058#1993058

Had a look at the source tree, and also felt good.

If &lt;Oracle&gt; is the &lt;Microsoft&gt; of database, Postgres is the &lt;Linux&gt;, and &lt;MySQL&gt; (or more precisely &lt;MariaDB&gt;) is the &lt;FreeBSD&gt; (i.e. the one that got delayed by legal issues). Except that their &lt;software licenses&gt; were accidentally swapped.

The only problem with Postgres is its name. PostgreSQL is so unpronounceable and so untypeable that you should just call it "Postgres" like everyone else.

{parent=PostgreSQL}

On Ubuntu 20.10 PostgreSQL 12.6, login with `psql` on my default username without &lt;sudo&gt; fails with: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11919391/postgresql-error-fatal-role-username-does-not-exist

This is the one that worked on &lt;Ubuntu 21.04&gt;: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11919391/postgresql-error-fatal-role-username-does-not-exist/38444152#38444152
``
sudo -u postgres createuser -s $(whoami)
createdb $(whoami)
``
Explanation:
* `sudo -u postgres` uses the `postgres` user via &lt;peer authentication&gt;
* `-s` in `createuser -s`: make it a superuser
* `createdb`: TODO why do we have to create a table with the same name as the user? Otherwise login fails.

You can now run `psql` without any password. This works without password due to peer authentication:
``
sudo cat /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf
``
shows that peer authentication is available to all users apparently:
``
local   all             postgres                                peer

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     peer
``

List users:
``
psql -c '\du'
``
output:
``
                                    List of roles
  Role name  |                         Attributes                         | Member of

 postgres    | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}
``

Delete user later on:
``
psql -c 'DROP USER username;'
``

Create a database:
``
createdb testdb0
``

``

``

Get help for Postgres commands such as `\h` and so on:
``

``

``

``

List all databases:

(6 rows)
``

Delete a database:
``
psql -c 'DROP DATABASE "testdb0";'
``

If you didn't give a database from the command line e.g.:
``
psql
``
you can do that afterwards with:
``
\c testdb0
``

Let's create a table and test that it is working:
``
psql testdb0 -c 'CREATE TABLE table0 (int0 INT, char0 CHAR(16));'
``

List tables, no special tables:
``
psql testdb0 -c '\dt'
``
gives:
``
        List of relations
 Schema |  Name  | Type  | Owner
--------+--------+-------+-------
 public | table0 | table | ciro
(1 row)
``

View table schema: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/109325/postgresql-describe-table
``
psql testdb0 -c '\d+ table0'
``
output:
``
                                      Table "public.table0"

``

Insert some data into it and get the data out:
``
psql testdb0 -c "INSERT INTO table0 (int0, char0) VALUES (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (5, 'five'), (7, 'seven');"
psql testdb0 -c 'SELECT * FROM table0;'
``

    2 | two

Delete the table:

= Generate random text in PostgreSQL
{parent=PostgreSQL create test data}

This one is good: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36533429/generate-random-string-in-postgresql/44200391#44200391 as it also describes how to generate multiple values.
``
with symbols(characters) as (VALUES ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'))
select string_agg(substr(characters, (random() * (length(characters) - 1) + 1)::INTEGER, 1), '')
from symbols
join generate_series(1,8) as word(chr_idx) on 1 = 1 -- word length
join generate_series(1,10000) as words(idx) on 1 = 1 -- # of words
group by idx;
``

Then you can insert it into a row with:
``
create table tmp(s text);
insert into tmp(s)
  select s from
  (
    with symbols(characters) as (VALUES ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'))
    select string_agg(substr(characters, (random() * (length(characters) - 1) + 1)::INTEGER, 1), '') as asdf
    from symbols
    join generate_series(1,8) as word(chr_idx) on 1 = 1 -- word length
    join generate_series(1,10000) as words(idx) on 1 = 1 -- # of words
    group by idx
  ) as sub(s);
``

A more convenient approach is likely to define the function:
``
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION random_string(int) RETURNS TEXT as $$
select
  string_agg(substr(characters, (random() * length(characters) + 1)::integer, 1), '') as random_word
from (values('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789    --')) as symbols(characters)
  join generate_series(1, $1) on 1 = 1
$$ language sql;
``

And then:
``
create table tmp(s text, t text);
insert into tmp(s) select random_string(10) from generate_series(10);
``

= PostgreSQL full-text search
{parent=PostgreSQL HOWTO}
{tag=Full-text search}

This section was tested on &lt;Ubuntu 24.10&gt;, &lt;PostgreSQL&gt; 16.6.

Let's create some test data like this:
``
time psql tmp -c 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS fts;'
time psql tmp -c 'CREATE TABLE fts(s TEXT, i INTEGER);'
time psql tmp &lt;&lt;'EOF'
INSERT INTO fts SELECT
  i::text || ' ' ||
    (i * 2  )::text || ' ' ||
    (i * 5  )::text || ' ' ||
    (i * 7  )::text || ' ' ||
    (i * 11 )::text || ' ' ||
    (i * 13 )::text || ' ' ||
    (i * 17 )::text || ' ' ||
    (i * 23 )::text || ' ' ||
    (i * 29 )::text || ' ' ||
    (i * 31 )::text
  ,
  i % 100
FROM generate_series(1::bigint, 100000000::bigint) AS s(i);
EOF
``

The creation time was 2m13s, and the final size was:
``
    table_name    | pg_size_pretty | pg_total_relation_size
------------------+----------------+------------------------
 fts              | 13 GB          |            14067326976
``

This test data will be simple to predict what each line contains so we can make educated queries, while also posing some difficulty to the RDMS. As per:
``
time psql tmp -c 'SELECT * FROM fts LIMIT 10;'
``
the first columns look like:
``
                  s                  | i

We aimed to create a test table of size around 10 GB, as in practice it is around that order of size that index speedups start to become very obvious on a &lt;SSD&gt;-based system.

Before we create the index, let's see if our non-indexed queries are slow enough for our tests:
``
time psql tmp -c "SELECT * FROM fts WHERE s LIKE '% 50000000 %';"
``
which gives:
``
                                                 s                                                 | i

 25000000 50000000 125000000 175000000 275000000 325000000 425000000 575000000 725000000 775000000 | 0
(2 rows)


real    0m11.758s
user    0m0.017s
sys     0m0.008s
``
so it should be enough to observe the index speedup.

Now let's create the index. First we create a &lt;generated column&gt; that splits the strings with &lt;to_tsvector&gt;, and then we index that split column:
``
time psql tmp &lt;&lt;'EOF'
ALTER TABLE fts ADD COLUMN s_ts tsvector
  GENERATED ALWAYS AS (to_tsvector('english', s)) STORED;
EOF
time psql tmp -c 'CREATE INDEX s_ts_gin_idx ON fts USING GIN (s_ts);'
``
These commands took 8m51s and 40m8s and the DB size went up about 5x:
``
    table_name    | pg_size_pretty | pg_total_relation_size
------------------+----------------+------------------------
 fts              | 69 GB          |            74487758848
``

And finally let's try out the index:
``
time psql tmp -c "SELECT s, i FROM fts WHERE s_ts @@ to_tsquery('english', '50000000');"
``
which "instantly" gives us in 0m0.129s:
``
                                                   s                                                   | i
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---
 10000000 20000000 50000000 70000000 110000000 130000000 170000000 230000000 290000000 310000000       | 0
 25000000 50000000 125000000 175000000 275000000 325000000 425000000 575000000 725000000 775000000     | 0
 50000000 100000000 250000000 350000000 550000000 650000000 850000000 1150000000 1450000000 1550000000 | 0
``
so the index worked!

We understand from this that it only find exact word hits.

Another important use case is to search for prefixes of words, e.g. as you'd want in a simple autocompletion system. This can be achieved by adding `:*` at the end of the search term as in:
``
time psql tmp -c "SELECT s, i FROM fts WHERE s_ts @@ to_tsquery('english', '50000000:*');"
``
This finishes in the same amount of time, and gives:
``
                                                     s                                                     | i

``
so now we have cool hits such as `500000000`, `500000004`, `500000005`, `500000007` and `500000006`. The syntax is also mentioned at:
* https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-PARSING-QUERIES

Next we can also try some other queries with multiple terms. Text must contain two words with `&amp;`:
``
time psql tmp -c "SELECT s, i FROM fts WHERE s_ts @@ to_tsquery('english', '50000000 &amp; 175000000');"
``
gives:
``
                                                   s                                                   | i

``

Text can contain either word with `|`:
``
time psql tmp -c "SELECT s, i FROM fts WHERE s_ts @@ to_tsquery('english', '50000000 | 175000000');"
``
gives:

Text can contain the given words sequentially:
``
time psql tmp -c "SELECT s, i FROM fts WHERE s_ts @@ to_tsquery('english', '50000000 &lt;-&gt; 125000000 &lt;-&gt; 175000000');"

gives:

``

We can also inspect how words were split by simply doing a `SELECT *` again:
``
             s              | i |                                 s_ts

2 4 10 14 22 26 34 46 58 62 | 2 | '10':3 '14':4 '2':1 '22':5 '26':6 '34':7 '4':2 '46':8 '58':9 '62':10

``

Let's check if the index updates automatically when we do an insert and if insertion seems to have been significantly slowed down by the index:
``
time psql tmp -c "INSERT INTO fts VALUES ('abcd efgh', 99)"
``
finishes in:
``
real    0m0.043s
user    0m0.014s
sys     0m0.010s
``
so performance is OK. Presumably, the insertion time is proportional to the number of tokens, doing one logarithmic operation per token, so indexing short chunks of text like titles is easy. And then let's find it:
``
time psql tmp -c "SELECT s, i FROM fts WHERE s_ts @@ to_tsquery('english', 'efgh');"
``
which finds it with:
``
     s     | i
-----------+----
 abcd efgh | 99
``
so we are all good. Unfortunately, accurate performance benchmarking is a bit harder than that, as the index by default first collects a certain number of updates into memory into the "pending list", before actually inserting them all at once after a certain mass is reached, as documented at: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/gin.html#GIN-IMPLEMENTATION[]. We are not going that deep today.

The next thing that we need to understand is how &lt;to_tsvector&gt; #tokenizes strings for the `english` language. For example running:
``
psql -c "select to_tsvector('english', 'A Dog run runs fast faster two Cats: b c to from 1 é befhyph-afthyph.')"
``
gives:
``
'1':13
'afthyph':17
'b':9
'befhyph':16
'befhyph-afthyph':15
'c':10
'cat':8
'dog':2
'fast':5
'faster':6
'run':3,4
'two':7
'é':14
``
so we understand some of the heuristic normalizations:
* prepositions like `to` and `from` are gone. These are called stopwords as documented at: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-PARSING-DOCUMENTS[]
* words are lowercased and singularized, e.g. `Cats` becomes `cat`
* hyphenated words are stored both in separate components and in the full hyphenated form:
  * `'afthyph':17`
  * `'befhyph':16`
  * `'befhyph-afthyph':15`

The full list of languages available can be obtained with:
``
psql -c '\dF'
``
On &lt;Ubuntu 24.10&gt;, the list contains major world languages, plus the special `simple` configuration such that:
``
psql -c "select to_tsvector('simple', 'A Dog run runs fast faster two Cats: b c to from 1 é befhyph-afthyph.')"
``
gives:
``
'1':13
'a':1
'afthyph':17
'b':9
'befhyph':16
'befhyph-afthyph':15
'c':10
'cats':8
'dog':2
'fast':5
'faster':6
'from':12
'run':3
'runs':4
'to':11
'two':7
'é':14
``
so we understand that it is similar to `english` but it does not:
* seem to have any stopwords
* do singularization normalization

From the query side of things, if the query is going to be open to end users on a web interface, we need to understand `to_tsquery` better. The issue is that `to_tsquery` is quite brutal and happily throws errors for common things users might do e.g. spaces:
``
select to_tsquery('english', 'abc def');
``
giving:
``
ERROR:  syntax error in tsquery: "abc def"
``
To avoid such errors, we can use:
* `plainto_tsquery`: ANDs everything
* `websearch_to_tsquery`: supports `AND` with spaces, OR with `or`, word negation with `-word` and concatenation with `"my word"`. But it unfortunately does not support prefixing, which is what everyone and their mother wants for autocomplete: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14103880/escaping-special-characters-in-to-tsquery#comment78452351_41804957

= Create a test user in PostgreSQL
{parent=PostgreSQL}

In order to create a test user with password instead of &lt;peer authentication&gt;, let's create test user:
``
createuser -P user0
createdb user0
``
`-P` makes it prompt for the users password.

Alternatively, to create the password non-interactively https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42419559/postgres-createuser-with-password-from-terminal[]:
``
psql -c "create role NewRole with login password 'secret'"
``
Can't find a way using the `createuser` helper.

We can then login with that password with:
``
psql -U user0 -h localhost
``
which asks for the password we've just set, because the `-h` option turns off peer authentication, and turns off password authentication.

The password can be given non-interactively as shown at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6405127/how-do-i-specify-a-password-to-psql-non-interactively with the `PGPASSWORD` &lt;environment variable&gt;:
``
PGPASSWORD=a psql -U user0 -h localhost
``

Now let's create a test database which `user0` can access with an existing superuser account:
``
createdb user0db0
psql -c 'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE user0db0 TO user0'
``

We can check this permission with:
``
psql -c '\l'
``
which now contains:
``
                                  List of databases

* https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/ddl-priv.html
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25691037/postgresql-permissions-explained/25691587

`user0` can now do the usual table operations on that table:
``
PGPASSWORD=a psql -U user0 -h localhost user0db0 -c 'CREATE TABLE table0 (int0 INT, char0 CHAR(16));'
PGPASSWORD=a psql -U user0 -h localhost user0db0 -c "INSERT INTO table0 (int0, char0) VALUES (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (5, 'five'), (7, 'seven');"
PGPASSWORD=a psql -U user0 -h localhost user0db0 -c 'SELECT * FROM table0;'

= PostgreSQL serialization failure
{parent=PostgreSQL}

When using &lt;SQL REPEATABLE READ isolation level&gt; and &lt;SQL SERIALIZABLE isolation level&gt;, concurrent transactions may fail with a serialization failure, and then you might need to retry them. You server code or your ORM must always account for that.

A good way to explore when it happens is to use the example

* https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3

Includes its own copy of sqlite3, you don't use the system one, which is good to ensure compatibility. The version is shown at: https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/blob/918052b538b0effe6c4a44c74a16b2749c08a0d2/deps/common-sqlite.gypi#L3 &lt;SQLite&gt; source is tracked compressed in-tree: https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/blob/918052b538b0effe6c4a44c74a16b2749c08a0d2/deps/sqlite-autoconf-3360000.tar.gz horrendous. This explains why it takes forever to clone that repository. People who don't believe in git submodules, there's even an official Git mirror at: https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite

It appears to spawn its own &lt;threads&gt; via its &lt;C (programming language)&gt; extension (since &lt;JavaScript is single threaded&gt; and and &lt;SQLite&gt; is not &lt;server&gt;-based), which allows for parallel queries using multiple threads: https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/blob/v5.0.2/src/threading.h

`UPSERT` is extremely handy, and reduces the number of find, check on server, update loops. But `RETURNING` is a fundamental part of that (to get the updated/existing) ID.

This feature is really cool, as it allows you to keep caches up to date!

In particular, everything that happens in a trigger happens as if it were in a transaction. This way, you can do less explicit transactions when you use triggers. It is a bit like the advantages of &lt;SQL CASCADE&gt;.

TODO what is the standard compliant syntax?

&lt;PostgreSQL&gt; requires you to define a &lt;SQL stored procedure&gt;: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28149494/is-it-possible-to-create-trigger-without-execute-procedure-in-postgresql Their syntax may be standard compliant, not sure about the `EXECUTE` part. Their docs: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html

&lt;SQLite&gt; does not support &lt;SQL stored procedures&gt; at all, so maybe that's why they can't be standard compliant here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3335162/creating-stored-procedure-in-sqlite

&lt;SQL:1999&gt; 11.38 covers "Trigger definition". The &lt;Abstract syntax tree&gt; starts with the `CREATE TRIGGER` and ends in:
``
&lt;triggered SQL statement&gt; ::=
  &lt;SQL procedure statement&gt;
``

This is defined at 13.5 "SQL procedure statement", but that is humongous and I'm not sure what it is at all.

output:

union
select * from (values (2, 3), (3, 4))
EOF
``
output:
``
1|2
2|3
3|4
``

Note how duplicates are removed, to keep them we `UNION ALL` instead:
``
sqlite3 :memory: &lt;&lt;EOF
select * from (values (1, 2), (2, 3))
union all
select * from (values (2, 3), (3, 4))

Each transaction isolation level specifies what can or cannot happen when two queries are being run in parallel, i.e.: the &lt;memory semantics&gt; of the system.

Remember that queries can affects thousands of rows, and database systems like &lt;PostgreSQL&gt; can run multiple such queries at the same time.

Vs &lt;SQL SERIALIZABLE isolation level&gt; on &lt;PostgreSQL&gt;: https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/284744/postgres-repeatable-read-vs-serializable

&lt;nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_create_delete_empty_tag.js&gt;{file} is an example which experimentally seems to be solved by `REAPEATABLE READ`, although we are not sure that this is truly the case and why. What is clear is that that example is not solved by the &lt;SQL READ COMMITTED isolation level&gt;.

In &lt;PostgreSQL&gt;, this is the first isolation level which can lead to &lt;postgreSQL serialization failures&gt;, this does not happen to &lt;SQL READ COMMITTED isolation level&gt; in that &lt;DBMS&gt;. You then have to retry the transaction.

{parent=SQL parallel update example}

\a[nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_update_worker_threads.js] contains a base example that can be used to test what can happen when queries are being run in parallel. But it is broken due to a &lt;sqlite3 Node.js package&gt; bug: https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/issues/1381[]...

\a[nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_update_async.js] is an &lt;async (JavaScript)&gt; version of it. It should be just parallel enough to allow observing the same effects.

This is an example of a transaction where the &lt;SQL READ COMMITTED isolation level&gt; if sufficient.

These examples run queries of type:
``
UPDATE "MyInt" SET i = i + 1
``

Sample execution:
``
node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./parallel_update_async.js p 10 100
``
which does:
* &lt;PostgreSQL&gt;, see other databases options at &lt;SQL example&gt;
* 10 threads
* 100 increments on each thread

The fear then is that of a classic &lt;read-modify-write&gt; failure.

But as https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/transaction-iso.html page makes very clear, including with an explicit example of type `UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 12345;`, that the default isolation level, &lt;SQL READ COMMITTED isolation level&gt;, already prevents any problems with this, as the update always re-reads selected rows in case they were previously modified.
&gt; If the first updater commits, the second updater will ignore the row if the first updater deleted it, otherwise it will attempt to apply its operation to the updated version of the row

Since in &lt;PostgreSQL&gt; "Read uncommitted" appears to be effectively the same as "Read committed", we won't be able to observe any failures on that database system for this example.

&lt;nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_create_delete_empty_tag.js&gt;{file} contains an example where things can actually blow up in read committed.

= nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_select_and_update.js
{file}
{parent=SQL parallel update example}

This example is similar to &lt;nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_update_async.js&gt;{file}, but now we are doing a separate SELECT, later followed by an update:
* `SELECT FROM` to get i
* update on Js code `newI = i + 1`
* `UPDATE SET` the `newI`

Although this specific example is useless in itself, as we could just use `UPDATE "MyInt" SET i = i + 1` as in &lt;nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_update_async.js&gt;{file}, which automatically solves any concurrency issue, this kind of code could be required for example if the update was a complex function not suitably implemented in SQL, or if the update depends on some external data source.

Sample execution:
``
node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./parallel_select_and_update.js p 2 10 'READ COMMITTED'
``
which does:
* &lt;PostgreSQL&gt;, see other databases options at &lt;SQL example&gt;
* 2 threads
* 10 increments on each thread

Another one:
``
node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./parallel_select_and_update.js p 2 10 'READ COMMITTED' 'FOR UPDATE'
``
this will run &lt;SELECT FOR UPDATE&gt; rather than just &lt;SELECT (SQL)&gt;

Observed behaviour under different &lt;SQL transaction isolation levels&gt;:
* `READ COMMITTED`: fails. Nothing in this case prevents:
  * thread 1: SELECT, obtains i = 0
  * thread 2: SELECT, obtains i = 0
  * thread 2: newI = 1
  * thread 2: UPDATE i = 1
  * thread 1: newI = 1
  * thread 1: UPDATE i = 1
* `REPEATABLE READ`: works. the manual mentions that if multiple concurrent updates would happen, only the first commit succeeds, and the following ones fail and rollback and retry, therefore preventing the loss of an update.
* `READ COMMITTED` + `SELECT FOR UPDATE`: works. And does not do rollbacks, which probably makes it faster. With `p 10 100`, `REPEATABLE READ` was about 4.2s and `READ COMMITTED` + `SELECT FOR UPDATE` 3.2s on &lt;ciro santilli s hardware/Lenovo ThinkPad P51 (2017)&gt;.

  `SELECT FOR UPDATE` should be enough as mentioned at: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-ROWS
  &gt; FOR UPDATE causes the rows retrieved by the SELECT statement to be locked as though for update. This prevents them from being locked, modified or deleted by other transactions until the current transaction ends. That is, other transactions that attempt UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT FOR UPDATE, SELECT FOR NO KEY UPDATE, SELECT FOR SHARE or SELECT FOR KEY SHARE of these rows will be blocked until the current transaction ends; conversely, SELECT FOR UPDATE will wait for a concurrent transaction that has run any of those commands on the same row, and will then lock and return the updated row (or no row, if the row was deleted). Within a REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE transaction, however, an error will be thrown if a row to be locked has changed since the transaction started. For further discussion see Section 13.4.

A non-raw version of this example can be seen at: &lt;nodejs/sequelize/parallel_select_and_update.js&gt;{file}.

= nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_select_and_update_deterministic.js
{file}
{parent=SQL parallel update example}

This example contains a deterministic demo of when &lt;postgreSQL serialization failures&gt; may happen.

Tested on &lt;PostgreSQL&gt; 13.5.

= nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_create_delete_empty_tag.js
{file}
{parent=SQL parallel update example}

In this example, posts have tags. When a post is deleted, we check to see if there are now any empty tags, and now we want to delete any empty tags that the post deletion may have created.

If we are creating and deleting posts concurrently, a naive implementation might wrongly delete the tags of a newly created post.

This could be due to a concurrency issue of the following types.

Failure case 1:
* thread 2: delete old post
* thread 2: find all tags with 0 posts. Finds `tag0` from the deleted old post which is now empty.
* thread 1: create new post, which we want to have tag `tag0`
* thread 1: try to create a new tag `tag0`, but don't because it already exists, this is done using &lt;SQLite&gt;'s `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO` or &lt;PostgreSQL&gt;'s `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
* thread 1: assign `tag0` to the new post by adding an entry to the join table
* thread 2: delete all tags with 0 posts. It still sees from its previous search that `tag0` is empty, and deletes it, which then cascades into the join table
which would result in the new post incorrectly not having the `tag0`.

Failure case 2:
* thread 2: delete old post
* thread 2: find all tags with 0 posts
* thread 1: create new post
* thread 1: try to create a new tag `tag0`, but don't because it already exists
* thread 2: delete all tags with 0 posts. It still sees from its previous search that `tag0` is empty, and deletes it
* thread 1: assign `tag0` to the new post
which leads to a foreign key failure, because the tag does not exist anymore when the assignment happens.

Failure case 3:
* thread 2: delete old post
* thread 1: create new post, which we want to have tag `tag0`
* thread 1: try to create a new tag `tag0`, and succeed because it wasn't present
* thread 2: find all tags with 0 posts, finds the tag that was just created
* thread 2: delete all tags with 0 posts, deleting the new tag
* thread 1: assign `tag0` to the new post
which leads to a foreign key failure, because the tag does not exist anymore when the assignment happens.

Sample executions:
* `node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./parallel_create_delete_empty_tag.js p 9 1000 'READ COMMITTED'`: &lt;PostgreSQL&gt;, 9 tags, DELETE/CREATE the `tag0` test tag 1000 times, use `READ COMMITTED`

  Execution often fails, although not always. The failure is always:
  ``
  error: insert or update on table "PostTag" violates foreign key constraint "PostTag_tagId_fkey"
  ``
  because the:
  ``
  INSERT INTO "PostTag"
  ``
  tries to insert a tag that was deleted in the other thread, as it didn't have any corresponding posts, so this is the foreign key failure.

  TODO: we've never managed to observe the failure case in which `tag0` is deleted. Is it truly possible? And if not, by which guarantee?
* `node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./parallel_create_delete_empty_tag.js p 9 1000 'READ COMMITTED' 'FOR UPDATE'`: do a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` before trying to `INSERT`.

  This is likely correct and the fastest correct method according to our quick benchmarking, about 20% faster than `REPEATABLE READ`.

  We are just now 100% sure it is corret becase we can't find out if the `SELECT` in the `DELETE` subquery could first select some rows, which are then locked by the tag creator, and only then locked by `DELETE` after selection. Or does it re-evaludate the `SELECT` even though it is in a subquery?
* `node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./parallel_create_delete_empty_tag.js p 9 1000 'REPEATABLE READ'`: repeatable read

  We've never observed any failures with this level. This should likely fix the foreign key issue according to the PostgreSQL docs, since:
  * the `DELETE "Post"` commit cannot start to be seen only in the middle of the thread 1 transaction
  * and then if DELETE happened, the thread 1 transaction will detect it, ROLLBACK, and re-run. TODO how does it detect the need rollback? Is it because of the foreign key? It is very hard to be sure about this kind of thing, just can't find the information. Related: &lt;postgreSQL serialization failure&gt;.
* `node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./parallel_create_delete_empty_tag.js p 9 1000 'SERIALIZABLE'`: serializable
* `node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./parallel_create_delete_empty_tag.js p 9 1000 'NONE'`: magic value, don't use any transaction. Can blow up of course, since even less restrictions than `READ COMMITTED`
All executions use 2 threads.

Some theoretical notes:
* Failure case 3 is averted by a `READ COMMITTED` transaction, because thread 2 won't see the uncommitted tag that thread 1 created, and therefore won't be able to delete it
