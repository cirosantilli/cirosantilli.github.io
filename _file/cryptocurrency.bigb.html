= Are cryptocurrencies useful?
{parent=Cryptocurrency}

Cryptocurrencies have two applications:
* &lt;illegal&gt; activities, notably buying &lt;drugs&gt;, paying for &lt;ransomware&gt; and &lt;money laundering&gt;. But also paying for anti-&lt;censorship&gt; services from inside &lt;dictatorships&gt;. Illegal activity can be good when governments are bad, and arguably selling drugs should be legal.

  For this reason &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; believes that &lt;privacy coins&gt; like &lt;Monero&gt; are currently the most useful cryptocurrencies. Also, people concerned with their privacy are likely to more naturally make fewer larger payments to reduce exposure rather than a bunch of small separate ones, and therefore transaction fees matter less, and can be seen as a reasonable privacy &lt;tax&gt;. Also drugs are expensive, just have a look at any &lt;uncensored Onion service search engine&gt;, so individual transactions tend to be large.
* &lt;inflation&gt;-resistance due to &lt;money creation&gt; in &lt;fiat currencies&gt;. &lt;Money creation vs tax&gt;[Money printing is a bad form of tax]. But why not just instead invest in bonds or &lt;stocks&gt;, which actually have a specific intrinsic value and should therefore increase your capital and beat inflation? Even if crypto did take over, its value would eventually become constant, and just holding it would lose out to stocks and bonds. And pre-crypto, salaries should adjust relatively quickly to new inflation levels as they come, though there is always some delay. Also, for non-anonymous cryptocurrencies, governments will sooner or later find a way to regulate and pervert it. If you want to do things without anonymity, then what you really have to fight for is to change government itself, perhaps with a &lt;#DAO&gt;-like approach, or pushing for a more &lt;direct democracy&gt;.

The key difficulties of cryptocurrencies are:
* how do transaction fees/guarantees/times compare to centralized systems such as credit cards:
  * https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1261/is-it-possible-to-send-bitcoins-without-paying-a-fee "The Blockchain Scalability Problem &amp; the Race for Visa-Like Transaction Speed" (2019)

    &gt; The battle for a scalable solution is the blockchain's moon race. Bitcoin processes 4.6 transactions per second. Visa does around 1,700 transactions per second on average (based on a calculation derived from the official claim of over 150 million transactions per day).
  * https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44
  Obviously, decentralized currencies cannot be cheaper to maintain than centralized ones, since with decentralization you still have to send network messages at all times, and instead of one party carrying out computations, multiple parties have to carry out computations.

  Crypto could however be close enough in price to centralized systems that it becomes viable, this can be considered.
* how can &lt;governments&gt; &lt;tax&gt; cryptocurrency. Notably, because:
  * taxation has to be &lt;progressive tax&gt;[progressive], e.g. &lt;wealth tax&gt;[we have to tax the rich more than the poor], and &lt;anonymity&gt; in transactions would weaken that
  * it would be even easier to move money into &lt;fiscal paradises&gt;, and then just say, oops, lost my passwords, those coins are actually gone
  See also &lt;globalization reduces the power of governments&gt;.

If crypto really takes off, 99.99% of people will still only ever use it through some &lt;cryptocurrency exchange&gt; (unless scalability problems are solved, and they replace &lt;fiat currencies&gt; entirely), since downloading full blockchains is unfeasible, so the outcome would be very similar to &lt;PayPal&gt;, and without "true" decentralization.

For those reasons, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; instead believes that governments should issue &lt;electronic money&gt;, and maintain an open &lt;API&gt; that all can access instead. The centralized service will always be cheaper for &lt;society&gt; to maintain than any distributed service, and it will still allow for proper taxation.

Ciro believes that it is easy for people to be seduced by the &lt;idealistic&gt; promise that "cryptocurrency will make the world more fair and equal by giving everyone equal opportunities, away from the corruption of Governments". Such optimism that new &lt;technologies&gt; will solve certain key &lt;social&gt; problems without the need for constant &lt;government&gt; intervention and management is not new, as shown e.g. at &lt;HyperNormalisation by Adam Curtis (2016)&gt; when he talks about the cyberspace (when the &lt;Internet&gt; was just beginning): https://youtu.be/fh2cDKyFdyU?t=2375[]. Technologies can make our lives better. But in general, some of them also have to be managed.

In any case, cryptocurrencies are &lt;bullshit&gt;, the true currency of the future is going to be &lt;Magic: The Gathering&gt; cards. And &lt;Cirocoin&gt;.

One closely related thing that Ciro Santilli does think could be interesting exploring right now however, notably when having &lt;Monero&gt;-like anonymity in mind, would be anonymous &lt;electronic voting&gt;, which is a pre-requisite to make &lt;direct democracy&gt; convenient so people can vote more often.

TODO evaluate the possible application of cryptocurrency for international transfers:
* https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25583/does-it-make-sense-to-use-bitcoin-to-transfer-money-to-yourself-internationally
Of course, the ideal solution would be for governments to just allow for people from other countries to create accounts in their country, and use the centralized API just like citizens. Having an account of some sort is of course fundamental to avoid money laundering/tax evasion, be it on the API, or when you are going to cash out the crypto into &lt;fiat currency&gt;[fiat]. So then the question becomes: suppose that governments are shit and never make such APIs, are international transfers just because traditional banks are inefficient/greedy? Or is it because of the inevitable cost of auditing transfers? E.g. how does &lt;TransferWise&gt; compare to Bitcoin these days? And if cryptocurrency is more desirable, why wouldn't &lt;TransferWise&gt; just use it as their backend, and reach very similar fees?

Suppose we specify:
* a .dat file
* the offset in bytes within that file
The question then is, which transaction is encoded at that position of the file?

This would allow us to index inscriptions in the .dat files directly with fast C tools, and then retrive the transaction ID to get cleaner data and metadata.

It should be possible if we managed to take the information from https://bitcoindev.network/understanding-the-data/[] and dump into an indexed &lt;SQLite&gt; database.

I tried to start things off with &lt;LevelDBDumper&gt;:

= How Bitcoin works
{parent=Bitcoin}

Here is a very direct description of the system:
* each transaction (transaction is often abbreviated "tx") has a list of inputs, and a list of outputs
* each input is the output of a previous transaction. You verify your identity as the indented receiver by producing a &lt;digital signature&gt; for the &lt;public key&gt; specified on the output
* each output specifies the &lt;public key&gt; of the receiver and the value being sent
* the sum of output values cannot obvious exceed the sum of input values. If it is any less, the leftover is sent to the miner of the transaction as a transaction fee, which is an incentive for mining.
* once an output is used from an input, it becomes marked as spent, and cannot be reused again. Every input uses the selected output fully. Therefore, if you want to use an input of 1 &lt;BTC&gt; to pay 0.1 &lt;BTC&gt;, what you do is to send 0.1 &lt;BTC&gt; to the receiver, and 0.9 &lt;BTC&gt; back to yourself as &lt;change (Bitcoin)&gt;. This is why the vast majority of transactions has two outputs: one "real", and the other &lt;change (Bitcoin)&gt; back to self.
&lt;code Sample Bitcoin transaction graph&gt; illustrates these concepts:
* `tx0`: magic transaction without any inputs, i.e. either &lt;Genesis block&gt; or a coinbase &lt;Bitcoin mining reward&gt;[mining reward]. Since it is a magic transaction, it produces 3 Bitcoins from scratch: 1 in `out0` and 2 in `out1`. The initial value was actually 50 &lt;BTC&gt; and reduced with time: &lt;Bitcoin halving&gt;{full}
* `tx1`: regular transaction that takes:
  * a single input from `tx0 out0`, with value 1
  * produces two outputs:
    * `out0` for value 0.5
    * `out1` for value 0.3
  * this means that there was 0.2 left over from the input. This value will be given to the miner that mines this transaction.
  Since this is a regular transaction, no new coins are produced.
* `tx2`: regular transaction with a single input and a single output. It uses up the entire input, leading to 0 miner fees, so this greedy one might (will?) never get mined.
* `tx3`: regular transaction with two inputs and one output. The total input is 2.3, and the output is 1.8, so the miner fee will be 0.5

{title=Sample &lt;Bitcoin&gt; transaction &lt;graph&gt;}

Since every input must come from a previous output, there must be some magic way of generating new coins from scratch to bootstrap the system. This mechanism is that when the miner mines successfully, they get a mining fee, which is a magic transaction without any valid inputs and a pre-agreed value, and an incentive to use their power/compute resources to mine. This magic transaction is called a "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Coinbase[coinbase transaction]".

The key innovation of Bitcoin is how to prevent double spending, i.e. use a single output as the input of two different transactions, via mining.

For example, what prevents me from very quickly using a single output to pay two different people in quick succession?

The solution are the blocks. Blocks &lt;discretize&gt; transactions into chunks in a way that prevents double spending.

A block contains:
* a list of transactions that are valid amongst themselves. Notably, there can't be double spending within a block.

  People making transactions send them to the network, and miners select which ones they want to add to their block. Miners prefer to pick transactions that are:
  * small, as less bytes means less hashing costs. Small generally means "doesn't have a gazillion inputs/outputs".
  * have higher transaction fees, for obvious reasons
* the ID of its parent block. Blocks therefore form a linear linked list of blocks, except for temporary ties that are soon resolved. The longest known list block is considered to be the valid one.
* a nonce, which is an integer chosen "arbitrarily by the miner"

For a block to be valid, besides not containing easy to check stuff like double spending, the miner must also select a nonce such that the hash of the block starts with N zeroes.

For example, considering the transactions from &lt;code Sample Bitcoin transaction graph&gt;, the block structure shown at &lt;code Sample Bitcoin blockchain&gt; would be valid. In it `block0` contains two transactions: `tx0` and `tx1`, and `block1` also contains two transactions: `tx2` and `tx3`.

``
 block0           block1             block2
+------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
| prev:      |&lt;----prev: block0 |&lt;----prev: block1 |
+------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
| txs:       |   | txs:         |   | txs:         |
| - tx0      |   | - tx2        |   | - tx4        |
| - tx1      |   | - tx3        |   | - tx5        |
+------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
| nonce: 944 |   | nonce: 832   |   | nonce: 734   |
+------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+

``
{title=Sample &lt;Bitcoin&gt; blockchain}
The `nonce`s are on this example arbitrary chosen numbers that would lead to a desired hash for the block.

`block0` is the &lt;Genesis block&gt;, which is magic and does not have a previous block, because we have to start from somewhere. The network is hardcoded to accept that as a valid starting point.

Now suppose that the person who created `tx2` had tried to double spend and also created another transaction `tx2'` at the same time that looks like this:
``
  tx2'
+---------------+
| in0           |
| out: tx0 out1 |
+---------------+
| out0          |
| value: 2      |
+---------------+
``
Clearly, this transaction would try to spend `tx0 out1` one more time in addition to `tx2`, and should not be allowed! If this were attempted, only the following outcomes are possible:
* `block1` contains `tx2`. Then when `block2` gets made, it cannot contain `tx2'`, because `tx0 out1` was already spent by `tx2`
* `block1` contains `tx2'`. `tx2` cannot be spent anymore
Notably, it is not possible that `block1` contains both `tx2` and `tx2'`, as that would make the block invalid, and the network would not accept that block even if a miner found a `nonce`.

Since hashes are basically random, miners just have to try a bunch of nonces randomly until they find one that works.

The more zeroes, the harder it is to find the hash. For example, on the extreme case where N is all the bits of the hash output, we are trying to find a hash of exactly 0, which is statistically impossible. But if e.g. N=1, you will in average have to try only two nonces, N=2 four nonces, and so on.

The value N is updated every 2 weeks, and aims to make blocks to take 10 minutes to mine on average. N has to be increased with time, as more advanced hashing hardware has become available.

Once a miner finds a nonce that works, they send their block to the network. Other miners then verify the block, and once they do, they are highly incentivized to stop their hashing attempts, and make the new valid block be the new parent, and start over. This is because the length of the chain has already increased: they would need to mine two blocks instead of one if they didn't update to the newest block!

Therefore if you try to double spend, some random miner is going to select only one of your transactions and add it to the block.

They can't pick both, otherwise their block would be invalid, and other miners wouldn't accept is as the new longest one.

Then sooner or later, the transaction will be mined and added to the longest chain. At this point, the network will move to that newer header, and your second transaction will not be valid for any miner at all anymore, since it uses a spent output from the first one that went in. All miners will therefore drop that transaction, and it will never go in.

The goal of having this mandatory 10 minutes block interval is to make it very unlikely that two miners will mine at the exact same time, and therefore possibly each one mine one of the two double spending transactions. When ties to happen, miners randomly choose one of the valid blocks and work on top of it. The first one that does, now has a block of length L + 2 rather than L + 1, and therefore when that is propagated, everyone drops what they are doing and move to that new longest one.

They were mined on 01 Apr 2014, 02 Apr 2014 and 03 Apr 2014, suggesting a possible April fool's reference?

Each is worth 0.0002 BTC, which is only 20\$ as of 2024, so it's not worth much effort beyond the fun aspect of it. But it is fun!

Or are we missing something? The values are quite small and wouldn't be worth it the miner fees most likely. But is there a fundamental reason why this couldn't be spent by a non-standard miner?

Output 0 does:

where the large constant is an interesting &lt;inscription (blockchain)&gt; to test for the presence of &lt;XSS&gt; attacks on &lt;blockchain explorers&gt;:

This is almost spendable with:
``

but that fails because the altstack is cleared between the input and the output script, so this output is provably unspendable.

In this malformed &lt;Coinbase&gt; transaction, the mining pool "nicehash" produced a &lt;provably unspendable Bitcoin output script&gt; due to a bug, and therefore lost most of the entire &lt;block reward&gt; of 6.25 &lt;BTC&gt; then worth about \$ 123,000.

The output is unspendable because it ends in a constant 0, the disassembly of the first and main output is this series of constants:

They appear to be included, with rationale that you can already include syntactically valid crap in an unprovable way: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/320 Better then have syntactically invalid crap that is provable.

The outputs of this transaction seem to be the first syntactically incorrect scripts of the blockchain: https://blockchain.info/tx/ebc9fa1196a59e192352d76c0f6e73167046b9d37b8302b6bb6968dfd279b767?format=json[], found by parsing everything locally. The transaction was made in 2013 for 0.1 &lt;BTC&gt;, which then became unspendable.

The first invalid script is just e.g. "script":"01", which says will push one byte into the stack, but then ends prematurely.

On May 19, 2020, Lazlo announced on the &lt;Bitcoin Forum&gt; at: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195
&gt; I'll pay 10,000 &lt;Bitcoins&gt; for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day.  I like having left over pizza to nibble on later.  You can make the pizza yourself and bring it to my house or order it for me from a delivery place, but what I'm aiming for is getting food delivered in exchange for bitcoins where I don't have to order or prepare it myself, kind of like ordering a 'breakfast platter' at a hotel or something, they just bring you something to eat and you're happy!

  I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that.  I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire.

  If you're interested please let me know and we can work out a deal.
&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; remembers his father always telling him how when Ciro was small, he would try to grasp the value of money by converting it into how many pizzas he could buy. Well, at least he was not alone.

User bitcoin2paysafe then asks the fundamental practical question:
&gt; In which country do you live?
and Lazslo replies:
&gt; Jacksonville, Florida
  zip code 32224
  United States

User ender_x then points out afterward:
&gt; 10,000... Thats quite a bit.. you could sell those on https://www.bitcoinmarket.com/ for \$41 USD right now..
so it is a slightly bad deal even then!

Three days later Lazlo's asks again on the thread:
&gt; So nobody wants to buy me pizza?  Is the bitcoin amount I'm offering too low?
and one day later he confirms that the sale was made  without naming the buyer:
&gt; I just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza

  Pictures: http://heliacal.net/~solar/bitcoin/pizza/

  Thanks jercos!
where "jercos" is presumably the &lt;Bitcoin Forum&gt; username of the buyer. https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Jercos gives his identity as &lt;Jeremy Sturdivant&gt;.

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/15049566/other-bitcoin-pizza-jeremy-sturdivant-fortune-hanyecz/ mentions Jeremy sold too early however:
&gt; The cryptocash disappeared when Sturdivant used it to "cover expenses" while travelling the US with his girlfriend.

Laszlo is truly, literally, the nerd who got very very very lucky!!!

TODO &lt;Who bought Laszlo Hanyecz pizza?&gt;!!!

On June 12, 2010 Laszlo re-offers:
&gt; This is an open offer by the way.. I will trade 10,000 &lt;BTC&gt; for 2 of these pizzas any time as long as I have the funds (I usually have plenty).  If anyone is interested please let me know.  The exchange is favorable for anyone who does it because the 2 pizzas are only about 25 dollars total, maybe 30 if you give the guy a nice tip.  If you get me the upgraded extra large ones or something, I can throw in some more bitcoins, just let me know and we'll work something out.

  My 1 year old daughter really enjoys pizza too!  She just smears it all over her face if you give her a whole slice, but she does eventually manage to get most of it in her mouth (minus a few loose toppings of course).
and on August 4 user MoonShadow takes him up:
&gt; An open offer, you say?  It's been a while since you had some pizza.  Feeling a craving, Laszlo?
but finally Laszlo withdrawls the offer:
&gt; Well I didn't expect this to be so popular but I can't really afford to keep doing it since I can't generate thousands of coins a day anymore. Thanks to everyone who bought me pizza already but I'm kind of holding off on doing any more of these for now.
so we understand that the sales happened multiple times!!! Also, we understand that he was probably a miner.

TODO list all of the potential sales.

TODO who bought the Bitcoins? Is anyone else besides &lt;Jeremy Sturdivant&gt;

The original forum thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.msg1195 suggests multiple purchases were made, until he had to withdrawl the offer. Perhaps an easier question is how many pizzas he got in the first place.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/13on6px/comment/jl55025/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3 mentions without source:
&gt; I know. Laszlo Hanyecz estimates that he spent 100,000 &lt;BTC&gt; on pizza in 2010. Laszlo is the man that invented &lt;GPU&gt; mining and he mined well over 100,000 &lt;BTC&gt;.
One source is: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-man-behind-bitcoin-pizza-day-is-more-than-a-meme-hes-a-mining-pioneer

Related thread from May 2023: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5453728.msg62286606#msg62286606 "Did Laszlo Hanyecz exchange 40000 &lt;BTC&gt; for 8 pizzas, not 10000 &lt;BTC&gt; for 2 pizzas?" but their Googling is so bad no one had found the 100,000 quote before Ciro.

As per https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/113831/searching-the-blockchain-based-on-transaction-amount-and-or-date at https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/outputs?s=time(asc)&amp;q=value(1000000000000),time(2010-05-18..2010-08-05) we can list all the transactions made between the offer and withdrawal dates for value exactly 10k. There are only about 20 of them, and including someone the 22nd of May, so it is extremely likely that this will contain the hits. No repeated recipients however, so it is hard to progress with more advanced analytics tools

Some of the transactions are:
* https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/49d2adb6e476fa46d8357babf78b1b501fd39e177ac7833124b3f67b17c40c2a[49d2adb6e476fa46d8357babf78b1b501fd39e177ac7833124b3f67b17c40c2a] (22 May 2010 06:17:59 GMT+1). This one has some &lt;Google&gt; mentions:
  * https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/6c472dd00b649b18b6ca6bbcc8ba23775619ce08/appdx-pycoin.asciidoc
  * https://github.com/richardkiss/pycoin/blob/367a58e25aacf85549a7335f7607ba8a53727c81/COMMAND-LINE-TOOLS.md
  This is a highly unusual transaction from a single address https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/17WFx2GQZUmh6Up2NDNCEDk3deYomdNCfk[17WFx2GQZUmh6Up2NDNCEDk3deYomdNCfk] to a single address https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1CZDM6oTttND6WPdt3D6bydo7DYKzd9Qik[1CZDM6oTttND6WPdt3D6bydo7DYKzd9Qik] for the exact value with no &lt;change (Bitcoin)&gt;.

  By digging a bit, we see that the input comes from exactly 20 outputs, e.g. https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1E43t1VCc3Q3STKauEiUoVqLbT81XT67xj[1E43t1VCc3Q3STKauEiUoVqLbT81XT67xj], each of which is a block reward of 50 BTC, the &lt;Bitcoin halving&gt;[reward value at those early times], thus satisfactorily explaining how the exact 10k value was obtained without &lt;change (Bitcoin)&gt;. Because we know that Laszlo was a big &lt;GPU&gt; miner, it is extremelly likely that this transaction was made by him.
* https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d[a1075db55d416d3ca199f55b6084e2115b9345e16c5cf302fc80e9d5fbf5d48d] (22 May 2010 07:16:31 GMT+1) also has several &lt;Google&gt; mentions, e.g.:

Furthermore, the receiving address https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/17SkEw2md5avVNyYgj6RiXuQKNwkXaxFyQ[17SkEw2md5avVNyYgj6RiXuQKNwkXaxFyQ] is even marked as verified an as belonging to &lt;Jeremy Sturdivant&gt;.

  Furthermore this also shows us how Jeremy then transferred about half of Bitcoins 10 minutes later, but we can't know if it was to his own accounts or to cash out.

  The nature of this transaction is very different from the previous one. It uses a bunch of inputs to a single address https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1XPTgDRhN8RFnzniWCddobD9iKZatrvH4[1XPTgDRhN8RFnzniWCddobD9iKZatrvH4]. 1XPTgDRhN8RFnzniWCddobD9iKZatrvH4 contains a mixture of regular small inputs, but also a bunch of block rewards e.g. https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1MUoh2nJudSDdKu9NkcevaCG1Qe3nZHWFZ[], thus also clearly indicating Lsazlo ownership.

  The input chain is complex, but it does contain one block reward on the third level: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/17PBFeDzks3LzBTyt6bAMATNhowrvx5kBw[17PBFeDzks3LzBTyt6bAMATNhowrvx5kBw] + 79 rewards 4th level at https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/045795627ca29ec72a94c23a65ee775ea1949d60b6fba0938b75e1cfe1e6643e[045795627ca29ec72a94c23a65ee775ea1949d60b6fba0938b75e1cfe1e6643e].

Replies in November: https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2008-November/thread.html#14863 under satoshi@anonymousspeech.com claims source code shared privately by request at that point.

2011-04-23 Satoshi sent his last email ever, it was to Martti Malmi. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/business/decoding-the-enigma-of-satoshi-nakamoto-and-the-birth-of-bitcoin.html mentions:
&gt; May 2011 was also the last time Satoshi communicated privately with other Bitcoin contributors. In an email that month to Martti Malmi, one of the earliest participants, Satoshi wrote, "I've moved on to other things and probably won't be around in the future."

He or someone with the same name is having some fun with the &lt;SEC&gt;: https://dockets.justia.com/docket/florida/flmdce/8:2023cv01638/416506 for "Securities Fraud".

The complaint: https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25785.pdf[] (https://web.archive.org/web/20231218145545/https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2023/comp25785.pdf[archive]). Some pearls:
&gt; 41. Elbanna told investors several other lies to gain investors’ trust. These included his claim that he had served in the U.S. Marines, when in reality he was discharged after just fifteen days of their thirteen-week recruit training. Elbanna claimed that he had worked at the U.S. &lt;National Security Agency&gt; (“NSA”). He further claimed that the NSA was aware of and participating in the Digital World Exchange enterprise. All of these claims were false.

  42. Perhaps most incredibly, after claiming that he had “been in blockchain technology since the beginning” and “in the cryptocurrency space almost since its inception” in the May 2018 and March 2019 Whitepapers, respectively, Elbanna told investors in a chat program in April 2019 that he “was one of the first 4 creators of BTC.” He went so far as to tell another investor that he was the pseudonymous inventor of bitcoin, &lt;Satoshi Nakamoto&gt; himself. These statements were also false. Elbanna later admitted that he was not involved in blockchain technology from its beginning, and that he “didn’t even really know much about crypto” in 2018, the year he launched the Digital World Exchange enterprise.

https://www.law360.com/articles/1803299/bogus-nsa-worker-to-pay-sec-2-2m-in-crypto-scam-case says he had to pay \$2.2M to the &lt;SEC&gt;.

The documentary Bitconned from &lt;Netflix&gt; comes strongly to mind, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30317302/[]. It is unbelieveable people would fall for that kind of thing, the founders are not even sophisticated. And on top of that he agrees to appear on a documentary!!! OMG.

The mere thought that Satoshi would attempt to copyright takedown the &lt;Bitcoin whitepaper&gt;, and not be able to back his identidy with any cryptographic keys, makes one shrivel to the bones.

Also, kids, this is why you put a fucking &lt;license&gt; on everything you release to the public, and especially when doing so anonymously!!! A quick &lt;CC BY-SA&gt; on that paper would have prevented all this bullshit.

  &gt; An #Australian computer scientist who claimed he invented bitcoin lied "extensively and repeatedly" and forged documents "on a grand scale" to support his false claim, a judge at London's High Court ruled on Monday.

&gt; In 2011, Finman made a deal with his parents that he would not pursue a college degree as he wanted to make his fortune outside of traditional education.

  After receiving \$1,245 from his grandmother that year, Finman invested into Bitcoin (BTC) - which was then trading at around \$12 - and this gave him about 103 BTC.

Shame that he seems to be a &lt;American exceptionalism&gt; idiot. Perhaps it was inevitable given his circonstances. After a small market crash: https://x.com/erikfinman/status/1820457023013626322[].

&lt;Inscription (blockchain)&gt; added by &lt;Satoshi Nakamoto&gt; on the &lt;Genesis block&gt; containing:
&gt; The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks 
which is a reference to: https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chancellor-alistair-darling-on-brink-of-second-bailout-for-banks-n9l382mn62h wihch is fully titled:
&gt; Chancellor Alistair Darling on brink of second bailout for banks
The "Alistair" was slikely removed due to limited payload concerns.

Through the newspaper reference, the message proves a minimal starting date for the first mine.

And it hints that one of &lt;Bitcoin&gt;'s motivation was the &lt;financial crisis of 2007-2008&gt;, where banks were given bailouts by the government to not go under, which many people opposed as the crisis was their own fault in the first place. A notable related stab is taken at &lt;cool data embedded in the bitcoin blockchain/Len Sassaman tribute&gt;.

We can extract the image from the blockchain ourselves by starting from: https://blockchain.info/block-height/0?format=json[].

From that page we manually extract the hash `000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f` and then:
``
wget -O 0.hex https://blockchain.info/block/000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f?format=hex
xxd -p -r 0.hex
``
and that does contain the famous genesis block string:
``
EThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
``
The JSON clarifies that the data is encoded in the `script` field of the transaction `input`:
``
{
      {
         "script":"04ffff001d0104455468652054696d65732030332f4a616e2f32303039204368616e63656c6c6f72206f6e206272696e6b206f66207365636f6e64206261696c6f757420666f722062616e6b73"
``

The extra `E` (0x45 in &lt;ASCII&gt;) in `EThe Times` is just extra noise required by the script, we can break things up as:
``
04ffff001d0104 45 5468652054696d65732030332f4a616e2f32303039204368616e63656c6c6f72206f6e206272696e6b206f66207365636f6e64206261696c6f757420666f722062616e6b73
``
where:
* `54` is `T`
* the `04ffff001d0104` part just doesn't show up on the terminal because it is not made of any printable characters.

The initial `04` is `OP_RETURN`.

TODO what is actual the meaning of the `ffff001d010445` part? `@defango` https://twitter.com/defango/status/1642750851134652417 comments:
&gt; 04ffff001d0104 is a hexadecimal string. It is commonly used in the Bitcoin network as a part of the mining process. Specifically, it is used as the target value for a block to be considered valid by the Bitcoin network.

  This value represents the level of difficulty required for a miner to generate a block that meets the network's criteria. The first four bytes, 04ffff, represent the maximum possible target value. The next three bytes, 001d01, represent the current difficulty level

  while the final byte, 04, is a padding byte. In summary, this value sets the difficulty level for mining a new block in the Bitcoin network.

TODO the `output` of the transaction has a jumbled script, likely just a regular output to get things going, can't be arbitrary like input.

`awk` to skip the gazillion "mined by message" repeats.

A lot of in that website stuff appears to be cut up at the 20 mark. As shown in &lt;cool data embedded in the bitcoin blockchain/Force of Will&gt;, this is possibly because they didn't use `-w` in `strings -n20`, and the text after the newlines was less than 20 characters.

By "Satoshi uploader" we mean the data upload script present in tx https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17[4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17] of the &lt;Bitcoin blockchain&gt;.

The uploader, and its accompanying downloader, are &lt;Python&gt; programs stored in the blockchain itself. They are made to upload and download arbitrary data into the blockchain via RPC.

These scripts were notably used for: &lt;cool data embedded in the bitcoin blockchain/illegal content of block 229k&gt;. The script did not maintain its popularity much after this initial surge up loads, likely all done by the same user: there are very very few uploads done after block 229k with the Satoshi uploader.

Our choice of name as "Satoshi uploader" is copied from &lt;cool data embedded in the bitcoin blockchain/A Quantitative Analysis of the Impact of Arbitrary Blockchain Content on Bitcoin by Matzutt et al. (2018)&gt; because the scripts are Copyrighted Satoshi Nakamoto on the header comment, although as mentioned at &lt;cool data embedded in the bitcoin blockchain/Hidden surprises in the Bitcoin blockchain by Ken Shirriff (2014)&gt; this feels very unlikely to be true.

A more convenient version of those scripts that can download directly from &lt;blockchain.info&gt; without the need for a full local node can be found at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-inscription-indexer/blob/master/download_tx_consts.py by using the `--satoshi` option. E.g. with it you can download the uploader script with:
``
./download_tx_consts.py --satoshi 4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17
mv 4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17.bin uploader.py
``

The scripts can be found in the blockchain at:
* uploader: tx 4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17 block 229991 reproduced at: https://gist.github.com/cirosantilli/ade4dde7c2f2f5020d792872681763e8

  The uploader https://gist.github.com/cirosantilli/ade4dde7c2f2f5020d792872681763e8#file-bitcoin-insertion-tool-py-L161[creates a standard Pay-to-PubkeyHash transaction] with a single output and data as a fake pubkey hash, and sends change to an address specified on the command line:
  ``
  ./bitcoinInsertionTool.py &lt;data&gt; &lt;change-addr&gt;
  ``
* downloader: tx 6c53cd987119ef797d5adccd76241247988a0a5ef783572a9972e7371c5fb0cc block 229991 reproduced at https://gist.github.com/cirosantilli/e90bd2e6c3fab25a20898e61e3ab3e90

  The downloader just https://gist.github.com/shirriff/64f48fa09a61b56ffcf9#file-bitcoin-file-downloader-py-L32[strips all operands], and keeps all data, notably where public key hashes would be normally put.

The uploader script uses its own cumbersome data encoding format, which we call the "Satoshi uploader format". The is as follows:
* ignore all script operands and constants less than 20 bytes (40 hex characters). And there are a lot of small operands, e.g. the uploader itself uses format https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17 has a `OP_1`, data, `OP_3`, `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` pattern on every output script, so the `OP_1` and `OP_3` are ignored. I.e., it is &lt;P2FMS&gt;.
* ignore the last output, which contains a real change transaction instead of arbitrary data. TODO why not just do what with the length instead?
* the first 4 bytes are the payload length, the next 4 bytes a &lt;CRC-32&gt; signature. The payload length is in particular useful because of possible granularity of transactions. But it is hard to understand why a CRC-32 is needed in the middle of the largest &lt;hash tree&gt; ever created by human kind!!! It does however have the adavantage that it allows us to more uniquely identify which transactions use the format or not.
This means that if we want to index certain file types encoded in this format, a good heuristic is to skip the first 9 bytes (4 size, 4 CRC, 1 `OP_1`) and look for file signatures.

Let's try out the downloader to download itself. First you have to be running a &lt;Bitcoin Core&gt; server locally. Then, supposing `.bitcon/bitoin.conf` containing:
``
rpcuser=asdf
rpcpassword=qwer
server=1
txindex=1
``
we run:
``
git clone git://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc.git
git -C python-bitcoinrpc checkout cdf43b41f982b4f811cd4ebfbc787ab2abf5c94a
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/shirriff/64f48fa09a61b56ffcf9/raw/ad1d2e041edc0fb7ef23402e64eeb92c045b5ef7/bitcoin-file-downloader.py

``
worked! The source of the downloader script is visible! Note that we had to wait for the sync of the entire blockchain to be fully finished for some reason for that to work.

Other known uploads in Satoshi format except from the first few:
* tx 89248ecadd51ada613cf8bdf46c174c57842e51de4f99f4bbd8b8b34d3cb7792 block 344068 see &lt;ASCII art&gt;

= Daisy chain Bitcoin inscription
{parent=Bitcoin inscription method}

This is a term invented by &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt;, and refers to a loose set of uncommon &lt;Bitcoin inscription methods&gt; that involve inscribing one or a small number of payloads per &lt;Bitcoin transaction&gt;.

These methods are both inefficient and hard to detect and decode, partly because &lt;Bitcoin Core&gt; does not index spending transactions: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/61794/bitcoin-rpc-how-to-find-the-transaction-that-spends-a-txo[]. This makes finding them all that more rewarding however.

On the other hand, they do have the advantage of not depending on any block size limits, as their individual transactions are very small.

Inscribing anything large would however take a very long time, as you'd have to wait until the previous payload chunk is confirmed before going to the next one. This alone makes the format impractical perhaps.

* &lt;cool data embedded in the bitcoin blockchain/image Iranian lady with polar bear hat.&gt;

Cryptocurrency with focus on &lt;anonymity&gt;. Was almost certainly the leading &lt;privacy coin&gt; since its inception until as of writing in the 2020s.

&lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; has received and held considerable quantities of &lt;Monero&gt;, notably &lt;sponsor/1000 Monero donation&gt;. so bias alert.

As mentioned at &lt;Are cryptocurrencies useful?&gt;{full}, &lt;Ciro Santilli&gt; believes that anonymity is the most valuable feature that really matters on crypto coins, and therefore if he were to invest in crypto, he would invest in Monero or some other &lt;privacy coin&gt;.

https://localmonero.co/knowledge/monero-stealth-addresses?language=en gives an overview of the privacy mechanisms:
* &lt;ring signatures&gt;, which hide the true output (sender)

  https://localmonero.co/knowledge/ring-signatures Gives an overview. Mentions that it is prone to heuristic attacks.

  Uses a system of decoys, that adds 10 fake possible previous outputs as inputs, in addition to the actual input.

  So the network only knows/verifies that one of those 11 previous outputs was used, but it does not know which one.

  It's a bit like having a built-in &lt;cryptocurrency tumbler&gt; in every transaction.

  TODO so how do you know which previous outputs were spent or not?
* RingCT which hides the amounts.
* stealth addresses, which hides who you send to

  This forces receivers to scan try and unlock every single transaction in the chain to see if it is theirs or not.

  The sender therefore can know when the money is spent, but once again, not to whom it is being sent.

Based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoNote and like &lt;Satoshi Nakamoto&gt; created by under the pseudonym "Nicolas van Saberhagen" https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7v2obe/offering_a_bounty_for_a_video_of_the_speech_by/

&lt;Coinbase&gt; has actually stayed away from trading it even as of 2019 when Monero was the third largest market capitalization crypto because of fear of regulatory slashback: https://decrypt.co/36731/heres-why-coinbase-still-hasnt-listed-monero[]. Although it must be said, the value of privacy crypto is greatly reduced when everyone is trading it on exchanges, which require a passport upload to work.

&lt;Ubuntu&gt; 20.10 as per https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/build/ubuntu[]:
``
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake libuv1-dev libssl-dev libhwloc-dev
git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git
mkdir xmrig/build &amp;&amp; cd xmrig/build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
``
At https://minexmr.com/#getting_started we see that all you then need is a single CLI command:
``
xmrig -o pool.minexmr.com:4444 -u &lt;your-monero-address&gt;
``
Seems simple, well done devs!

Benchmark on &lt;ciro santilli s hardware/Lenovo ThinkPad P51 (2017)&gt; as per https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/benchmark[]:
``
./xmrig --bench=1M
``
gives:
``
948.1 h/s
``
which according to the https://minexmr.com &lt;mining pool&gt; would generate 0.0005 XMR/day, which at the February 2021 rate of 140 USD/XMR is 0.07 USD/day. The minimum payout in that pool is 0.004 XMR so it would take 8 days to reach that.

So clearly, &lt;application-specific integrated circuit&gt; mining is the only viable way of doing this.

Some people considering &lt;Raspberry Pis&gt; also conclude obviously that it is useless at a 10H/s rate:

= Cryptocurrency swapper
{parent=Cryptocurrency exchange}

A "Cryptocurrency swapper" is a service that swaps one type of cryptocurrency for another.

It is basically the same as buying and selling from exchanges for &lt;fiat&gt;, except that you only get fiat.

Swappers are in general able to receive send coins from any address, including self custody addresses.

Centralized swappers were a good way to workaround the endless &lt;Monero&gt; bans from exchanges circa 2024, e.g. https://x.com/cirosantilli/status/1771900725649371240 as they effectively serve as proxies for exchanges that are still legal in other countries.

They will eventually have to ban &lt;Monero&gt; of course, and then the only way left will be &lt;decentralized exchanges&gt;.

This leads to a scenario where the only effective way to ban &lt;Monero&gt; is to also ban all other cryptocurrencies. The question is if countries will go that far or not.
