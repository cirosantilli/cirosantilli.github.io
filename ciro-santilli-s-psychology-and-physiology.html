Possibly due to Ciro's partial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siesta">Spanish descent</a>?</li><li id="_6">late afternoon and evening: can do some stuff</li></ul></div></div><div class="p" id="_7">Ciro has low tolerance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation">sleep deprivation</a> which makes him very irritable, and <a href="window-blackout">low ability to sleep if there is any light</a>. It must have to do with those damned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell#Ganglion_cell_(non-rod_non-cone)_photoreceptors">ganglion cell photoreceptors</a>. On the other hand, <a href="ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-wife">Ciro Santilli's wife</a> can sleep without any problems with some morning light! It is definitely genetic. Ciro conjectures that people from very Northern parts of the world must have a gene that allows them to sleep even if there is some light, while more equatorial people don't. Maybe: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33049062/">pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33049062/</a></div><div class="p" id="_8">Ciro has mild <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia">olfactory synesthesia</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illicium_verum">star anise (八角, bajiao)</a>, which is widely used in <a href="china#chinese-cuisine">Chinese cuisine</a> and makes Ciro think uncontrollably of the color blue. Ciro does not have any other known synesthesias. He is also prone to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd_sniping">nerd sniping</a> form time to time.</div><div class="p" id="_9">Ciro is a reptilian-like being with cold hands and feet and low blood pressure. For this reason he believes that he will die of <a href="biology#cancer">cancer</a> or some respiratory problem. If the <a href="the-most-important-projects-done-by-ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china">Chinese government</a> doesn't get him first that is. This also partly explains why Ciro is not a big fan of swimming.</div><div class="p" id="_10">Besides <a href="china#chinese-food">Chinese food</a>, Ciro really likes <a href="biology#eating">eating</a> fruits and <a href="ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-cooking/roasted-nuts">roasted nuts</a>, maybe partly because he was <a href="ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-biography">born in Brazil</a>, and partly because of monkey nature, see <a href="ciro-santilli">his Chinese name</a>. At home he is known as "水果大王" (the big king of the fruits). Ciro is also a sucker for yoghurt (natural without added sugars and full fat, fat-tree yoghurt is terrible, often eaten with fruits). Ciro's "favorite drink" could be tonic water with freshly squeezed lemon. Tied with fresh fruit juices. <a href="art#chocolate">Chocolate</a>-wise, although not a huge fanatic, a Lindt <a href="art#dark-chocolate">dark chocolate</a> with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OLP0E9W">whole hazelnut pieces bar</a> will do the job.</div><div class="p" id="_11">Ciro does not like receiving or giving gifts on expected social situations like birthdays or Christmas. Ciro believes that every day is equally precious, and can be a day to give, be it through awesome <a href="software#open-source-software">open source software</a> contributions, or if you find something that your friend will like</div><div class="p" id="_12">Ciro has some respiratory allergies. When he was around 5, he had relatively serious <a href="biology#asthma">asthma</a> crisis which scared his parents to death. Throughout his life, he appears to be allergic at an intermediate level to: mold or dust mites (or whatever it is that old books/pillows have), cats (itching on touch), hay fever (in May in the UK, likely grass pollen). But even outside of hayfever season, Ciro's nose is constantly either running in the cold, or often partially blocked while sleeping throughout the year. Ciro believes however that this also gives him higher resistance to viral infections, since it has been many many years since he had a cold/flu, and when everyone in the office is going down with it, he's just fine. Ciro wonders if his active immune system will actually kill off cancers early, which he ranks as his most likely causes of death, along with respiratory and gastro-intestinal problems. Ciro has low blood pressure and cannot get fat, so cardio vascular problems seem much less likely.</div><div class="p" id="_13">Ciro is generally <a href="science#democratic-party-united-states">democrat</a> due to his high <a href="#ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-compassionate-personality">compassion level</a>. He believes that politics is highly genetically determined, and that just like you enter a room full of people and immediately like some and dislike others, the same goes for politics. People just vote for whoever they want to see more of because their way of speaking makes them feel good. There is not rationality involved in it at all.</div><div class="p" id="_14">Ciro self diagnoses a slight <a href="brain#graphomania">graphomania</a> in the early 2020's. This is largely what led him to create <a href="ourbigbook-com">OurBigBook.com</a>, and <a href="the-most-important-projects-done-by-ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions">contribute to Stack Overflow</a>. Literature Nobel Prize laureate Naguib Mahfouz <a href="https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/1529468840425422850">also suffers from the condition however</a>, so maybe good can also come out of it:<div><blockquote id="_15">If the urge to write should ever leave me, I want that day to be my last.</blockquote></div></div><div class="p" id="_16">When Ciro was quite young, maybe around 7-10, when he got very angry or sad for some stupid reason (<a href="ciro-santilli#the-bullying-of-young-ciro-santilli">bullying perhaps</a>? Ciro forgot), he would have a psychosomatic manifestation: his spine would become visibly curved sideways (scoliosis). While writing this paragraph, Ciro <a href="google">Googled</a> it, and found e.g. <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelrosen_94192/the-root-cause-of-scoliosis-5c461002b634">medium.com/@michaelrosen_94192/the-root-cause-of-scoliosis-5c461002b634</a> that describes:<div><blockquote id="_17"><div class="p" id="_18">The Root Cause of Idiopathic Scoliosis</div><div class="p" id="_19">It is proposed that Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a condition created by emotional stress. Evidence is presented that unresolved emotional stress can cause unbalanced tensions in the fascia and growing muscles that gradually deform the spinal column.</div></blockquote></div>so it is a somewhat well known thing! Incredible. Can you imagine the level of the passions that lead to such physical deformations? But of course, <a href="#effortless-effort">it was all for nothing</a>.</div><div class="toc-container" id="_toc"><ul><li class="has-child toplevel"><div class="title-div"><div class="arrow"><div></div></div><span class="not-arrow"><a class="title toc" href="#_toc"> Table of contents</a><input class="search" placeholder="🔍 Search.

Especially if they are one-off things that have no relation to anything else.</div><div class="p" id="_130">For example, Ciro never remembers which places he travelled to just once, and who was in each trip! He has images of several places he travelled to in his head, and would recognize them, but he just doesn't know where they were!</div><div class="p" id="_131">Another example, Ciro was looking at the carpet at their house, and asked where it came from. His wife replied immeidately: from Bercy shopping quarter in Paris about 10 years ago, and you took it on your back for a long walk until we could find the bus back home because we were concerned it wouldn't fit in the train!</div><div class="p" id="_132">The same goes for scenes from movies and passages from music, which explains why Ciro's <a href="art">art</a> consumption focuses on innovative <a href="calculus#discrete">discrete</a> "what happened" and "general gist" ideas, rather than, analog details such as colors and shapes.</div><div class="p" id="_133">Going back even further in time, Ciro starts to forget the less close friends he had, because the events start to fade away.</div><div class="p" id="_134">Paradoxically however, Ciro believes that this bad memory is one of his greatest strengths and key defining characteristics, because it leads Ciro to want to write down every interesting thing he learns, which motivated <a href="ourbigbook-com">OurBigBook.com</a> and his <a href="the-most-important-projects-done-by-ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions">Stack Overflow contributions</a> and his related <a href="ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-documentation-superpowers">Ciro Santilli's documentation superpowers</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_135">It also somewhat leads Ciro to like <a href="physics">physics</a> and <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, because in these fields you <a href="formalization-of-mathematics">"can deduce everything"</a> from very few base principles, so if you forget them, it does not matter that much as you can re-deduce stuff over and over. Which is somewhat where the <a href="mathematics#high-flying-bird-vs-gophers">high flying bird</a> attitude comes from. It is hard to go deep when you have to re-prove everything every time. But the upside is that anything that sticks, does so because it has a broad net to stick to, and therefore allows Ciro to make unusual and unexpected connections that others might not.</div><div class="p" id="_136">Ciro believes that there are two types of people, and most notably <a href="software#software-engineer">software engineers</a>, which are basically data wranglers: those with bad memory and those with good memory.</div><div class="p" id="_137">Those with bad memory, tend to focus on automating and improving their processes a lot. They take much longer to do one-off specific deep knowledge tasks however.</div><div class="p" id="_138">The downside of the good memory ones is that sooner or later they will find tasks that no matter how much memory they have, they cannot solve without automation, and they will fail at those.</div><div class="p" id="_139">Also, good memory people don't enable others to join the project efficiently as much.</div><div class="p" id="_140">This dichotomy also explains why Ciro sucks at code reviews, but is rather the person who runs the interesting patches by himself and finds some critical problems that the more theoretical code reviewers missed.</div><div class="p" id="_141">If Ciro <a href="ourbigbook-com#motivation">had become a scientist</a>, he would without doubt be an experimentalist, just like in this reality he is a <a href="software#gnu-debugger">GDB</a>/runtime person rather than a "static source analysis" person. Those who have bad memory prefer to just run experiments over and over and observe system state at runtime.</div><div class="p" id="_142">Other effects of having a bad memory include:<div class="list"><ul id="_143"><li id="_144">code duplication, or a constant fear of it at least, because Ciro forgets that some functionality exists already</li><li id="_145">meeting aversion, because everything that is not recorded will fade away</li><li id="_146">passion for <a href="cirism#backward-design">backward design</a>, because by the time a piece of knowledge learnt in school might be useful (and 99.99% won't), it will have been long forgotten</li></ul></div></div><div class="p" id="_147">A <a href="website#quora">Quora</a> answer! <a href="https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-benefits-of-having-a-poor-memory/answer/Ciro-Santilli">www.quora.com/Are-there-any-benefits-of-having-a-poor-memory/answer/Ciro-Santilli</a></div><div class="p" id="_148">Related: <a href="https://jakobschwichtenberg.com/about/">jakobschwichtenberg.com/about/</a> from <a href="physicist#jakob-schwichtenberg">Jakob Schwichtenberg</a>:<div><blockquote id="_149"><div class="p" id="_150">I'm a physicist and I try to write down things during my own learning process.</div><div class="p" id="_151">In some sense, one of the biggest benefits I have over other people in physics is that I'm certainly not the smartest guy!

Rather, Ciro would go to to the edges of the dance floor to have enough space for his amazing moves. There is a perhaps a parallel between such tendencies and Ciro's <a href="mathematics#high-flying-bird-vs-gophers">highly innovative personality</a>. Also perhaps being cramped would have helped wooing said girls.</div><div class="p" id="_164">Ciro later quit dancing, to a large extent because it is too hard to find suitable dancing locations outside: <a href="continent#europe">Europe</a> is too cold much of the year, also ground conditions have to be perfect, and no patience to book a dance room somewhere. Kid's playgrounds are <a href="science#idealism">ideal</a>, but Ciro is afraid of dancing there because kids parent's would freak out.</div><div class="p" id="_165">Therefore, all evidence of Cirodance seems to have disappeared into the depths of the Internet. There used to be a notorious video on YouTube from around June 2010 entitled "A Piriguete da Poli !!" ("<a href="university#university-of-sao-paulo">Poli's</a> bitch" in Portuguese) with comment "Sem comentarios... foi a atraçao da cervejada" (No comments... was the main attraction of the beer party) dancing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfrdu7i56Mg">Piriguete by MC Papo</a> Brazilian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk_carioca">Funk carioca</a> song.

But in any case, the title gives an idea of the amazing style of Ciro's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_inspiration">furor poeticus</a> Axé performance on that day. If the video owner ever reads this message, please please restore the video, or send Ciro a copy. TODO: which channel was it on? Knowing that Ciro would be able to try and contact them.</div><div class="p" id="_166">One legendary episode linked to Cirodance was when Ciro was living in <a href="continent#paris">Paris</a> and jobless around 2014 (but not destitute as he leached from his girlfriend). Cirodance was his main physical activity at the time, and <a href="continent#place-de-la-republique">Place de la République</a>, where the skateboarders hung out due to the perfect wide concrete floor and relatively close to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Bastille">Bastille</a> where Ciro lived, was the perfect place for it. One cold dark winter evening, Ciro was practicing Cirodance with his headphones and crappy clothes (dirty public square floor, remember), when someone took him for a homeless person and offered him a bowl of soup! It must be said that Place de la République had many events of giving food to the poor. Ciro was a bit stunned, declined, and continued dancing. And so that was the day when a prestigious <a href="ecole-polytechnique">Polytechnicien</a> was mistaken for a homeless person.

Ciro believes that this is because the threadmill is better amortized, and therefore does not cause the same mechanical stress required to create the itching as running on pavement.</div><div class="p" id="_227">Interestingly, Ciro didn't feel that at all when he <a href="#ciro-santilli-s-sport-practice">played soccer enthusiastically as a child</a>, and he was one of the fastest runners of the group for sure at that time.

But it is worth it.</div><div class="p" id="_234">Teams would often be slit between "the team with shirts vs the team without shirts", who would just take off their shirts.

It is a shame.</div><div class="p" id="_238">And so after that, Ciro decided to dedicate himself to sports where you can't hurt your knee.</div><div class="p" id="_239">Ciro <a href="">hates water</a>, so swimming is out of the question.

He knew nothing about bicycles, and the seat was way, way too low, the seller should be prosecuted for selling that to him. Ciro later understood that this was even a woman's bicycle with a low top tube! That's what you get for <a href="#ciro-santilli-s-cheapness">being so cheap</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_244">But then at some point he bought another <a href="ciro-santilli-s-hardware/bicycle#kross-bicycle-2017">slightly less cheap touring bicycle</a>, but this time from a much more trustworthy source: a colleague who was leaving the company and moving out, and this one was actually reasonable. It was the right size to start with!!! And so at some point, out of boredom, Ciro started to adventure out of town on weekends to neighbouring villages, and it just felt so good.</div><div class="p" id="_245">Ciro had started by taking his laptop-<a href="computer">computer</a> on his backpack, and stopping at a cafe on some nearby town where he would do some coding over the weekends. Especially during winter, <a href="ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-drug-experiences">drinking tea with a cake</a> as a break during bicycle ride was the best thing ever. In one place, there was even an electric heater that you could sit in front of. But at some point, those rides start being too short, and you start doing longer real rides without your computer. And since those take more time, you generally don't feel like staying on a far place for a very long time. So you end up creating the "real ride" category and "a small ride to get somewhere nice to code" category clearly split.</div><div class="p" id="_246">He had had the "cyclists high" version of "runner's high". A light euphoria in your head, or a pulsating feeling of pleasure in your legs and lower torso. This reminded Ciro of:<div class="list"><ul id="_247"><li id="_248">a video where a ex-<a href="biology#heroin">heroin</a> addict describes taking heroin as having an <a href="biology#orgasm">orgasm</a> in your entire body, also known as "body high"<a href="https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-a-head-high-and-a-body-high"><sup class="ref">[ref]</sup></a><a href="https://youtu.be/Fa-BktzJrWs?t=610"><sup class="ref">[ref]</sup></a>. In cycling it is mostly a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Legasm">legasm</a> though.</li><li id="_249"><a href="film#trainspotting-1996">Trainspotting (1996)</a>'s <a href="biology#orgasm">orgasm</a> scene <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUaXbM_lZj0">www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUaXbM_lZj0</a></li></ul></div>except that it is not as intense, and does not destroy your life.</div><div class="p" id="_250">Like other <a href="biology#drug">drugs</a>:<div class="list"><ul id="_251"><li id="_252">it is addictive</li><li id="_253"><div class="p" id="_254">you will have some <a href="biology#bad-trip">bad trips</a>, e.g. went the wrong way on a highway and are afraid you are going to die crushed by fast cars, got flat tire on 1 hour ride and have no repair kit, destination cafe is closed and you are hungry, wind got so strong you can barely ride, half an hour in you find out that it is way colder than what you expected.</div><div class="p" id="_255">But for every such experience you survive, you learn something to reduce the chances it will happen, and it later feels great to completely master a situation you had suffered previously with.</div><div class="p" id="_256">Ciro has also come to crave the need to go back to every bad trip spot, with better planning and circumstances, and make it feel amazing, to get the feeling that he has mastered the spot.</div></li><li id="_257">you will have hangover after a long amazing ride</li><li id="_258">the high become less intense the more you ride, and turns into something you have to do to just to feel normal. And that keeps you fit forever :)</li></ul></div></div><div class="p" id="_259">Cycling just gives you an amazing sense of freedom! Ciro likes to imagine himself as a migratory duck when he is riding his bike on cold or wet days.</div><div class="p" id="_260">The prospect of being able to reach nice new places keeps the experience fresh for a very long time.</div><div class="p" id="_261">Ciro likes to decide location on a whim on the day prior. He checks the wind to try and ride parallel to it, and then let's his mind wonder, until an image comes up, some some nice place Ciro was to once. And so the next day, he goes in that general direction again.</div><div class="p" id="_262">Each time you try to find a new cool location, and sometimes you just stumble into amazing stuff without knowing about it. Ciro likes to keep open to new experiences. Keep your eyes open, and if something looks curious, just check it out! Talking to locals for tips is also a great way to find new stuff.</div><div class="p" id="_263">One thing that Ciro often feels is rather excited on the way out, and lightly afraid of going futher at each step because of the return. And during the return, there is a greater feeling of worry and resignation, as you are more tired, you've seen what you wanted to, and you just have to get yourself homehow, often going back through paths that you know better. This reminds Ciro of the ending of the film <a href="art#in-the-realm-of-the-senses">In the Realm of the Senses (1976)</a>, in which the sex obsessed couple plays a strangling sex game, and the man says that it hurts too much when she stops strangling him, and so she strangles him to death. She also cut his <a href="biology#penis">penis</a> and carried it around in a bag afterwards, but that not relevant to the cycling analogy.</div><div class="p" id="_264">It is funny, but sometimes this gives Ciro the same feeling that he had as a child playing 2D exploration RPGs such <a href="video-game#pokemon">Pokemon</a> and <a href="video-game#final-fantasy-vi">Final Fantasy VI</a> as you explore the wild: Ciro can often hear the FF VI overworld soundtrack, or imagine that a Charmeleon is hidden just around the corner of this new towns he's never been to before. Because in the places you live and have walked a million times, you know there is no magic. But in a new place that you're visiting for the first time? Anything is possible there.</div><div class="p" id="_265">The main difference from video games is that the real world is much much more detailed and diverse, and the freedom is much more real. Also you can't just walk into any house or field like in the games, and there are more empty or repetitive areas that can sometimes get boring since they weren't hand designed. And if you die on a car crash there are no continues.</div><div class="p" id="_266">Another type of game that comes to mind are <a href="video-game#survival-game">survival games</a> and <a href="video-game#roguelike">roguelikes</a>, where it feels amazing to learn things that actually mean the difference between life and death, and conquering the environment. But also permadeath.</div><div class="p" id="_267">It also gives Ciro the magic feeling of awe that he had as a child when walking around his beloved hometown of <a href="brazil#santos-sao-paulo-brazil">Santos, São Paulo, Brazil</a> in the sunshine. And sometimes the feeling of excitement that he had as a child before getting gifts for Christmas. Ciro then once watched a <a href="website#youtube">YouTube</a> video where ex-<a href="biology#heroin">heroin</a> addicts describe the feeling of taking heroin (orally, TODO can't find the video anymore, I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa-BktzJrWs">it was this guy</a>) exactly like that: the anticipation of getting Christmas gifts, and he instantly understood.</div><div class="p" id="_268">Ciro also likes to pick random gravel from time to time. He believes that his style of route choice reflects <a href="#ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-creative-personality">Ciro Santilli's self perceived creative personality</a>: Ciro likes to go where few other people go. And he only needs to go there once to be satisfied, not master and speedrun it afterwards.</div><div class="p" id="_269">Ciro avoids riding at night of course. But when it happens and you are prepared with the safety lights and the route knowledge, it makes for some of the most memorable rides of your life.</div><div class="p" id="_270">As you start cycling, you can feel the endorphins levels rise little by little, and your mind go deeper and deeper into slumber, getting close and closer to the ground, until you reach a point where you feel like you are part of the road. <a href="film#trainspotting-1996">Trainspotting (1996)</a>'s overdose scene comes to mind: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=66&amp;v=_IDJpB9de3E">www.youtube.com/watch?t=66&amp;v=_IDJpB9de3E</a></div><div class="p" id="_271">It is amazing how you feel much less cold and hunger when cycling, to the point of being dangerous: always carry some chocolate bars in case <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFZ0aYz71Tw">you hit the wall</a>! This is especially true at the beginning of the addiction, but with increased <a href="biology#drug-tolerance">drug tolerance</a> and knowledge/awareness/preparation, this starts to feel more normal.</div><div class="p" id="_272">As a friend of Ciro once said: you start to become like a wolf, who knows every cyclable little road in a 30km radius around your home.</div><div class="p" id="_273">As of 2020, Ciro is at that "should I buy a more reasonable road bike" moment. Let's see how it goes. If he does, cycling trips with the bike on a plane are likely.</div><div class="p" id="_274">As a <a href="software#software-engineer">software engineer</a>, trying to repair a mechanical system like his bike reminds Ciro very strongly of how the <a href="technology#deep-tech">physical engineering is brutal</a>. Millimetric changes can make huge differences, it is <a href="brain#mind-blown">mind blowing</a>! Good lesson to have in mind.</div><div class="p" id="_275">Another thought that often comes to Ciro's mind is that bicycles are not regular possessions because they break a lot. Rather, they must be seen as a kind of transportation tax that you have to pay to feel amazing riding them rather than feel crappy riding a bus or train.</div><div class="p" id="_276">One interesting feeling that Ciro gets from cycling is that it is an intermediate between walking and riding a car. Ciro felt this especially strongly when he lived near work, at a distance that you could either walk or cycle. When you walk, you can just see so much more of the surroundings, it is astonishing. When you cycle, you just go much faster, and you attention is much more towards the front, so you feel surroundings much less. On the other side, cycling allows you to feel different things. E.g. in wider open areas, there isn't much detail to see anyway, so you can better feel those areas on the faster speed of the bike. A similar feeling applies to how pedestrians feel like flies when you are on a bike, just like you must feel like a fly to car drivers. Ciro later learnt that a person of similar literary ability to his, <a href="literature#ernest-hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Cycling">had a famous related similar quote</a>:<div><blockquote id="_277">It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and can coast down them.... Thus you remember them as they actually are, while in a motorcar only a high hill impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of country you have driven through as you gain by riding a bicycle.</blockquote></div></div><div class="p" id="_278">Although Ciro does not run because of his <a href="#ciro-santilli-s-legs-sometimes-itch-when-he-runs">itchy legs issue</a>, he finds it interest to contrast cycling with running, notably:<div class="list"><ul id="_279"><li id="_280">cycling has a much higher setup time or wearing appropriate clothes, unlocking your bike, and of course, <a href="#ciro-santilli-s-bicycle-wisdom">bike maintenance</a></li><li id="_281">running allows you to go into many more small paths that are not accessible by bike, thus offering a different sense of freedom.
