This is what society gets for not using <open knowledge>: some of its best minds will be bound to waste endless hours reversing some useless technology.

With that said, even when you do have the source code, reading run logs and using <debuggers> are a sort of reverse engineering at heart.

One of the most jaw dropping reverse engineering projects Ciro has ever seen is the <Super Mario 64 reverse engineering project>.

= Science is the reverse engineering of nature

How <software engineer>[software engineers] view science:
\Q[Science is the <reverse engineering> of nature.]

<Ciro Santilli> had once assigned this as one of <Ciro Santilli's best random thoughts>, but he later found that <Wikipedia> actually says exactly that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering ("similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is about a natural phenomenon") so maybe that is where Ciro picked it up unconsciously in the first place.

<Ciro Santilli> is a fan of this late 2010's buzzword.

It basically came about because of the endless stream of useless software startups made since the 2000's by one or two people with no investments with the continued increase in computers and Internet speeds <Moore's law>[until the great wall was reached].

Deep tech means not one of those. More specifically, it means technologies that require significant investment in expensive materials and laboratory equipment to progress, such as <molecular biology technologies> and <quantum computing>.

And it basically comes down to technologies that wrestle with the fundamental laws of <physics> rather than software data wrangling.

<Computers> are of course limited by the laws of physics, but those are much hidden by several layers of indirection.

Full visibility, and full control, make computer tasks be tasks that eventually always work out more or less as expected.

The same does not hold true when real Physics is involved.

Physics is brutal.

To start with, you can't even see your system very clearly, and often doing so requires altering its behaviour.

For example, in <molecular biology>, most great discoveries are made after some new technique is made to be able to observe smaller things.

But you often have to kill your cells to make those observations, which makes it very hard to understand how they work dynamically.

What we would really want would be to track every single protein as it goes about inside the cell. But that is likely an impossible dream.

The same for the brain. If we had observations of every neuron, how long would it take to understand it? Not long, people are really good at <reverse engineering> things when there is enough information available to do so, see also <science is the reverse engineering of nature>.

Then, even when you start to see the system, you might have a very hard time controlling it, because it is so fragile. This is basically the case of quantum computing in 2020.

It is for those reasons that deep tech is so exciting.

The <the next big thing>[next big things] will come from deep tech. Failure is always a possibility, and you can't know before you try.

But that's also why its so fun to dare.

Stuff that <Ciro Santilli> considers "deep tech" as of 2020:
* <brain-computer interface>{child}
* <fusion power>{child}. The question there is, when is "deep", "too deep"?

Once again, relies on <superconductivity> to reach insane magnetic fields. Superconductivity is just so important.

Yes, Sheldon he has separate American and British English versions of pages!!!
* https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tyre-sizing.html
* https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html

For example, <ciro santilli s hardware/Kross bicycle (2017)> had a Schwalbe tyre with markings:
\Q[42-622 (28 x 1.60, 700x40C)]
When inflated, the tires were about 3.5cm wide as measured with a ruler.

And the https://shop.mavic.com/en-gb/a-319-j24500.html#1028=3283&1035=3501[Mavic A319 rim] had markings:
\Q[622x19C]

In this:
* ISO (Etrto): 42-622. So:
  * 42 is the inner rim width. The actual inflated tire is going to be even wider.
  * 622 is the bead seat diameter. The actual inflated tire is going to be even wider.
* imperial: 28 x 1.60
* French: 700x40C:
  * meaning of the "C" asked at: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/16190/what-does-the-c-in-bicycle-tire-size-mean
    * https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html#french says A is larger than B which is larger than C, and C means 622 mm

* 21:00: shows inside <The Pentagon>. The way the dude who works there opens a his locked office door with an electric switch is just amazing. Cringely also mentions that there's an actual official speed limit in the corridors as he rides a carrier bike slowly through them.
* 21:45: the universities weren't enthusiastic, because people from other locations would be able to use your precious computer time. But finally <ARPA> forced the universities' hands, and they joined.
* 24:24 mentions that some of the guys who created ARPANET were actually previously counting cards at Casinos in Las Vegas, just like in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(2008_film)[21 (2008) film]
* one of the centerpieces of development was at <UCLA>. The other was the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raytheon_BBN[BBN company]. 33:55 shows the first <router>, then called them <Interface Message Processor>
* the first message was from <UCLA> to <Stanford University>. He was trying to write "Login", and it crashed at the 'g'. Epic. They later debugged it.
* towards the end talks about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALOHAnet[ALOHAnet], the first wireless computer communication done

Part 2 - Serving the Suits
* Robert Metcalfe. He's nice. <Xerox PARC>. <Ethernet>.
* Explains what is a "Workstation", notably showing one by <Sun Microsystems>. This is now an obscure "pass√©" thing in 2020 that young people like <Ciro Santilli> have only heard of in legend (or in outdated university computer labs!). Funny to think that so many people have had this idea before, including e.g. the <Chromebook>
* 10:46 mentions that all of <Cisco>, <Silicon Graphics> and <Sun Microsystems> and where founded at Margaret Jacks Hall, Building 460, at <Stanford University>.
* he then talks a lot about Sun. Sun became dominant in <Wall Street>.
* 19:05: Novell, from <Utah>. How they almost went bust, but were saved at the last moment by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Noorda[Ray Noorda], who refocused them to their NetWare product which was under recent development. It allowed file and printer sharing in <IBM PCs>. 22:55 shows how they had a live radio host for people waiting on customer support calls!
* 33:56 mentions how The Grateful Dead had in impact on the Internet, as people wanted computers to be able to access https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL[The WELL] online forum. They still own the domain as of 2022: https://www.well.com/[]. It is interesting how <Larry Page> also liked The Grateful Dead as mentioned at <The Google Story>, his dad would take him to shows. Larry is a bit younger of course than the people in this documentary.
* 37 show McAfee
* 43:56: fantastic portrait of <Cisco>

* Berners-Lee at <CERN> and the invention of the <URL>.
* 1992: <US Government> allow commerce on the <Internet>
* <Web browser> history, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)[Mosaic] and Marc Andresseeen.
* 20:45: America Online
* 23:29: <search engines> and Excite. <Google> was a bit too small to be on his radar!
* 25:50: <porn>
* 27: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motley_Fool[The Motley Fool] and advertising
* 30: Planet U grocery shopping
* 31:50: <Amazon>
* 33:00: immigrant workers, Indians playing cricket, outsourcing, Wipro Systems
* 41:25: <Java>
* 46:30: <Microsoft> joins the <Internet>. The Internet Tidal Wave Internet memo. Pearl Harbour day talk.
* 56:40: Excite Tour. If they had survived, they would have been <Google> with their quirky offices.
