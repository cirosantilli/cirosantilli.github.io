\x[ciro-santilli] is a fan of this late 2010's buzzword.

It basically came about because of the endless stream of useless software startups made since the 2000's by one or two people with no investments with the continued increase in computers and Internet speeds \x[moore-s-law][until the great wall was reached].

Deep tech means not one of those. More specifically, it means technologies that require significant investment in expensive materials and laboratory equipment to progress, such as \x[molecular-biology-technologies] and \x[quantum-computing].

And it basically comes down to technologies that wrestle with the fundamental laws of \x[physics] rather than software data wrangling.

\x[computer]{c}{p} are of course limited by the laws of physics, but those are much hidden by several layers of indirection.

Full visibility, and full control, make computer tasks be tasks that eventually always work out more or less as expected.

The same does not hold true when real Physics is involved.

Physics is brutal.

To start with, you can't even see your system very clearly, and often doing so requires altering its behaviour.

For example, in molecular biology, most great discoveries are made after some new technique is made to be able to observe smaller things.

But you often have to kill your cells to make those observations, which makes it very hard to understand how they work dynamically.

What we would really want would be to track every single protein as it goes about inside the cell. But that is likely an impossible dream.

The same for the brain. If we had observations of every neuron, how long would it take to understand it? Not long, people are really good at \x[reverse-engineering] things when there is enough information available to do so, see also \x[science-is-the-reverse-engineering-of-nature].

Then, even when you start to see the system, you might have a very hard time controlling it, because it is so fragile. This is basically the case of quantum computing in 2020.

It is for those reasons that deep tech is so exciting.

The \x[the-next-big-thing][next big things] will come from deep tech. Failure is always a possibility, and you can't know before you try.

But that's also why its so fun to dare.

Stuff that \x[ciro-santilli] considers "deep tech" as of 2020:
* \x[brain-computer-interface]{child}
* \x[fusion-power]{child}. The question there is, when is "deep", "too deep"?

Initial chapters put good clarity on the formation of the \x[military-industrial-complex]. Being backed by the military, especially just after \x[world-war-ii], was in itself enough credibility to start and foster a company.

It is funny to see how the first computers were very artisanal, made on a one-off basis.

Amazing how Control Data Corporation raised capital IPO style as a startup without a product. The dude was selling shares at dinner parties in his home.

Very interesting mention on page 70 of how \x[israel] bought CDC's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_1103[UNIVAC 1103] which Cray contributed greatly to design, and everyone knew that it was to make \x[thermonuclear-weapon]{p}, since that was what the big American labs like  this mention should be added to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Israel but that's Extended Protected... the horrors of \x[wikipedia].

Another interesting insight is how "unintegrated" computers were back then. They were literally building computers out of individual \x[vacuum-tube]{p}, then individual semiconducting transistors, a gate at a time. Then things got more and more integrated as time went. That is why the now outdated word "microprocessor" existed. When processors start to fit into a single \x[integrated-circuit], they were truly micro compared to the monstrosities that existed previously.

Also, because integration was so weak initially, it was important to more manually consider the length of wire signals had to travel, and try to put components closer together to reduce the \x[critical-path] to be able to increase clock speeds. These constraints are also of course present in modern computer design, but they were just so much more visible in those days.

The book does unfortunately not give much detail in Crays personal life as mentioned on this book review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1277733185?book_show_action=true[]. His childhood section is brief, and his wedding is described in one paragraph, and divorce in one sentence. Part of this is because he was very private about his family most likely note how Wikipedia had missed his first wedding, and likely misattribute children to the second wedding; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Seymour_Cray section "Weddings and Children".

Crays work philosophy is is highlighted many times in the book, and it is something worthy to have in mind:
* if a design is not working, start from scratch
* don't be the very first pioneer of a technology, let others work out the problems for you first, and then come second and win

Cray's final downfall was when he opted to try to use a promising but hard to work with material \x[gallium-arsenide] instead of \x[silicon] as his way to try and speed up computers, see also: \x[gallium-arsenide-vs-silicon]. Also, he went against the extremely current of the late 80's early 90's pointing rather towards using massively parallel systems based on \x[silicon] off-the-shelf \x[intel] processors, a current that had \x[darpa] support, and which by far the path that won very dramatically as of 2020, see: \x[intel-supercomputer-market-share].

Whenever \x[ciro-santilli] walks in front of a school and sees the tall gates it makes him sad. Maybe 8 year olds need gates. But do we need to protect 15 year olds like that? Students should be going out to see the world, both good and evil not hiding from it! We should instead be guiding them \i[to] the world. But instead, we are locking them up in brainwashing centers.

\x[video-the-purpose-of-education-by-noam-chomsky-2012] puts it well, education can be either be:
* a brainwashing to make people comply with The Establishment
* a way to get people genuinely interested and \x[how-to-teach/help-students-achieve-their-goal][help them to reach their life goals]

Good \x[portuguese-language] overview: http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1806-11172017000300301&lng=pt&tlng=pt

A fantastic sounding full time 4-year course that any student could transfer to called that teaches various \x[natural-science] topics, notably \x[mathematics], \x[physics], \x[chemistry] and \x[molecular-biology].

Many past students Ciro talked to however share a common frustration with the course: in the first 2 years at least, the "basic cycle", you have infinitely many courses, and no time to study, and \x[students-must-have-a-flexible-choice-of-what-to-learn][no choice of what to study], it is only in the latter 2 years (the advanced cycle) that you get the choices.

Also, if you get low grades in a single subject, your out. And \x[exams-are-useless] of course.

Here's a \x[quora] question in \x[portuguese-language] about the course: https://pt.quora.com/Como-funciona-o-tal-do-curso-secreto-da-USP[], the only decent answer so far being: https://pt.quora.com/Como-funciona-o-tal-do-curso-secreto-da-USP/answer/Victor-Soares-31[]. Very disappointing to hear.

On the advanced cycle, you have a lot of academic freedom. You are basically supposed to pick a research project with an advisor and go for it, with a small ammount of mandatory course hours. Ciro was told in 2022 that you can even have advisors from other universities or industry, and that it is perfectly feasible to take courses in another university and valiate the course hours later on. Fantastic!!!

Students from the entire \x[university-of-sao-paulo] can apply to transfer to it only after joining the university, with the guarantee that they can go back to their original courses if they don't adapt to the new course, which is great!

Not doing it is one of \x[ciro-santilli]'s regrets in life, see also: \x[don-t-be-a-pussy].

Around 2007, they were in a really shady building of the University, but when Ciro checked in 2021, they had apparently moved to a shiny new entrepreneurship-focused building. Fantastic news!!!

This place has one of the best changes of spawning the first \x[brazilian] \x[nobel-prize] or \x[unicorn-startup].

One of the \x[brazilian]{p} who came to \x[ecole-polytechnique] together with Ciro was from this course. The fact that he is one of the most intelligent people Ciro knows gave further credit to that course in his eyes.

Ciro's university experiences are mentioned at: \x[ciro-santilli-s-formal-education].

= The only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories
{parent=university}

Besides of course \x[the-main-function-of-university-is-sexual-selection][sexual selection], considering in this section only "formal learning" activities.

Consider e.g. the 2020 \x[university-of-oxford], where many many people are taking courses without any \x[laboratory] work (and also without much use at all) like literature and history, and they are paying about 9k \x[pound]{p}/year for it: \x[how-much-it-costs-to-study-at-the-university-of-oxford].

Basically all of this could be done \x[ourbigbook-com][online from books].

Laboratories are impossible however, because expendables of every experiment you do cost from hundreds to thousands of dollars, not to mention crazy upfront equipment costs.

For this reason, the brick and mortar aspect universities should focus exclusively on laboratories, and ensuring that the students with the most relevant knowledge (which can be readily obtained online) get access to those laboratories. Students should of course fully master every aspect of theory pertinent to their experiments.

Furthermore, the use of laboratories should put great focus on \x[novel-research]. A lot of laboratory instruction could be done from video of an experiments. As much as possible, we should use laboratories for novel research.

You can always learn pure theory later on for free or very cheap from books.

And above all of all, you can always learn \x[software-engineering] later on for free, because the programming community is so much more open than any other so far, notably e.g. with \x[stack-overflow] and \x[github], see also: \x[ciro-santilli-s-open-source-enlightenment]{full}. \x[ciro-santilli] is trying to change that with \x[ourbigbook-com], but don't hold your breath.

Actually, there is a good chance you will learn to program, like it or not, because chances are that you won't be able to find as decent a job doing anything else.

But there is one thing you cannot learn for free: laboratory work. Laboratory work is just \x[the-only-reason-for-universities-to-exist-should-be-the-laboratories][too expensive to carry out outside of an institution].

Basically, if you don't do laboratory work in \x[undergrad], you will very likely never be able to do so in your entire life.

Because laboratories are so rare and expensive, it is laboratories that put you in the best most unfair position at creating world changing \x[deep-tech] startups, which is why \x[when-in-doubt-choose-the-course-that-has-the-most-experimental-work]. Yes, you won't be able to achieve those insanely concentrated \x[equity]{p} of the early-\x[internet], as you will need more \x[venture-capital] to run your company, but those days are over now, deal with it.

{parent=university-of-sao-paulo}

https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/São_Remo

While in Brazil, \x[ciro-santilli] used to walk through the outskirts of a small \x[favela]{parent} to get \x[university-of-sao-paulo][to university] every day, the https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/São_Remo[Favela de São Remo].

See the street view for: https://goo.gl/maps/ZVnTjxNpsK6QPqTE9[R. Catumbi - Vila Butantã Vila Butantã, São Paulo - State of São Paulo, Brazil], e.g. https://www.google.com/maps/@-23.5611635,-46.7449982,3a,75y,77.15h,72.78t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swNEwJR0x5wkuKHvp7c0IHw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192[with this link].

To the left, the outer walls of a large police station, with \x[concertina-wire] on top and all.

To the right, dudes \x[drug-traffic][selling drugs] on the entry of a small corridor street, presumably to which they could easily escape to in case of need.

The cops could have identified the dealers with binoculars if they actually wanted to!!!

The drug sellers did keep the peace in their business area, and Ciro never got robbed, and would come back from university parties on foot late through the favela.

But Ciro's friends did say that things got much worse after Ciro left, for example http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2015/01/engenheiro-e-vitima-de-sequestro-relampago-na-cidade-universitaria.html[a flash kidnapping was reported in 2015].

Wikipedia says that this favela started in the 60s and 70s as settlements of the builders of the University, and that many of the people there still work for the University.

This is consistent with the terribly old buildings Ciro saw when he was at university. They even had the building skills to build their own homes.

The state just has to either \x[legalize] those people, or give them houses somewhere else nearby. A \x[what-poor-countries-have-to-do-to-get-richer][world class University is the most important thing a poor country can have], and its image cannot be jeopardized like that.

The existence of that favela, right next to one of the most important universities in Latin America, puts \x[brazil]'s surreal social inequality into perspective. Especially considering that before extremely heavy \x[university-entry-quotas] were added, basically all students of the university (or at least of the courses that lead to high paying jobs) had attended private schools, and therefore were not of the poorer classes (see passage about 10 out 500 passage from \x[free-gifted-education]{full}).

The janitors of the apartment block Ciro lived all lived in the favela. Yes, in poor countries lives are worth nothing, and some poorer people work by watching the entrance of buildings of less poor people 24/7 to guard it from other even more desperate poor people who might want to rob the not so poor inhabitants. They also do janitor jobs like cleaning common areas in parallel.

They were incredibly nice hard-working people, and Ciro spoke often with them. If only given the opportunity, those people could be amazing engineers or scientists obviously. Ciro was also glad to be their friends, and sat down with them quite a few times for several minutes after coming back from University parties, partly because he felt bad about them having to work at that time, but also partly because he just liked them. And they were always up to date on who had come back with a girl to the apartment or not. Ciro imagines that if it had been him, it would have been a perfect bragging opportunity ;)

They had "nothing" but were still happy. This is true wisdom, and a good reminder \x[buddhism][that all our non-\x[transhumanist] technical goals are nothing].

We must destroy \x[social-inequality].

No, they are basically \x[not-for-profit]{p}, more like what the \x[united-states] more sensibly calls "\x[private-university]{p}". But if they take government funding (directly or indirectly through subsiding enrolment fees?), they have to follow some government rules, and all major ones do it seems.
* https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/49187/in-what-sense-are-uk-universities-public/49188

A similar confusing naming pattern appears to apply to \x[public-school-united-kingdom]{p}.

In the \x[university-of-cambridge] for example, all MA degree holders or higher appear to have some voting power: https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work/governance (https://web.archive.org/web/20210811192322/https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university/how-the-university-and-colleges-work/governance[archive])

This adds an extra layer of difficulty for the average taxpayer to make changes to university policy, e.g. making universities publish all material with \x[creative-commons-license]{p}. At most, voters could require this indirectly through the government funding requisites. It is a mess.

Not even the \x[open-university] seems to be very open!

{synonym}
{title2}

As of 2022:
* https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/fees-funding/fees/rates gives study fees. Almost all courses are about 9k pounds / academic year. Courses take minimum 3 years, with an optional 4th year masters. The costs of masters can be higher however, though most aren't much.

  It is funny to note how Public Policy is comically priced at 45,890 for a course without laboratories, how can a country be so corrupt? :-) It was later brought to Ciro's attention that the reason is that those courses are not usually paid by individuals, but by their employers...

  Another eye popping one is Mathematical & Computational Finance MSc for £36,370.
* https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/fees-funding/living-costs gives living costs, an average 12k for the usual 9 month period
* there is the Crankstart scholarship: https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/student-life/help-with-the-cost/crankstart-scholarships which gives 5k/year to students whose families have less than 27k/year income, and values decrease from there to 60k/year income where they become zero.

  It is funny to note that the scholarship was previously named after a Welsh billionaire who studied there and donated and his wife, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moritz[Michael Moritz] and wife Harriet Heyman. It is actually the Welsh who are creating those scholarships for the English! It is so funny to see. His background is quite amazing, from historian to journalist to venture capitalist.

  It was later renamed Crankstart after the \x[crankstart-foundation], presumably to help gather funds from others, but it is just still led by Michael.

  It does appear that most/all of the \x[natural-science]{p} ones are reasonably priced, perhaps they are subsided.

The median household income at the time was 31khttps://web.archive.org/web/20210909201931/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2020provisional{ref}. Clearly, putting one child through university with that income would be basically impossible, you would pay 19 - 5 = 14k/year, almost half of your income. Two children would be impossible. Remember how each family needs to have two children minimum to perpetuate life?

* https://youtu.be/uol4V1Wa8B0?t=343 at the \x[university-of-bologna], the original system was for students to decide what they would learn, and hire and fire teachers as they decided. This is opposed to the system of the \x[university-of-paris], in which teachers make the final decisions.

The "most prestigious French engineering school". Only https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_École_Polytechnique_alumni#Nobel_laureates[3 Nobels] though as of 2019, the scientists are mostly at \x[ecole-normale-superieure-paris]. A https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/news/where-do-worlds-top-ceos-go-university[gazillion CEOs] ad politicians however.

\x[ciro-santilli] \x[ciro-santilli-s-formal-education][studied there] from 2010 to 2013.

Ciro considers him \x[effortless-effort][entering at Polytechnique a small miracle]. First, on his second year of \x[university-of-sao-paulo][University in Brazil], he first had to fail to join the also good but not as good https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupe_des_%C3%89coles_centrales[École centrales], which really annoyed him as he saw the "other good students" who wanted to go out get their wish. This also explains why there are so few students from his university going to Polytechnique in the late 2010's: most already went to other locations! Then, on his third year, he tried Polytechnique and got in despite feeling that the others who got in knew much more mathematics and physics than him. Rather, Ciro believes that he got in chiefly due to his \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][intense passion for the sciences] which he showed during the interview.

The miracle would have been even greater if it had happened in 2020. At this time, out of 10 \x[brazilian]{p}, 9 are from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnológico_de_Aeronáutica[ITA], the "hardest to get into" university in Brazil, and also military like Polytechnique. Make no mistake, those students are amazing and deserve it without any doubt. But there is more to the story. It could be argued that many of them only go because they don't have any other choice of exchange program. Remember: Ciro had to fail applications on previous universities before getting into Polytech. Also, they don't get any Brazilian degree because ITA has no agreements with Polytechnique, and are therefore extremely likely to never come back. \x[what-poor-countries-have-to-do-to-get-richer/exchange-students][Not that Ciro thinks this is particularly bad for Brazil though], but it does make for a better deal for France overall as well. They also happen to have closer ties across cohorts of different years, and have managed to maintain a Google Doc with scanned past examinations (as of 2020 however, http://www.brasilnax.com/material-de-preparaccedilatildeo.html[some/all of those examinations have been uploaded publicly], big kudos to them). Also almost all of them are software engineers, which is one of the few disciplines given at the relatively small ITA. This lack of diversity might not be \x[ideal]: if I were France, I would rather fish around all top Brazilian schools for "the best".

Besides the amazing funding/opportunities/alumni/staff loop which you can read about elsewhere, Polytechnique is amazing because you can \x[students-must-have-a-flexible-choice-of-what-to-learn][choose what you will study every year to a very large extent].

This is in huge contrast to the crappy systems Ciro had seen e.g. in Brazil's \x[polytechnic-school-of-the-university-of-sao-paulo], where students have to decide basically all their courses in huge packages, either at university entry (thus when they are completely clueless), or at a single point inside the university studies, changes being much harder.

Life quality was also amazing. Good free accommodation on campus and at the time a no-obligations scholarship for every foreign student great sport facilities. It seems that after Ciro left however more restrictions are added to the scholarships, what a shame! As of 2020 not everyone gets scholarships anymore it seems, mostly only loans that have to be paid back later. And those who are not poor have to pay Polytechnique scholarship fees on top of their living costs. And thus French austerity measures are undermining the greatest long term investment a country can possibly make: that of importing the very best students from other countries into yours. This after their host country has already spent 20 years raising and selecting them. And you won't even pay them 2 years of frugal existence to steal some of them them. Even if those students move away from your country later on, the contacts they made in your country mean they are much more likely to bring businesses over. But some will stay. Basically, \x[university-in-the-united-states][France is becoming more like the United States].

This also makes it much more difficult for those students to do a \x[phd] afterwards, where they would get paid very little, and are unable to pay their student debts. A PhD would be where they would possibly \x[deep-tech][bring more of the next big thing to your country]. Instead, they are much more likely to just go work for some big \x[american] company \x[software-engineer][data wrangling] and bring nothing to your country but their student debt dividends instead, which they will be pay to pay for in one year with those amazing salaries. And unsurprisingly many go to into \x[bank]{p}. What a big time fail, \x[france].

Sport was mandatory due to the military nature of the school. This did have the upside of getting students together more, although Ciro is \x[students-must-have-a-flexible-choice-of-what-to-learn][against all forms of forced intellectual of physical activities for students.] If you liked your sport it would be really cool though. But due to \x[ciro-santilli-s-knee]{full}, he was forced to give up his first beloved choice which was \x[soccer]... life can be cruel. If only Ciro had known \x[cycling] at at the time, and if only that had been one of the sports you could choose (but of course it isn't, no school will want the bad reputation of \x[restrict-the-fuck-out-of-cars][when one of their students gets killed in a car accident]).

There were also some useless "military exercises", or special situations in which you had to wear the useless school uniform as a formal "respect social clothing". \x[ciro-santilli] is completely against all that meaningless bullshit, this his just a form of theatrical masturbation to nostalgically remember the good old days of \x[napoleon] when France still ruled the world, and \x[battle-of-algiers-1966][before they tortured the Algerians]. If you are going to do military-like stuff, then at least teach students how to shoot modern rifles and modern warfare tactics (which some of the French students actually do in the pre-school mandatory internship), and not this 18th century bullshit. Ciro favours of course the hoodie-wearing, "I only care about your abilities meritocracy" culture of \x[silicon-valley]. And without the \x[political-correctness] now associated with it in the 2020s. And no shooting people if possible.

During the time Ciro was at Polytechnique in early 2010's, the school was really isolated in the Palaiseau plateau, there were no shops in 10 minute walking distance! You either had to climb 300 steps to go down to the nearest village, Lozère, or take a bus to the nearest town, Massy. The fact that https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-small-universities#survey-answer[Times Higher Education ranked it as the second best university in the world in 2019] (https://web.archive.org/web/20190918230605/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-small-universities[archive]) makes it good justice, given the small 500 student body. Things started to change a bit after Ciro left however, with the creation of the \x[polytechnic-institute-of-paris], which is bringing other schools to the Lozere area. This is for the best, as it might improve the global rankings of Polytechnique. Also it is a waste to have so few students at a technopole. But it will reduce the mystique of the place. You can't have everything in life.

Before 1976, Polytechnique was actually in the center of \x[paris] at the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Quarter,_Paris[Latin Quarter], so the Lozère mystique is not a traditional thing. But even when in Paris, students were in theory restricted to school grounds a most of the time. Although there are famous stories of a certain tree that could be used to climb the fence to go to Parisian parties when they couldn't stand it anymore. The tree was somewhat intentionally overlooked by school administrators.

This made for some good memories though. The isolation favored concentration, and gave the place a mystical feeling. And then when you went to https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/restaurants--france--paris[eat amazing Chinese food in Paris] it just felt even more special and magic since you were so limited during the week. It was also under those magical circumstances in which Ciro met \x[ciro-santilli-s-wife][his wife], another student of the school, see also: \x[the-main-function-of-university-is-sexual-selection]{full}.

Ciro also agonized about passing courses to get useless grades though! Polytechnique is hard for most Brazilians, specially if you select the more mathematics oriented courses, because the French students were math brainwashed for two years before joining.

Ciro's favorite spots/activities:
* hide in top corner desk of the library to learn some science. Ciro loves libraries.
* \x[weekend][weekend days] in his awesome room learning Chinese

  {description=The room also has a bed and toilet, it was great, and it was free back in those days! Only the kitchen was shared, which is good for meeting people. And for getting your password https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging[keylogged] in the shared supplies buying system. This actually happened while Ciro was at in Polytechnique, but the keylogger operator was caught, and the semi-secret-unknown-participants-Gestapo-like-but-mostly-head-of-school-approved student association "\x[khomiss]" broke their door (which leads to an internal corridor) with a fire axe, their traditional way of saying that someone fucked up. All students live on campus, which is great for concentration.}
* sit next to the lake in a warm day to relax

  {description=Just imagine this in a perfect sunny weekend day with pure silence, it was just perfect. The lake also has a long area where rowing is practiced.}
* randomly go study at night in one of the small 20 person classrooms that were used in the day and left open at night

In some \x[english-language] traditions, such small class system is known as \x[recitation-class]. While those small classes are a reasonable approach, \x[ciro-santilli]'s slow brain would rather just have a book and an online forum where tutors answer questions instead.}

\Image[Horny_polytechnicienne_mural_by_binet_BD_96_at_École_Polytechnique_with_nipple_censored_as_seen_in_2010.jpg]
{description=Every year, student organizations, https://www.polytechnique.net/groups/binets[called "binets"] (TODO etymology), get to compete for student elections, and they are allowed to make murals in the school to advertise themselves. They kinky people from the 1996 Cartoon Binet (BD == Band Dessiné == Cartoon in French) decided to take it to the next level. Good old 1996, this would never be allowed in 2019 due to \x[political-correctness]. As an engineering school, Polytechnique students were predominantly male up as of 2019. Let's see how much longer it will last. How about adding a sexy male polytechnician suggestively holding his theatrical sword (nicknamed the "tangente") with shirt open instead of removing the lady?}

= When the École Polytechnique mathematics department didn't let Ciro Santilli do his internship of choice due to grades
{parent=ecole-polytechnique}
{wiki}

This was one of the only bad experience Ciro had at Polytechnique, besides the inevitable fear of not graduating.

Ciro wanted to do a robotics internship in \x[germany], linked to his interests in \x[artificial-general-intelligence], see also: \x[ciro-s-2d-reinforcement-learning-games]{full}.

But the head of the \x[applied-mathematics] department Polytechnique prevented him from going because Ciro didn't have the necessary \x[grade]{p}, even though the Germans had already agreed to it: he had a C, but he needed a B. As mentioned at \x[ecole-polytechnique], most Brazilians had crappy grades due to their Polytechnique-incompatible background.

This was done because in the past students with bad grades had abandoned their internships halfway and given foreigners a bad impression of Polytechnique.

It is impossible to say if the head of department really agreed with this bullshit policy, or if it was something beyond his powers and he hid his true opinion, but it felt like the agreed.

What an extremely limited view!!!

To leave the worse, the worse. To assume that grades mean anything!

And thus Ciro had to choose a last moment internship that he hated, rather than becoming the greatest roboticist that ever lived, and did terribly at it.

At least on the other hand Ciro learnt \x[python] instead of working at the internship, and became \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions][the greatest programming tutorial writer that ever lived]. Maybe.

{parent=binet-ecole-polytechnique}
{title2="secret" École Polytechnique Binet}
{wiki}

The Khômiss was a \x[binet-ecole-polytechnique] that had 12 undisclosed participants every year.

They intentionally projected the idea of a semi scary and cool \x[secret-society]/\x[cult]/Fascist/Gestapo/non-racist Ku Klux Klan-like organization

Khômiss members would wear a face cover whenever they would go out "on duty", notably to break a student's door with a fire axe when some student had fucked up particularly bad.

The Khômiss had an ambivalent character: while on one hand they would punish students that they felt had fucked up, they were actually semi approved by the school's head.

And conversely, they could also play pranks on the school head, e.g. vandalizing their office with funny objects if they had made some decision that was particularly unpopular to the students. This also likely with tacit approval, and as a way to be a "cool independent organization that also represents the students".

As such, the Khômiss aimed to be a sort of a "conscience" of the cohort, punishing the evil deeds of either side.

They were apprently unfortunately disbanded by the school in 2013 it seems, just after \x[ciro-santilli] left. They took some poor student out by car and left him more than 1km outsie of the school for some reason. But he had a \x[cell-phone] and walked came back, so doesn't feel that serious. Likely the \x[political-correctness] of the times just caught up with them.

This is where they moved the \x[chicago-pile-1] after they decided it might be a bad idea to run \x[chicago-pile-1][highly experimental nuclear reactions] right in the middle of one of the most populous cities of the \x[united-states].

After it was reassembled, the \x[chicago-pile-1] was renamed as Chicago Pile 2 (CP2).

So more precisely, it is a continuation of the \x[metallurgical-laboratory].

It's still not that far though, only about 20 kilometers, and today is also a populated area.

\x[ciro-santilli] maintains that they chose the site because the name is so cool. Wikipedia says it is derived from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_of_Argonne[Forest of Argonne], maybe it even shared etymology with the element \x[argon].

= Exams are useless
{synonym}
{title2}

Exams are useless. Exams must be abolished. The only metrics that matter are \x[money] and fame. See also: \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation].

Once the question of an exam has been formulated, the usefulness of the problem is already been completely destroyed, because formulating the problem that matters is the most important part of things. And any problem with an answer, is useless to put effort into: \x[how-to-teach/give-answers].

Furthermore, preventing people from searching for answers while answering an exam, AKA preventing "cheating", also makes absolutely no sense. In the real world, we want people to find answers as quickly as possible! We should be teaching people how to "cheat"! What we should teach them instead is what a \x[fucking] \x[license] is, and what you have to do to comply with it.

And if you must absolutely have exams, they must be open to anyone who wants to applies. Then people have to pay to take the exam, with subsidies for "official course takers", who are spending 100x more anyways due to not living with their parents.

And if you pass the exam, you pass the course, without any further time requirements.

And those exams must be applied by professional test application companies to ensure no cheating and to factor out the anti-cheat work, while still making the tests available to people anywhere.

A quote from \x[richard-feynman] present in the book \x[surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman-chapter-o-americano-outra-vez]:
\Q[
You cannot get educated by this self-propagating system in which people study to pass exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything.

You learn something by doing it yourself, by asking questions, by thinking, and by experimenting.
]

The only metric that matters is "to feel that you've satisfied youre curiosity". When one studies for that, it can take a lot more time to actually learn everything, because it is sometimes not as clear when you should stop. But it is the only way to go deeper.

A person's understanding is the most \x[illiquid] asset that exists, to judge that based only on standardized exams, is a certain way to fail to identify top talent.

\Q[During his childhood and adolescence, Freire ended up four grades behind, and his social life revolved around playing pick-up football with other poor children, from whom he claims to have learned a great deal. These experiences would shape his concerns for the poor and would help to construct his particular educational viewpoint. Freire stated that poverty and hunger severely affected his ability to learn. These experiences influenced his decision to dedicate his life to improving the lives of the poor: "I didn't understand anything because of my hunger. I wasn't dumb. It wasn't lack of interest. My social condition didn't allow me to have an education. Experience showed me once again the relationship between social class and knowledge"]

This is a must if the people want to regain control of their society from apathetic politicians.

I would also increase voter percentage due to convenience, and reduce the weight of voting fraud cases, as everyone would be able to check that their own vote was counted correctly.

And then, we would be able to have \x[referendum]{p} for basically any important decision being made. No need to go out on the streets and waste your time in a mass protest! Just vote!

It is possible to implement anonymous electronic voting with \x[ring-signature]{p}, an algorithm also used by \x[monero], an \x[anonymity] focused \x[cryptocurrency], as mentioned e.g. on this 2004 paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/281.pdf[]. The system can be set in a way such that you can only deanonymize someone if everyone else, or a very large number of people, conspire against that person.

The same system could also be used to setup forums where only citizens of the country could comment and propose changes and vote on them.

With electronic voting, we could have a system where you can let someone you trust vote for you automatically, or vote automatically for certain subjects alone, a bit like we do by electing senators. But then you would also be able to override specific votes if you wanted to.

In this system therefore, anyone who can proxy vote has to have their vote public, and placed in a decent website that shows clearly who voted for what.

The key difficulties of cryptocurrencies are:
* how do transaction fees/guarantees/times compare to centralized systems such as credit cards:
  * https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/1261/is-it-possible-to-send-bitcoins-without-paying-a-fee "The Blockchain Scalability Problem & the Race for Visa-Like Transaction Speed" (2019)

    \Q[The battle for a scalable solution is the blockchain's moon race. Bitcoin processes 4.6 transactions per second. Visa does around 1,700 transactions per second on average (based on a calculation derived from the official claim of over 150 million transactions per day).]
  * https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44
  Obviously, decentralized currencies cannot be cheaper to maintain than centralized ones, since with decentralization you still have to send network messages at all times, and instead of one party carrying out computations, multiple parties have to carry out computations.

  Crypto could however be close enough in price to centralized systems that it becomes viable, this can be considered.
* how can \x[government]{p} \x[tax] cryptocurrency. Notably, because:
  * taxation has to be \x[progressive-tax][progressive], e.g. \x[wealth-tax][we have to tax the rich more than the poor], and \x[anonymity] in transactions would weaken that
  * it would be even easier to move money into \x[fiscal-paradise]{p}, and then just say, oops, lost my passwords, those coins are actually gone
  See also \x[globalization-reduces-the-power-of-governments].
Until those problems are solved, the only real applications of cryptocurrency will by \x[illegal] activities, notably buying \x[drug]{p}, paying for \x[ransomware]. But also paying for anti-\x[censorship] services from inside \x[dictatorship]{p}. It is for this reason that \x[ciro-santilli] believes that \x[privacy-coin]{p} are the best investments until then. People concerned with their privacy are likely to more naturally make fewer larger payments to reduce exposure, and therefore transaction fees matter less, and can be seen as a reasonable privacy \x[tax]. Also drugs are expensive, just have a look at any \x[uncensored-onion-service-search-engine], so individual transactions tend to be large.

If crypto really takes off, 99.99% of people will only ever use it through some \x[cryptocurrency-exchange] (unless scalability problems are solved, and they replace \x[fiat-currency]{p} entirely), so the experience will be very similar to \x[paypal], and without "true" decentralization.

For those reasons, \x[ciro-santilli] instead believes that governments should issue \x[electronic-money], and maintain an open \x[api] that all can access instead. The centralized service will always be cheaper for \x[society] to maintain than any distributed service, and it will still allow for proper taxation.

Ciro believes that it is easy for people to be seduced by the \x[idealistic] promise that "cryptocurrency will make the world more fair and equal by giving everyone equal opportunities, away from the corruption of Governments". Such optimism that new \x[technology]{p} will solve certain key \x[social] problems without the need for constant \x[government] intervention and management is not new, as shown e.g. at \x[hypernormalisation-by-adam-curtis-2016] when he talks about the cyberspace (when the \x[internet] was just beginning): https://youtu.be/fh2cDKyFdyU?t=2375[]. Technologies can make our lives better. But in general, some of them also have to be managed.

In any case, cryptocurrencies are \x[bullshit], the true currency of the future is going to be \x[magic-the-gathering] cards. And \x[cirocoin].

One closely related thing that Ciro Santilli does think could be interesting exploring right now however, notably when having \x[monero]-like anonymity in mind, would be anonymous \x[electronic-voting].

TODO evaluate the possible application of cryptocurrency for international transfers:
* https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25583/does-it-make-sense-to-use-bitcoin-to-transfer-money-to-yourself-internationally
Of course, the ideal solution would be for governments to just allow for people from other countries to create accounts in their country, and use the centralized API just like citizens. Having an account of some sort is of course fundamental to avoid money laundering/tax evasion, be it on the API, or when you are going to cash out the crypto into \x[fiat-currency][fiat]. So then the question becomes: suppose that governments are shit and never make such APIs, are international transfers just because traditional banks are inneficient/greedy? Or is it because of the inevitable cost of auditing transfers? E.g. how does Transferwise compare to Bitcoin these days? And if cryptocurrency is more desirable, why wouldn't Transferwise just use it as their backend, and reach very similar fees?

= How Bitcoin works
{parent=bitcoin}

Here is a very direct description of the system:
* each transaction (transaction is often abbreviated "tx") has a list of inputs, and a list of outputs
* each input is the output of a previous transaction. You verify your identity as the indented receiver by producing a \x[digital-signature] for the \x[public-key] specified on the output
* each output specifies the \x[public-key] of the receiver and the value being sent
* the sum of output values cannot obvious exceed the sum of input values. If it is any less, the leftover is sent to the miner of the transaction as a transaction fee, which is an incentive for mining.
* once an output is used from an input, it becomes marked as spent, and cannot be reused again. Every input uses the selected output fully. Therefore, if you want to use an input of 1 BTC to pay 0.1 BTC, what you do is to send 0.1 BTC to the receiver, and 0.9 BTC back to yourself as change. This is why the vast majority of transactions has two outputs: one "real", and the other change back to self.
\x[code-sample-bitcoin-transaction-graph] illustrates these concepts:
* `tx0`: magic transaction without any inputs, i.e. either \x[genesis-block] or a coinbase mining reward. Since it is a magic transaction, it produces 3 Bitcoins from scratch: 1 in `out0` and 2 in `out1`
* `tx1`: regular transaction that takes:
  * a single input from `tx0 out0`, with value 1
  * produces two outputs:
    * `out0` for value 0.5
    * `out1` for value 0.3
  * this means that there was 0.2 left over from the input. This value will be given to the miner that mines this transaction.
  Since this is a regular transaction, no new coins are produced.
* `tx2`: regular transaction with a single input and a single output. It uses up the entire input, leading to 0 miner fees, so this greedy one might (will?) never get mined.
* `tx3`: regular transaction with two inputs and one output. The total input is 2.3, and the output is 1.8, so the miner fee will be 0.5

Since every input must come from a previous output, there must be some magic way of generating new coins from scratch to bootstrap the system. This mechanism is that when the miner mines successfully, they get a mining fee, which is a magic transaction without any valid inputs and a pre-agreed value, and an incentive to use their power/compute resources to mine. This magic transaction is called a "https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Coinbase[coinbase transaction]".

The key innovation of Bitcoin is how to prevent double spending, i.e. use a single output as the input of two different transactions, via mining.

For example, what prevents me from very quickly using a single output to pay two different people in quick succession?

The solution are the blocks. Blocks \x[discretize] transactions into chunks in a way that prevents double spending.

A block contains:
* a list of transactions that are valid amongst themselves. Notably, there can't be double spending within a block.

  People making transactions send them to the network, and miners select which ones they want to add to their block. Miners prefer to pick transactions that are:
  * small, as less bytes means less hashing costs. Small generally means "doesn't have a gazillion inputs/outputs".
  * have higher transaction fees, for obvious reasons
* the ID of its parent block. Blocks therefore form a linear linked list of blocks, except for temporary ties that are soon resolved. The longest known list block is considered to be the valid one.
* a nonce, which is an integer chosen "arbitrarily by the miner"

For a block to be valid, besides not containing easy to check stuff like double spending, the miner must also select a nonce such that the hash of the block starts with N zeroes.

For example, considering the transactions from \x[code-sample-bitcoin-transaction-graph], the block structure shown at \x[code-sample-bitcoin-blockchain] would be valid. In it `block0` contains two transactions: `tx0` and `tx1`, and `block1` also contains two transactions: `tx2` and `tx3`.

``
 block0           block1             block2
+------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
| prev:      |<----prev: block0 |<----prev: block1 |
+------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
| txs:       |   | txs:         |   | txs:         |
| - tx0      |   | - tx2        |   | - tx4        |
| - tx1      |   | - tx3        |   | - tx5        |
+------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+
| nonce: 944 |   | nonce: 832   |   | nonce: 734   |
+------------+   +--------------+   +--------------+

``
{title=Sample \x[bitcoin] blockchain.}

The `nonce`s are on this example arbitrary chosen numbers that would lead to a desired hash for the block.

`block0` is the \x[genesis-block], which is magic and does not have a previous block, because we have to start from somewhere. The network is hardcoded to accept that as a valid starting point.

Now suppose that the person who created `tx2` had tried to double spend and also created another transaction `tx2'` at the same time that looks like this:
``
  tx2'
+---------------+
| in0           |
| out: tx0 out1 |
+---------------+
| out0          |
| value: 2      |
+---------------+
``
Clearly, this transaction would try to spend `tx0 out1` one more time in addition to `tx2`, and should not be allowed! If this were attempted, only the following outcomes are possible:
* `block1` contains `tx2`. Then when `block2` gets made, it cannot contain `tx2'`, because `tx0 out1` was already spent by `tx2`
* `block1` contains `tx2'`. `tx2` cannot be spent anymore
Notably, it is not possible that `block1` contains both `tx2` and `tx2'`, as that would make the block invalid, and the network would not accept that block even if a miner found a `nonce`.

Since hashes are basically random, miners just have to try a bunch of nonces randomly until they find one that works.

The more zeroes, the harder it is to find the hash. For example, on the extreme case where N is all the bits of the hash output, we are trying to find a hash of exactly 0, which is statistically impossible. But if e.g. N=1, you will in average have to try only two nonces, N=2 four nonces, and so on.

The value N is updated every 2 weeks, and aims to make blocks to take 10 minutes to mine on average. N has to be increased with time, as more advanced hashing hardware has become available.

Once a miner finds a nonce that works, they send their block to the network. Other miners then verify the block, and once they do, they are highly incentivized to stop their hashing attempts, and make the new valid block be the new parent, and start over. This is because the length of the chain has already increased: they would need to mine two blocks instead of one if they didn't update to the newest block!

Therefore if you try to double spend, some random miner is going to select only one of your transactions and add it to the block.

They can't pick both, otherwise their block would be invalid, and other miners wouldn't accept is as the new longest one.

Then sooner or later, the transaction will be mined and added to the longest chain. At this point, the network will move to that newer header, and your second transaction will not be valid for any miner at all anymore, since it uses a spent output from the first one that went in. All miners will therefore drop that transaction, and it will never go in.

The goal of having this mandatory 10 minutes block interval is to make it very unlikely that two miners will mine at the exact same time, and therefore possibly each one mine one of the two double spending transactions. When ties to happen, miners randomly choose one of the valid blocks and work on top of it. The first one that does, now has a block of length L + 2 rather than L + 1, and therefore when that is propagated, everyone drops what they are doing and move to that new longest one.

They appear to be included, with rationale that you can already include syntactically valid crap in an unprovable way: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/320 Better then have syntactically invalid crap that is provable.

The outputs of this transaction seem to be the first syntactically incorrect scripts of the blockchain: https://blockchain.info/tx/ebc9fa1196a59e192352d76c0f6e73167046b9d37b8302b6bb6968dfd279b767?format=json[], found by parsing everything locally. The transaction was made in 2013 for 0.1 BTC, which then became unspendable.

The first invalid script is just e.g. "script":"01", which says will push one byte into the stack, but then ends prematurely.

By "Satoshi uploader" we mean the data upload script present in tx https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17[4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17] of the \x[bitcoin-blockchain].

The uploader, and its accompanying downloader, are \x[python] programs stored in the blockchain itself. They are made to upload and download arbitrary data into the blockchain via RPC.

These scripts were notably used for: \x[cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/illegal-content-of-block-229k]. The script did not maintain its popularity much after this initial surge up loads, likely all done by the same user: there are very very few uploads done after block 229k with the Satoshi uploader.

Our choice of name as "Satoshi uploader" is copied from \x[cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/a-quantitative-analysis-of-the-impact-of-arbitrary-blockchain-content-on-bitcoin-by-matzutt-et-al-2018] because the scripts are Copyrighted Satoshi Nakamoto on the header comment, although as mentioned at \x[cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/hidden-surprises-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain-by-ken-shirriff-2014] this feels very unlikely to be true.

A more convenient version of those scripts that can download directly from \x[blockchain-info] without the need for a full local node can be found at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/bitcoin-strings-with-txids/blob/master/download_tx_consts.py by using the `--satoshi` option. E.g. with it you can download the uploader script with:
``
./download_tx_consts.py --satoshi 4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17

``

The scripts can be found in the blockchain at:

  The downloader just https://gist.github.com/shirriff/64f48fa09a61b56ffcf9#file-bitcoin-file-downloader-py-L32[strips all operands], and keeps all data, notably where public key hashes would be normally put.

The uploader script uses its own cumbersome data encoding format, which we call the "Satoshi uploader format". The is as follows:
* ignore all script operands and constants less than 20 bytes (40 hex characters). And there are a lot of small operands, e.g. the uploader itself uses format https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/4b72a223007eab8a951d43edc171befeabc7b5dca4213770c88e09ba5b936e17 has a `OP_1`, data, `OP_3`, `OP_CHECKMULTISIG` pattern on every output script, so the `OP_1` and `OP_3` are ignored
* ignore the last output, which contains a real change transaction instead of arbitrary data. TODO why not just do what with the length instead?
* the first 4 bytes are the payload length, the next 4 bytes a \x[crc-32] signature. The payload length is in particular useful because of possible granularity of transactions. But it is hard to understand why a CRC-32 is needed in the middle of the largest \x[hash-tree] ever created by human kind!!! It does however have the adavantage that it allows us to more uniquely identify which transactions use the format or not.
This means that if we want to index certain file types encoded in this format, a good heuristic is to skip the first 9 bytes (4 size, 4 CRC, 1 `OP_1`) and look for file signatures.

Let's try out the downloader to download itself. First you have to be running a \x[bitcoin-core] server locally. Then, supposing `.bitcon/bitoin.conf` containing:
``
rpcuser=asdf
rpcpassword=qwer
server=1

``
we run:
``
git clone git://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc.git

xxd -p -r 0.hex
``
and that does contain the famous genesis block string:
``
EThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks
``
The JSON clarifies that the data is encoded in the `script` field of the transaction `input`:
``
{
      {
         "script":"04ffff001d0104455468652054696d65732030332f4a616e2f32303039204368616e63656c6c6f72206f6e206272696e6b206f66207365636f6e64206261696c6f757420666f722062616e6b73"
``

The extra `E` (0x45 in \x[ascii]) in `EThe Times` is just extra noise required by the script, we can break things up as:
``
04ffff001d0104 45 5468652054696d65732030332f4a616e2f32303039204368616e63656c6c6f72206f6e206272696e6b206f66207365636f6e64206261696c6f757420666f722062616e6b73
``
where:
* `54` is `T`
* the `04ffff001d0104` part just doesn't show up on the terminal because it is not made of any printable characters.

The initial `04` is `OP_RETURN`

TODO what is actual the meaning of the `ffff001d010445` part?

TODO the `output` of the transaction has a jumbled script, likely just a regular output to get things going, can't be arbitrary like input.

The message proves a minimal starting date for the first mine.

And it hints that one of \x[bitcoin]'s motivation was the \x[financial-crisis-of-2007-2008], where banks were given bailouts by the government to not go under, which many people opposed as the crisis was their own fault in the first place.

Cryptocurrency with focus on \x[anonymity].

As mentioned at \x[cryptocurrency]{full}, \x[ciro-santilli] believes that anonymity is the only feature that really matters on crypto coins, and therefore if he were to invest in crypto, he would invest in Monero or some other \x[privacy-coin].

https://localmonero.co/knowledge/monero-stealth-addresses?language=en gives an overview of the privacy mechanisms:
* \x[ring-signature]{p}, which hide the true output (sender)

  https://localmonero.co/knowledge/ring-signatures Gives an overview. Mentions that it is prone to heuristic attacks.

  Uses a system of decoys, that adds 10 fake possible previous outputs as inputs, in addition to the actual input.

  So the network only knows/verifies that one of those 11 previous outputs was used, but it does not know which one.

  It's a bit like having a built-in \x[cryptocurrency-tumbler] in every transaction.

  TODO so how do you know which previous outputs were spent or not?
* RingCT which hides the amounts.
* stealth addresses, which hides who you send to

  This forces receivers to scan try and unlock every single transaction in the chain to see if it is theirs or not.

  The sender therefore can know when the money is spent, but once again, not to whom it is being sent.

Based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoNote and like \x[satoshi-nakamoto] created by under the pseudonym "Nicolas van Saberhagen" https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7v2obe/offering_a_bounty_for_a_video_of_the_speech_by/

Developers tried to fight \x[application-specific-integrated-circuit] mining, but they failed it seems:
* https://www.coindesk.com/inside-moneros-last-ditch-effort-to-block-crypto-mining-asics
* https://news.bitcoin.com/report-claims-85-of-the-monero-network-dominated-by-asic-miners/
This can also be seen by the ridiculous hash rates on Ciro's test: \x[how-to-mine-monero].

\x[coinbase] has actually stayed away from trading it even as of 2019 when Monero was the third largest market capitalization crypto because of fear of regulatory slashback: https://decrypt.co/36731/heres-why-coinbase-still-hasnt-listed-monero[]. Although it must be said, the value of privacy crypto is greatly reduced when everyone is trading it on exchanges, which require a passport upload to work.

= How to mine Monero
{parent=monero}

\x[ubuntu] 20.10 as per https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/build/ubuntu[]:
``
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake libuv1-dev libssl-dev libhwloc-dev
git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git
mkdir xmrig/build && cd xmrig/build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
``
At https://minexmr.com/#getting_started we see that all you then need is a single CLI command:
``
xmrig -o pool.minexmr.com:4444 -u <your-monero-address>
``
Seems simple, well done devs!

Benchmark on \x[ciro-santilli-s-hardware/lenovo-thinkpad-p51-2017] as per https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/benchmark[]:
``
./xmrig --bench=1M
``
gives:
``
948.1 h/s
``
which according to the https://minexmr.com \x[mining-pool] would generate 0.0005 XMR/day, which at the February 2021 rate of 140 USD/XMR is 0.07 USD/day. The minimum payout in that pool is 0.004 XMR so it would take 8 days to reach that.

So clearly, \x[application-specific-integrated-circuit] mining is the only viable way of doing this.

Some people considering \x[raspberry-pi]{p} also conclude obviously that it is useless at a 10H/s rate:

= Electronic money
{parent=digital-currency}

Our minimal definition of "electronic money" is the following.

Instead of creating \x[legal-tender] such as \x[dollar]{p} as banknotes or transactions in some complex obscure banking system, the \x[government] offers an official simple centralized API that represents it instead.

Each citizen or legal entity has an account there, and transfers between registered users are just simple API calls.

 So for example you would e able to put all your money in the government account instead of using useless banks. And then you would invest it as you want with the investment company of your choice, without tying the "my money is here" with "this is the best investment" aspects of banks.

= GNU Taler
{c}
{parent=electronic-money}

Centralized system that still attempts some level of privacy.

In it, a central bank issue tokens that are stored offline in your cell phone, a bit like cash bank notes.

When you take those tokens, a corresponding amount gets removed from your bank account, a bit like cash bank notes.

When a transaction is made, tokens are put into a spent token list via central API, and cannot be double spent thereafter. The corresponding ammount is then added to the bank account of the receiver. This also means that offline transactions are not possible.

When emitting, the bank signs the token with their private key. When spending, the bank checks that signature.

How do we prevent the bank from logging which token goes to which user besides trusting that they are running the software we whink they are running? Notably, couldn't timing be used to identify that?

Presumably the name refers to crank starting an old car, as in helping out those in difficulty like poor students get started in life. But is also an obscure slang for https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Crank%20start[a type of handjob] according to \x[urban-dictionary].

= Prize
{parent=social-technology}
{wiki}

Generally, prizes that pay big lumps of money to well established individuals are a bit useless, it would be better to pay smaller sums to struggling beginners in the field, of which there are aplenty.

The most important part about prizes should not be the money, nor the recognition, but rather explaining better what the laureates did. In this, most prizes fail. Thus \x[ciro-santilli]'s project idea: \x[project-to-explain-each-nobel-prize-better].

= Breakthrough Prize

By \x[zuckerberg]. The selection seems decent. And \x[natural-science]{p} only, which is good. A bit more application oriented than the \x[nobel-prize] it seems, e.g. 2022 separates physics and fundamental physics.

Appears to explain award reasoning even worse than the \x[nobel-foundation].

The \x[royal-society]'s \x[nobel-prize].

https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/awards/copley-medal/ says it is now open to international citizens, but having a quick look at the 2010 awards still suggests that it is very British centric, or at least anglophone centric, much like the society fellowship itself. That's likely the reason why the Nobel prize won, being much more international from the start.

E.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad[International Mathematical Olympiad], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Physics_Olympiad[International Physics Olympiad], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming[competitive programming], etc.

Events that trick young kids into thinking that they are making progress, but only serve to distract them from what really matters, which is to dominate a \x[state-of-the-art] as fast as possible, contact researches in the area, and publish truly \x[novel-result]{p}.

Financially backed by high schools trying to make ads showing how they will turn your kids into geniuses (but also passionate teachers who fell into this hellish system), or companies who hire machines rather than entrepreneurs.

The most triggering thing possible is when programming competitions don't release their benchmarks as \x[open-source-software] afterwards: at least like that they might help someone to solve their real world problems. Maybe.

On a related note, hackathons are also mostly useless. Instead of announcing a hackathon, just announce a web forum where people with similar interests can talk to one another instead, and let them code it out on \x[github] if they want to. Restricting intensive development to a few days tends to produce crappy code and not reach real goals.

Some https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artur_Avila[irrelevant people] highlight https://youtu.be/jz-41LxrI_M?t=46[that knowledge Olympiads can have good effects], because they are "an opportunity to meet university teachers and their research organizations". Ciro's argument is just that there are much more efficient ways to achieve those goals.

Life is too short for that. Companies must either notice that you can make amazing \x[open-source-software] projects or contributions, and hire you for that, or they must \x[fuck] off.

The images you have to have in mind are:

* https://cdn-0.sheldonbrown.com/images/bead-seat-diameter.jpg

Yes, Sheldon he has separate American and British English versions of pages!!!
* https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tyre-sizing.html
* https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html

For example, \x[ciro-santilli-s-hardware/kross-bicycle-2017] had a Schwalbe tyre with markings:
\Q[42-622 (28 x 1.60, 700x40C)]
When inflated, the tires were about 3.5cm wide as measured with a ruler.

And the https://shop.mavic.com/en-gb/a-319-j24500.html#1028=3283&1035=3501[Mavic A319 rim] had markings:
\Q[622x19C]

In this:
* ISO (Etrto): 42-622. So:
  * 42 is the inner rim width. The actual inflated tire is going to be even wider.
  * 622 is the bead seat diameter. The actual inflated tire is going to be even wider.
* imperial: 28 x 1.60
* French: 700x40C:
  * meaning of the "C" asked at: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/16190/what-does-the-c-in-bicycle-tire-size-mean
    * https://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html#french says A is larger than B which is larger than C, and C means 622 mm
