# Ciro Santilli's Homepage

This repository contains the [OurBigBook Markup source code](https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#ourbigbook-markup) for both:

* https://cirosantilli.com ([static website hosted on GitHub Pages](https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#p-publish))
* https://ourbigbook.com/cirosantilli ([dynamic OurBigBook Web page](https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#ourbigbook-web))

The source file of the homepage is [index.bigb](index.bigb).

You can build and view the HTML locally yourself by following the [OurBigBook CLI quick start instructions](https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#ourbigbook-cli-quick-start):

```
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io
cd cirosantilli.github.io
npm install
npx ourbigbook .
firefox _out/html/index.html
```

You can use the [issue tracker of this repository](https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/issues) for anything you want to tell me, even if it is not related to this repository. I also it as generic issue tracker for myself.
