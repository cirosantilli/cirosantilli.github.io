Sometimes it gets covered by clouds and obscured by less important things, but it always comes back again and again, weaker or stronger with its warmth, guiding Ciro's life path.</div><div class="p" id="_292">As a result, he has always suffered a lot at school: his grades were good, but he wasn't really learning those beautiful things that he wanted to learn!</div><div class="p" id="_293">School, instead of helping him, was just wasting his time with superficial knowledge.</div><div class="p" id="_294">First, before <a href="../university">university</a>, school organization had only one goal: put you into the best universities, to make a poster out of you and get publicity, so that more parents will be willing to pay them <a href="../social-technology#money">money</a> to put their kids into good university.</div><div class="p" id="_295">Ciro once asked a <a href="../chemistry">chemistry</a> teacher some "deeper question" after course was over, related to the superficial vision of the topic they were learning to get grades in university entry <a href="../education#exam">exams</a>. The teacher replied something like:<div><blockquote id="_296">You remind me of a friend of mine. He always wanted to understand the deeper reason for things. He now works at NASA.</blockquote></div>Ciro feels that this was one of the greatest compliments he has ever received in his life. This teacher, understood him. Funny how some things stick, <a href="../ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology#ciro-santilli-s-bad-old-event-memory">while all the rest fades</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_297">Another interesting anecdote is how <a href="../ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-mother">Ciro Santilli's mother</a> recalls that she always found out about exams in the same way: when the phone started ringing as Ciro's friends started asking for help with the subjects just before the exam. Sometimes it was already too hopelessly late, but Ciro almost always tried. Nothing shows how much better you are than someone than teaching them.</div><div class="p" id="_298">Then, after entering university, although things got way better because were are able to learn things that are borderline useful.</div><div class="p" id="_299">Ciro still felt a strong emotion of nostalgia when after university his mother asked if she could throw away his high school books, and Ciro started tearing them all down for recycling. Such is life.</div><div class="p" id="_300">University teachers were still to a large extent researchers who didn't want to, know how to and above all have enough time and institutional freedom to teach things properly and make you see their beauty, some good relate articles:<div class="list"><ul id="_301"><li id="_302"><a href="../physicist#the-purpose-of-harvard-is-not-to-educate-people-by-sean-carroll-2008">The Purpose of Harvard is Not to Educate People by Sean Carroll (2008)</a></li><li id="_303"><a href="../physicist#how-to-get-tenure-at-a-major-research-university-by-sean-carroll-2011">How To Get Tenure at a Major Research University by Sean Carroll (2011)</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="p" id="_304">The very fact that you had very little choice of what to learn so that a large group can get a "Diploma", makes it impossible for people to deeply learn what the really want.</div><div class="p" id="_305">This is especially true because Ciro was in <a href="../brazil">Brazil</a>, a third world country, where the opportunities are comparatively extremely limited to the <a href="../what-poor-countries-have-to-do-to-get-richer">first world</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_306">Also extremely frustrating is how you might have to wait for years to get to the subject you really want. For example, on a <a href="../physics">physics</a> course, <a href="../quantum-mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> is normally only taught on the third year! While there is value to knowing the pre-requisites, holding people back for years is just too sad, and Ciro much prefers <a href="../cirism#backward-design">backward design</a>. And just like the university entry exams, this creates an entry barrier situation where you might in the end find that "hey, that's not what I wanted to learn after all", see also: <a href="../cirism#students-must-have-a-flexible-choice-of-what-to-learn">students must have a flexible choice of what to learn</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_307">We've created a system where people just wait, and wait, and wait, never really doing what they really want. They wait through school to get into university. They wait through university to get to masters. They wait through masters to get to <a href="../education#doctor-of-philosophy">PhD</a>. They wait through <a href="../education#doctor-of-philosophy">PhD</a> to become a PI. And for the minuscule fraction of those that make it, they become fund proposal writers. And if you make any wrong choice along the, it's all over, you can't continue anymore, the cost would be too great. So you just become software engineer or a consultant. Is this the society that we really want?</div><div class="p" id="_308">And all of this is considering that he was very lucky to not be in a poor family, and was already in some of the best educational institutions locally available already, and had comparatively awesome teachers, without which he wouldn't be where he is today if he hadn't had such advantages in the first place.</div><div class="p" id="_309">But no matter how awesome one teacher is, no single person can overcome a system so large and broken. Without technological innovation that is.</div><div class="p" id="_310">The key problem all along the way is the Society's/Government's belief that everyone has to learn the same things, and that grades in exams mean anything.</div><div class="p" id="_311">Ciro believes however, that <a href="../education#exam">exams</a> are useless, and that there are only two meaningful metrics:<div class="list"><ul id="_312"><li id="_313">how much <a href="../social-technology#money">money</a> you make</li><li id="_314">fame for doing for doing useful work for society without earning money, which notably includes creating new or better free knowledge such as in <a href="../education#academic-paper">academic papers</a>, either novel or <a href="../education#review-article">review</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="p" id="_315">Even if you wanted to really learn natural sciences and had the time available, it is just too hard to find good resources to properly learn it. Even attending university courses are hit and miss between amazing and mediocre teachers.</div><div class="p" id="_316">If you go into a large book shop, the science section is tiny, and useless popular science books dominate it without <a href="../todo#videos-of-all-key-physics-experiments">precise experiment descriptions</a>. And then, the only few "serious" books are a huge list of formulas without any experimental motivation.</div><div class="p" id="_317">And if you are lucky to have access to an university library that has open doors, most books are likely to be old and boring as well. <a href="../google">Googling</a> for <a href="../computer#pdf">PDFs</a> from university courses is the best bet.</div><div class="p" id="_318">Around 2012 however, he finally saw the light, and started his path to <a href="../ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-open-source-enlightenment">Ciro Santilli's Open Source Enlightenment</a>. University was not needed anymore. He could learn whatever he wanted. A vision was born.</div><div class="p" id="_319">To make things worse, for a long time he was tired of <a href="../economy#social-inequality">seeing poor people begging on the streets every day and not doing anything about it</a>. He thought:<div><blockquote id="_320">He who teaches one thousand, saves one million.</blockquote></div>which like everything else is likely derived subconsciously from something else, here <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talmud">Schindler's list possibly adapted quote from the Talmud</a>:<div><blockquote id="_321">He who saves the life of one man saves the entire world.</blockquote></div></div><div class="p" id="_322">So, by the time he left University, instead of pursuing a PhD in theoretical Mathematics or Physics just for the beauty of it as he had once considered, he had new plans.</div><div class="p" id="_323">We needed a new educational system. One that would allow people to fulfill their potential and desires, and truly <a href="../cirism#universal-basic-income">improve society as a result</a>, both in rich and poor countries.</div><div class="p" id="_324">And he found out that programming and applied mathematics could also be fun, so he might as well have some fun while doing this! ;-)</div><div class="p" id="_325">So he started <a href="https://github.com/booktree/booktree">Booktree</a> in 2014, a <a href="../software#gitlab">GitLab</a> fork, worked on it for an year, noticed the <a href="https://github.com/booktree/booktree/blob/master/blog/2015-01-why-ciro-stopped-working-on-booktree.md">approach was dumb</a>, and a few years later started building this new version. The repo <a href="https://github.com/booktree/booktree">github.com/booktree/booktree</a> is a small snapshot of Ciro's 2014 brain on the area, there were quite a few similar projects at the time, and most have died.</div><div class="p" id="_326">Ciro is basically a librarian at heart, and wants to be the next:<div class="list"><ul id="_327"><li id="_328"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales">Jimmy Wales</a></li><li id="_329"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle">Brewster Kahle</a></li><li id="_330"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners Lee</a></li><li id="_331"><a href="../software#tim-o-reilly">Tim O'Reilly</a>, who once brilliantly described <a href="../telecommunication#o-reilly-media">O'Reilly Media</a> as "a lifestyle business that got out of control" <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/20100501/the-oracle-of-silicon-valley.html"><sup class="ref">[ref]</sup></a></li><li id="_332"><a href="../software#aaron-swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>.
