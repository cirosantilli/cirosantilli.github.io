The key is to define only the minimum number of measures: if you define more definitions become over constrained and could be inconsistent.

Learning the modern SI is also a great way to learn some interesting Physics.

TODO how does basing it on the \x[elementary-charge] help at all? Can we count individual electrons going through a wire? https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/ampere/ampere-quantum-metrology-triangle by the \x[nist] explains that is it basically due to the following two \x[quantized-physics] \x[solid-state-physics] phenomena/experiments that allows for extremely precise measurements of the \x[elementary-charge]:
* \x[quantum-hall-effect], which has \x[discrete] \x[electrical-resistance][resistances] of type:
  $$
  R_{xy} = \frac{V_\text{Hall}}{I_\text{channel}} = \frac{h}{e^2\nu}
  $$
  for integer values of $\nu$.
* \x[josephson-effect], which provides the \x[josephson-constant] which equals:
  $$
  K_{J} = \frac{2e}{h}
  $$

Unit of \x[electric-current].

Unit of \x[mass].

Defined in the \x[2019-redefinition-of-the-si-base-units] via the \x[planck-constant]. This was possible due to the development of the \x[kibble-balance].

{title=How an atomic clock works, and its use in the global positioning system (GPS) by \x[engineerguy] (2012)}
{description=Shows how conceptually an atomic clock is based on a \x[feedback-loop] of two \x[hyperfine-structure] states of \x[caesium] atoms (non-\x[radioactive] \x[caesium-133] as clarified by the \x[wikipedia] page). Like a \x[quartz-clock], it also relies on the \x[piezoelectricity] of quartz, but unlike the \x[quartz-clock], the \x[quartz] is not shaped like a \x[tuning-fork], and has a much larger ressonating frequency of about 7 \x[mhz]. The feedback is completed by producing \x[photon]{p} that \x[resonate] at the right frequency to excite the \x[caesium].}

Uses the \x[frequency] of the \x[hyperfine-structure] of \x[caesium-133] ground state ($6s^1$) to define the \x[second].

\x[international-system-of-units] definition os the second since 1967, because this is what \x[atomic-clock]{p} use.
