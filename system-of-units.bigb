The key is to define only the minimum number of measures: if you define more definitions become over constrained and could be inconsistent.

Learning the modern SI is also a great way to learn some interesting Physics.

TODO how does basing it on the <elementary charge> help at all? Can we count individual electrons going through a wire? https://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/ampere/ampere-quantum-metrology-triangle by the <NIST> explains that is it basically due to the following two <quantized (physics)> <solid-state physics> phenomena/experiments that allows for extremely precise measurements of the <elementary charge>:
* <quantum Hall effect>, which has <discrete> <electrical resistance>[resistances] of type:
  $$
  R_{xy} = \frac{V_\text{Hall}}{I_\text{channel}} = \frac{h}{e^2\nu}
  $$
  for integer values of $\nu$.
* <Josephson effect>, which provides the <Josephson constant> which equals:
  $$
  K_{J} = \frac{2e}{h}
  $$

Defined in the <2019 redefinition of the SI base units> via the <Planck constant>. This was possible due to the development of the <kibble balance>.

{title=How an atomic clock works, and its use in the global positioning system (GPS) by <EngineerGuy> (2012)}
{description=Shows how conceptually an atomic clock is based on a <feedback loop> of two <hyperfine structure> states of <caesium> atoms (non-<radioactive> <caesium-133> as clarified by the <Wikipedia> page). Like a <quartz clock>, it also relies on the <piezoelectricity> of quartz, but unlike the <quartz clock>, the <quartz> is not shaped like a <tuning fork>, and has a much larger resonating frequency of about 7 <MHz>. The feedback is completed by producing <photons> that <resonate> at the right frequency to excite the <caesium>.}

{description=
A similar model was used in the <Hafele-Keating experiment> to test <special relativity> on two planes flying in opposite directions. Miniaturization was key.

Contains a disposable tube with 6g of <Caesium>. You boil it, so when it runs out, you change the tube, 40k USD. Their tube is made by <Agilent Technologies>, so a replacement since that opened in 1999, and the original machine is from the 60s.

Detection is done with an <electron multiplier>.

Uses the <frequency> of the <hyperfine structure> of <caesium-133> ground state, i.e spin up vs spin down of its valence electron $6s^1$, to define the <second>.

<International System of Units> definition of the second since 1967, because this is what <atomic clocks> use.
