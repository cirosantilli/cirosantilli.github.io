Update list:
* https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/256138/is-there-any-decent-speech-recognition-software-for-linux/613392#613392 cool to see that the Vosk open source speech recognition software by https://twitter.com/alphacep now has a convenient command line interface called vosk-transcriber! 

  It allows you to just:

  ``
  vosk-transcriber -m ~/var/lib/vosk/vosk-model-en-us-0.22 -i in.ogg -o out.srt -t srt
  ``

  to extract a subtitle file out.srt from a .ogg audio input file.

  Accuracy is a bit meh, but we'll take it!

* Just found out that <Ciro Santilli's hardware/P14s>[my Lenovo ThinkPad P14s] has an infrared camera, and recorded a quick test video on <Ubuntu 23.10> with:
  ``
  fmpeg -y -f v4l2 -framerate 30 -video_size 640x360 -input_format gray -i /dev/video2 -c copy out.mkv
