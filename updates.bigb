= duty-machine news on china-dictatorship issues
{parent=Updates}
{tag=China dictatorship}

Whenever a user creates an issue or comment on <China Dictatorship>, the bot now automatically creates a new issue with one of the latest news from Duty Machine: https://github.com/duty-machine/duty-machine

Sample created issue: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/1322 Script: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/ab6a46c511afaaf6c9e68ba8813c2b2cf9d9638c/action.js#L195

Duty Machine is a bot repo that automatically scrapes Chinese language news from major news outlets such as the <New York Times> or <#Radio Free Asia> which ensures that China Dictatorship news will always be new.

It's the war of the anonymous bots against the little pinks, part of asymmetric information warfare: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/asymmetric-information-warfare

= Marie Curie papers
{parent=Updates}
{tag=Marie Curie}

Under <publication by Marie Curie>{full} I did a quick overview of the <papers> in which <Marie Curie> and collaborators publish the existence of new elements <polonium> and <radium>. Both are very understandable (except the <chemistry>), and have some cute terminology. I also cited those papers on her <Wikipedia> page: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marie_Curie&diff=1240252528&oldid=1238097626 Another good exercise in "old paper finding" + "Wikipedia markup/rules" as I looked at the <Comptes rendus de l'AcadÃ©mie des Sciences> a bit.

This was kickstarted by <YouTube> recommending me the following good video:

\Video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgBDvnqMkT4]
{title=The RaLa Experiment by Our Own Devices}

which led me into yet a quick <nuclear physics> binge. I shouldn't do this to myself. I also ended up writing some tentative answers on <Quora>:

{tag=Text-to-speech}

https://askubuntu.com/questions/501910/how-to-text-to-speech-output-using-command-line/1522885#1522885

I tried to use every single free offline <text-to-speech> engine that would run on <Ubuntu 24.04> without too much hassle to see if any of them sounded natural. #pico2wave was the overall winner so far, but it is not perfect.

I've been noticing a gap between the "<AI>" <SOTA> and what is actually packaged well enough to be usable by a general audience.

Also played a bit more with <#OpenAI Whisper>: https://askubuntu.com/questions/24059/automatically-generate-subtitles-close-caption-from-a-video-using-speech-to-text/1522895#1522895 Mind blowing performance and perfect packaging as well, kudos.

= Older updates
{parent=Updates}

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Hassan I delved into a bit of <Wikipedia> drama on the page of <Scott Hassan>, initial coder of <Google Search>, which I created an am the main contributor.

  Originally I had added some details about this messy divorce which saw coverage in major publications such as the <New York Times>: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/Scott-Hassan-Allison-Huynh-divorce.html and Scott used puppets to remove those at several points in time over the years.

  Those removals were then reverted by other editors, not myself, indicating that editors wanted the details there.

  While preparing to finally decide this through moderation, I ended up finding that the divorce details should likely have been left out according to Wikipedia rules, because Scott is "relatively unknown" and a "low profile individual":
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons&oldid=1235693634#People_who_are_relatively_unknown
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Who_is_a_low-profile_individual
  and so I ended up removing them myself.

  This is yet once again <deletionism on Wikipedia> weakening the site, and making @OurBigBook stronger :-) Here is the uncensored one: <#Scott Hassan>

  I spent time on this partly because I'm mildly obsessed with founding myths of companies, but also partly to better understand the moderation process of Wikipedia.

* https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/256138/is-there-any-decent-speech-recognition-software-for-linux/613392#613392 cool to see that the Vosk open source speech recognition software by https://twitter.com/alphacep now has a convenient command line interface called vosk-transcriber! 

  It allows you to just:

  ``
  vosk-transcriber -m ~/var/lib/vosk/vosk-model-en-us-0.22 -i in.ogg -o out.srt -t srt
  ``

  to extract a subtitle file out.srt from a .ogg audio input file.

  Accuracy is a bit meh, but we'll take it!
