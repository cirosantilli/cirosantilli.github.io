= Introductory video for Bitcoin inscription museum

I finally took a day to edit the <Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain> section from <Aratu Week 2024 Talk by Ciro Santilli> into a proper YouTube video. The amount of effort that goes into every minute of video editing never ceases to amaze me.

= I was top user 25 on Stack Overflow in 2024
{parent=Updates}

In 2024 I was user \#25 with the most reputation gained on Stack Overflow.

This is up from \#38 in 2023 is even though I have answered less questions than before.

This is likely because LLMs have killed users that just answered lots of easy new questions, and favored those like me who only answer more important questions found through Google.

I was \#13 on the last quarter, so this is likely to go even higher in 2025. More details at: <ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions>{full}

= Generating test data for full text search tests
{parent=Updates}

I've been thinking lightly about adding full text search to <OurBigBook>.

For example, at https://docs.ourbigbook.com/news/article-and-topic-id-prefix-search article search was added, but it only finds if you search something that appears right at the start of a title, e.g. for:
``
Fundamental theorem of calculus
``
you'd get a hit for:
``
fundamental
``
but not for
``
calculus
``

To do this efficiently, we need full text search, which <PostgreSQL> implements.

But finding a clean way to generate test data for testing out the speedup was not so easy and exploration into this led me to publishing a few new slightly improved methods where Googlers can now find them:

* https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/97160/is-there-something-like-a-lorem-ipsum-generator/787733#787733 I propose a neat random "sentence" generator using common CLI tools like <grep> and <sed> and the pre-installed Ubuntu dictionary `/usr/share/dict/american-english`:
  ``
  grep -v "'" /usr/share/dict/american-english |
  shuf -r |
  paste -d ' ' $(printf "%4s" | sed 's/ /- /g') |
  sed -e 's/^\(.\)/\U\1/;s/$/./' |
  head -n10000000 \
  > lorem.txt
  ``
  * to achieve that, I also proposed two superior "join every N lines" method for the CLI: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25973140/joining-every-group-of-n-lines-into-one-with-bash/79257780#79257780[], notably this <awk> poem:
    ``
    seq 10 | awk '{ printf("%s%s", NR  == 1 ? "" : NR % 3 == 1 ? "\n" : " ", $0 ) } END { printf("\n") }'
    ``
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3371503/sql-populate-table-with-random-data/79255281#79255281 I propose:
  * a clean <PostgreSQL> random string stored procedure that picks random characters from an allowed character list
    ``
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION random_string(int) RETURNS TEXT as $$
    select
    string_agg(substr(characters, (random() * length(characters) + 1)::integer, 1), '') as random_word
    from (values('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-    ')) as symbols(characters)
    join generate_series(1, $1) on 1 = 1
    $$ language sql;  
    ``
  * first generating <PostgreSQL> data as <CSV>, and then importing the CSV into PostgreSQL as a more flexible method. This can also be done in a streaming fashion from stdin which is neat.
    ``
    python generate_data.py 10 | psql mydb -c '\copy "mytable" FROM STDIN'
    ``

Finally I did a writeup summarizing PostgreSQL full text search: <PostgreSQL full-text search>{full} and also dumped it at: https://www.reddit.com/r/PostgreSQL/comments/12yld1o/is_it_worth_using_postgres_builtin_fulltext/[] for good measure.

= Getting a list of all currencies from Wikidata with SPARQL
{parent=Updates}

https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/1560/how-can-i-get-a-list-of-currencies-from-wikidata/21839#21839

I've had a bit more fun with <SPARQL> and <Wikidata>.

This one was way harder than my previous fun with "find the oldest people who won a given prize" (<Nobel prize>/<#Oscar>) https://mastodon.social/@cirosantilli/112689376315990248 because unlike those prizes where all the decisions are centralized, countries are much more complicated beasts, with changing currencies and international recognition.

This was a good experience to see a few ways in which Wikidata is inconsistent, with the same concept being expressed in multiple different ways, e.g. "end time" property of the current vs the superior "end time" qualifier.

Particularly bad is the notion of a "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Ranking#Deprecated_rank[deprecated rank]", that should really not exist.

This is exactly the type of semi interactive data munching that I like to do, a bit in the same vein as <CIA 2010 covert communication websites> and <Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain>.

As you might imagine, the <secret services> use exactly this type of knowledge modelling to do their dirty business, e.g. https://github.com/gchq/Gaffer[Gaffer] by the <GCHQ>.

If only I weren't such a rebel, I'd be a perfect fit for the <intelligence agencies>.

This is the best monstrosity I had the patience to come up with:
``
SELECT
  ?currency
  (GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT ?currencyIsoCode; SEPARATOR=", ") AS ?currencyIsoCodes)
  ?currencyLabel
  (GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT ?countryLabel; SEPARATOR=", ") AS ?countries)
WHERE {
  ?country wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q6256. # is country
  ?country p:P38 ?countryHasCurrency.
  ?countryHasCurrency ps:P38 ?currency.
  ?countryHasCurrency wikibase:rank ?countryHasCurrencyRank.
  OPTIONAL {
    ?currency p:P498 ?currencyHasIsoCode.
    ?currencyHasIsoCode ps:P498 ?currencyIsoCode.
  }
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {?country wdt:P576 ?countryAbolished}
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {?currency wdt:P576 ?currencyAbolished}
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {?currency wdt:P582 ?currencyEndTime}
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {?countryHasCurrency pq:P582 ?countryHasCurrencyEndtime}
  FILTER (?countryHasCurrencyRank != wikibase:DeprecatedRank)
  FILTER (!bound(?currencyHasIsoCode) || ?currencyHasIsoCode != wikibase:DeprecatedRank)
  # TODO makes query take timeout? Why? Needed to exclude PLZ.
  FILTER NOT EXISTS {?currencyHasIsoCode pq:P582 ?currencyHasIsoCodeEndtime}
  SERVICE wikibase:label {
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en".
    ?currency rdfs:label ?currencyLabel .
    ?country rdfs:label ?countryLabel .
  }
}
GROUP BY ?currency ?currencyLabel
ORDER BY ?currencyIsoCodes ?currencyLabel
``
It got quite close to the ISO 4217 list.

I was drawn into this waste of time after I noticed that someone had managed to create the Wikipedia of <PsiQuantum> which I had tried earlier but got deleted: https://mastodon.social/@cirosantilli/113488891292906243[], and then I made the mistake of having a look at the <Wikidata> page of <PsiQuantum>.

I also had one more fun with: https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/15750/structured-data-for-nobel-prizes/21847#21847 getting some basic info about <Nobel Prize> winners, and noticed one, <John Sulston>, <2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine> laureate, who likely has the wrong place of birth on his Nobel Prize profile: https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2002/sulston/facts/ which is funny.

= GitHub blocked the China Dictatorship bot
{parent=Updates}

https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/1330

<GitHub> forbade our <China Dictatorship> auto-reply bot, the reason given is because they forbid comment reply bots in general. Though it was cool to see a junior support staff person giving out what obviously triggered the action:
> We've received a large volume of complaints from other users indicating that the comments and issues are unrelated to the projects they were working on.
before a more senior one took over.

Ciro was slightly saddened but not totally surprized by the bloodbath against him on the Reddit the threads he created:
* https://www.reddit.com/r/github/comments/1g7acv6/github_forbade_me_from_running_a_bot_that_would/ deleted by admins because
  > We don't work for GitHub and we can't help you with your GitHub support problems. You'll just need to be patient.
  which is stupid, obviously we should be able to discuss GitHub policies in that sub.

  Also good highlight to user whoShotMyCow
  > Has GitHub also forbidden you from, say, getting a job
  Reply:
  > No, a 120,000 USD donation did that: https://cirosantilli.com/sponsor#1000-monero-donation
  Reply:

  <Many successful people are neurodiverse> comes to mind.

* https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1g7aa6k/american_programming_website_github_forbade_me/[]: also deleted without reason

So we observe once again the stupidity of <deletionism> towards anything that is considered controversial. The West is discussion fatigued, and would rather delete discussion than have it.

We also se people against you having freedom to moderate your own repositories as you like it, with bots or otherwise. Giving up freedoms for nothing, because "bot is evil".

= Older updates
{parent=Updates}

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Hassan I delved into a bit of <Wikipedia> drama on the page of <Scott Hassan>, initial coder of <Google Search>, which I created an am the main contributor.

  Originally I had added some details about this messy divorce which saw coverage in major publications such as the <New York Times>: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/Scott-Hassan-Allison-Huynh-divorce.html and Scott used puppets to remove those at several points in time over the years.

  Those removals were then reverted by other editors, not myself, indicating that editors wanted the details there.

  While preparing to finally decide this through moderation, I ended up finding that the divorce details should likely have been left out according to Wikipedia rules, because Scott is "relatively unknown" and a "low profile individual":
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons&oldid=1235693634#People_who_are_relatively_unknown
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Who_is_a_low-profile_individual
  and so I ended up removing them myself.

  This is yet once again <deletionism on Wikipedia> weakening the site, and making @OurBigBook stronger :-) Here is the uncensored one: <#Scott Hassan>

  I spent time on this partly because I'm mildly obsessed with founding myths of companies, but also partly to better understand the moderation process of Wikipedia.
