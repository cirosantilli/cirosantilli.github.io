= Group of Lie type
{parent=classification-of-finite-simple-groups}
{wiki}

= Groups of Lie type
{synonym}

In the \x[classification-of-finite-simple-groups], groups of Lie type are a set of infinite families of simple lie groups. These are the other infinite families besides te \x[cyclic-group]{p} and \x[alternating-group]{p}.

A decent list at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_finite_simple_groups[], https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Lie_type[] is just too unclear. The groups of Lie type can be subdivided into:
* \x[chevalley-group]{child}{p}
* TODO the rest

The first in this family discovered were a subset of the \x[chevalley-groups-a-n-q] by \x[galois]: \x[psl-2-p], so it might be a good first one to try and understand what it looks like.

TODO understand intuitively why they are called of Lie type. Their names $A_n$, $B_n$ seem to correspond to the members of the \x[classification-of-simple-lie-groups] which are also named like that.

But they are of course related to \x[lie-group]{p}, and as suggested at \x[video-yang-mills-1-by-david-metzler-2011] part 2, the continuity actually simplifies things.

This was the first infinite family of \x[simple-group]{p} discovered after the simple \x[cyclic-group]{p} and \x[alternating-group]{p}. The first case discovered was \x[psl-2-p] by \x[galois]. You should understand that one first.

Examples of \x[exceptional-object]{p}{parent}.

{c}
{parent=sporadic-group}
{wiki}

Contains the first \x[sporadic-group]{p} discovered by far: 11 and 12 in 1861, and 22, 23 and 24 in 1973. And therefore presumably the simplest! The next sporadic ones discovered were the \x[janko-group]{p}, only in 1965!

Each \x[m-n] is a \x[permutation-group] on $n$ elements. There isn't an obvious algorithmic relationship between $n$ and the actual group.

TODO initial motivation? Why did Mathieu care about \x[k-transitive-group]{p}?

Their; \x[k-transitive-group] properties seem to be the main characterization, according to Wikipedia:
* 22 is 3-transitive but not 4-transitive.
* four of them (11, 12, 23 and 24) are the only \x[sporadic-group][sporadic] \x[k-transitive-group][4-transitive] groups as per the \x[classification-of-4-transitive-groups] (no known simpler proof as of 2021), which sounds like a reasonable characterization. Note that 12 and 25 are also 5 transitive.
Looking at the \x[classification-of-k-transitive-groups] we see that the Mathieu groups are the only families of 4 and 5 transitive groups other than \x[symmetric-group]{p} and \x[alternating-group]{p}. 3-transitive is not as nice, so let's just say it is the \x[stabilizer-group] of $M_23$ and be done with it.

Other common examples include isomorphisms of \x[vector-space]{p} and \x[field-mathematics]{p}. But since both of those two are much simpler than groups in \x[classification-mathematics], as they are both determined by number of elements/dimension alone, see:

* \x[all-vector-spaces-of-the-same-dimension-on-a-given-field-are-isomorphic]
we tend to not talk about isomorphisms so much in those contexts.

Like isomorphism, but does not have to be one-to-one: multiple different inputs can have the same output.

The image is as for any function smaller or equal in size as the domain of course.

This brings us to the key intuition about group homomorphisms: they are a way to split out a larger group into smaller groups that retains a subset of the original structure.

As shown by the \x[fundamental-theorem-on-homomorphisms], each group homomorphism is fully characterized by a \x[normal-subgroup] of the domain.

Immediately gives the \x[generating-set-of-a-group] by looking at elements adjacent to the origin, and more generally the \x[order-of-an-element-of-a-group][order of each element].

TODO \x[uniqueness]: can two different \x[group]{p} have the same cycle graph? It does not seem to tell us how every element interact with every other element, only with itself. This is in contrast with the \x[cayley-graph], which more accurately describes group structure (but does not give the order of elements as directly), so feels like it won't be unique.

= Cycle of an element of a group
{parent=generating-set-of-a-group}

Take the element and apply it to itself. Then again. And so on.

In the case of a \x[finite-group], you have to eventually reach the \x[identity-element] again sooner or later, giving you the \x[order-of-an-element-of-a-group].

The continuous analogue for the cycle of a group are the \x[one-parameter-subgroup]{p}. In the continuous case, you sometimes reach identity again and to around infinitely many times (which always happens in the finite case), but sometimes you don't.

As per https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Semidirect_product&oldid=1040813965#Properties[], unlike the \x[direct-product], the semidirect product of two goups is neither \x[unique], nor does it always \x[exist], and there is no known algorithmic way way to tell if one exists or not.

This is because reaching the "output" of the semidirect produt of two groups requires extra non-obvious information that might not exist. This is because the semi-direct product is based on the \x[product-of-group-subsets]. So you start with two small and completely independent groups, and it is not obvious how to join them up, i.e. how to define the group operation of the product group that is compatible with that of the two smaller input groups. Contrast this with the \x[direct-product], where the composition is simple: just use the group operation of each group on either side.

Product of group subsets

So in other words, it is not a \x[function-mathematics] like the \x[direct-product]. The semidiret product is therefore more like a property of three groups. 

The semidirect product is more general than the \x[direct-product-of-groups] when thinking about the \x[group-extension-problem], because with the \x[direct-product-of-groups], both subgroups of the larger group are necessarily also normal (trivial projection \x[group-homomorphism] on either side), while for the semidirect product, only one of them does.

Conversely, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Semidirect_product&oldid=1040813965 explains that if $G = N \rtimes H$, and besides the implied requirement that N is normal, H is also normal, then $G = N \times H$.

Smallest example: $D_6 = C_3 \rtimes C_2$ where $D$ is a \x[dihedral-group] and $C$ are \x[cyclic-group]{p}. $C_3$ (the rotation) is a normal subgroup of $D_6$, but $C_2$ (the flip) is not.

Note that with the \x[direct-product] instead we get $C_6$ and not $D_6$, i.e. $C_3 \times C_2 = C_6$ as per \x[the-direct-product-of-two-cyclic-groups-of-coprime-order-is-another-cyclic-group].

TODO:
* why does one of the groups have to be normal in the definition?
* what is the smallest example of a non-\x[simple-group] that is neither a direct nor a semi-direct product of any two other groups?

Quotient of a subgroup H of G by a \x[normal-subgroup] of the subgroup H.

As an overkill example, the happy family are subquotients of the \x[monster-group], but the monster group is simple.

= Relationship between the quotient group and direct products
{parent=quotient-group}

Although quotients look a bit real number division, there are some important differences with the "group analog of multiplication" of \x[direct-product-of-groups].

If a group is isomorphic to the \x[direct-product-of-groups], we can take a quotient of the product to retrieve one of the groups, which is somewhat analogous to division: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/723707/how-is-the-quotient-group-related-to-the-direct-product-group

The "converse" is not always true however: a group does not need to be isomorphic to the product of one of its \x[normal-subgroup]{p} and the associated \x[quotient-group]. The wiki page provides an example:
\Q[
Given G and a normal subgroup N, then G is a group extension of G/N by N. One could ask whether this extension is trivial or split; in other words, one could ask whether G is a direct product or semidirect product of N and G/N. This is a special case of the extension problem. An example where the extension is not split is as follows: Let $G = Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}$, and $ = {0, 2}$ which is isomorphic to Z2. Then G/N is also isomorphic to Z2. But Z2 has only the trivial automorphism, so the only semi-direct product of N and G/N is the direct product. Since Z4 is different from Z2 Ã Z2, we conclude that G is not a semi-direct product of N and G/N.
]

TODO find a less minimal but possibly more important example.

This is also semi mentioned at: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1596500/when-is-a-group-isomorphic-to-the-product-of-normal-subgroup-and-quotient-group

I think this might be equivalent to why the \x[group-extension-problem] is hard. If this relation were true, then taking the direct product would be the only way to make larger groups from normal subgroups/quotients. But it's not.

Ultimate explanation: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/776039/intuition-behind-normal-subgroups/3732426#3732426

Only normal subgroups can be used to form \x[quotient-group]{p}: their key definition is that they plus their cosets form a group.

Intuition:

* https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1014535/is-there-any-intuitive-understanding-of-normal-subgroup/1014791

One key intuition is that "a normal subgroup is the \x[kernel-algebra]" of a \x[group-homomorphism], and the normal subgroup plus cosets are isomorphic to the image of the isomorphism, which is what the \x[fundamental-theorem-on-homomorphisms] says.

Therefore "there aren't that many \x[group-homomorphism]", and a normal subgroup it is a concrete and natural way to uniquely represent that homomorphism.

The best way to think about the, is to always think first: what is the homomorphism? And then work out everything else from there.

* distributes over addition (the default group operation)
* has an identity

Unlike addition, that multiplication does not need to satisfy:
* \x[commutative-property]. If this is satisfied, we can call it a \x[commutative-ring].
* existence of an inverse. If this is satisfied, we can call it a \x[division-ring].
If those are also satisfied, then we have a \x[field-mathematics].

The simplest example of a ring which is not a full fledged \x[field-mathematics] and with \x[commutative] multiplication are the \x[integer]{p}. Notably, no inverses exist except for the identity itself and -1. E.g. the inverse of 2 would be 1/2 which is not in the \x[set-mathematics].

A \x[polynomial-ring] is another example with the same properties as the \x[integer]{p}.

The simplest non-commutative ring that is not a \x[field-mathematics] is the set of all 2x2 \x[matrix]{p} of \x[real-number]{p}:
* we know that 2x2 matrix multiplication is non-commutative in general
* some 2x2 matrices have a multiplicative inverse, but others don't
Note that \x[gl-n] is not a ring because you can by addition reach the zero matrix.

Two ways to see it:
* a \x[ring-mathematics] where \x[inverse]{p} exist
* a \x[field-mathematics] where multiplication is not necessarily \x[commutative]

= Field
{disambiguate=mathematics}
{parent=ring-mathematics}
{wiki}

A \x[ring-mathematics] where multiplication is \x[commutative] and there is always an inverse.

A field can be seen as an \x[abelian-group] that has two group operations: addition and multiplication, and they are compatible (distributive property).

Basically the nicest, least restrictive, 2-operation type of \x[algebra].

Examples:
* \x[real-number]{p}
* \x[rational-number]{p}

= Distributive property
{parent=field-mathematics}
{wiki}

One of the defining properties of \x[algebraic-structure] with two operations such as \x[ring-mathematics] and \x[field-mathematics]:
$$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$
This property shows how the two operations interact.

= Finite field
{parent=field-mathematics}
{title2=$GF(n)$}
{wiki}

A convenient notation for the elements of $GF(n)$ of prime order is to use \x[integer]{p}, e.g. for $GF(7)$ we could write:
$$
GR(7) = \{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\}
$$
which makes it clear what is the additive inverse of each element, although sometimes a notation starting from 0 is also used:
$$
GR(7) = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
$$

For fields of \x[prime] order, regular \x[modular-arithmetic] works as the field operation.

For non-prime order, we see that \x[modular-arithmetic] does not work because the divisors have no inverse. E.g. at order 6, 2 and 3 have no inverse, e.g. for 2:
$$
0 \times 2 = 0
1 \times 2 = 2
2 \times 2 = 4
3 \times 2 = 0
4 \times 2 = 2
5 \times 2 = 4
$$
we see that things wrap around perfecly, and 1 is never reached.

For non-prime \x[prime-power] orders however, we can find a way, see \x[finite-field-of-non-prime-order].

= Classification of finite fields
{parent=finite-field}

There's exactly one field per \x[prime-power], So all we need to specify a field is give its order, notated e.g. as $GF(n)$.

Every element of a finite field satisfies $x^{order} = x$.

It is interesting to compare this result philosophically with the \x[classification-of-finite-groups]: fields are more constrained as they have to have two operations, and this leads to a much simpler classification!

= Finite field of non-prime order
{parent=finite-field}

As per \x[classification-of-finite-fields] those must be of \x[prime-power] order.

\x[video-finite-fields-made-easy-by-randell-heyman-2015] at https://youtu.be/z9bTzjy4SCg?t=159 shows how for order $9 = 3 \times 3$. Basically, for order $p^n$, we take:
* each element is a polynomial in $GF(p)[x]$, $GF(p)[x]$, the \x[polynomial-over-a-field][polynomial ring over the finite field $GF(p)$] with degree smaller than $n$. We've just seen how to construct $GF(p)$ for prime $p$ above, so we're good there.
* addition works element-wise modulo on $GF(p)$
* multiplication is done modulo an \x[irreducible-polynomial] of order $n$
For a worked out example, see: \x[gf-4].

\x[ciro-santilli] tried to https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finite_field&type=revision&diff=1044934168&oldid=1044905041[add this example to Wikipedia], but revert, so here we are.

This is a good first example of a field of a \x[finite-field-of-non-prime-order], this one is a \x[prime-power] order instead.

$4 = 2^2$, so one way to represent the elements of the field will be the to use the 4 polynomials of degree 1 over \x[gf-2]:
* 0X + 0
* 0X + 1
* 1X + 0
* 1X + 1

Note that we refer in this definition to anther field, but that is fine, because we only refer to fields of \x[prime] order such as \x[gf-2], because we are dealing with \x[prime-power]{p} only. And we have already defined fields of prime order easily previously with \x[modular-arithmetic].

Over GF(2), there is only one \x[irreducible-polynomial] of degree 2:
$$X^2+X+1$$

Addition is defined element-wise with \x[modular-arithmetic] modulo 2 as defined over GF(2), e.g.:
$$(1X + 0) + (1X + 1) = (1 + 1)X + (0 + 1) = 0X + 1$$

Multiplication is done modulo $X^2+X+1$, which ensures that the result is also of degree 1.

For example first we do a regular multiplication:
$$(1X + 0) \times (1X + 1) = (1 \times 1)X^2 + (1 \times 1)X + (0 \times 1)X + (0 \times 1) = 1X^2 + 1X + 0$$

Without modulo, that would not be one of the elements of the field anymore due to the $1X^2$!

So we take the modulo, we note that:
$$1X^2 + 1X + 0 = 1(X^2+X+1) + (0X + 1)$$
and by the definition of modulo:
$$(1X^2 + 1X + 0) \mod (X^2+X+1) = (0X + 1)$$
which is the final result of the multiplication.

TODO show how taking a reducible polynomial for modulo fails. Presumably it is for a similar reason to why things fail for the prime case.

= Algebra over a field
{parent=vector-field}

A \x[vector-field] with a \x[bilinear-map] into itself, which we can also call a "vector product".

Note that the vector product does not have to be neither \x[associative] nor \x[commutative].

Examples: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Algebra_over_a_field&oldid=1035146107#Motivating_examples

* \x[r-3] with the \x[cross-product]
* \x[quaternion]{p}, i.e. \x[r-4] with the quaternion multiplication
