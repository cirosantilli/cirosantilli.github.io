"Arm on tracks" refers to a variant of the <robotic arm> <robot form factor> in which the position of attachment of the <robotic arm> can also be moved around linearly or with more degrees of freedom.

E.g.:
* <Everyday Robots> robot
* <Transcendence (2014)> robots

It is a bit rough, but kind of works. Flight control is only left or right though, they don't stimulate the wings directly.

TRI means <Toyota Research Institute> BTW.

> The Robotics team at TRI is working hard to close the gap between simulation and reality. For manipulation, one important piece is accurate simulation of rigid-body contact.
