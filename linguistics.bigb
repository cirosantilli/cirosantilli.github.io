<ciro santilli> had to see this in a few separate places, until he underestood: that little pictur emust be a thing! Examples:

= Phonemic orthography

{wiki}

= Syllabary
{parent=phonemic-orthography}

= Abugida
{parent=syllabary}
{wiki}

Somewhat midway between a <syllabary> and an <alphabet>: you write out consonants, and vowels are "punctuation-like-modifiers".

E.g.: the main <Hindi> script (<devanagari>) and most other <Indian> languages.

= Abjad
{parent=abugida}
{wiki}

Unlike <abugida>, these actually make you guess vowels, which are mostly or all not written down in any way. Terrible.

E.g.: the main <Arabic> script.

= Greek alphabet
{c}
{parent=alphabet}
{wiki}

Unfortunately, <physicists> and <mathematicians> keep using Greek letters in their formulas, so we just have to learn them.

A helpful way to remember is to learn a bit of their history/pronunciation: <historical correspondence between Latin and Greek>{full}.

To learn the greek letters if you have a base latin alphabet, you \i[must] learn the sound of each letter, and which <Latin letters> they correspond to.

Symbols that look like Greek letters but are not Greek letters:
* <nabla symbol>

Is <ciro santilli> crazy (he is, but for this point specifically), or do many/most <Greek letters> represent the mouth position used in the pronunciation of the letter?

= Gamma

{title2=$\Gamma$, $\gamma$, C, G}

It is fun to see that C and G have been confused since antiquity:
* the modern sound is <G>
* in terms of modern letters, both <C> and <G> split from <gamma>

Confusingly, in <LaTeX>:
* `\varepsilon` rendered $\varepsilon$, is the default modern Greek glyph
* `\epsilon` rendered $\epsilon$ is the lunate variant

= Zeta

Lower case looks like the mouth shape when you say Z, with mouth open, and you can even see the little tongue going down. Beauty.

= Eta

Lowercase looks like a lowercase <letter N> for some reason.

= Nu
{disambiguate=letter}
{parent=greek-alphabet}
{title2=$\Nu$, $\nu$, N}

= Nu
{synonym}

Why would <physicists> use a letter such that:
* the upper case version looks exactly like an upper case <N>. At least that is the correct pronunciation/name/historical successor of $\nu$.
* the lower case version looks exactly like a lower case <V>
Why? Why?????????

{parent=greek-alphabet}
{title2=$\Pi$, $\pi$, P}
{wiki}

= Rho
{parent=greek-alphabet}
{title2=$\Rho$, $\rho$, R}
{wiki}

This one is a little confusing: the upper case looks exactly like a <letter P>, but as the name suggests, it actually corresponds to the <letter R>. The <letter P> corresponds to <pi (letter)> instead.

= Phi
{parent=greek-alphabet}
{title2=$\Phi$, $\phi$, $\varphi$, F}
{wiki}

Two lower case variants... both used in <mathematical notation>, and for some reason, in <LaTeX> `\varphi` is the one that actually looks like the default standard modern lowercase phi, while `\phi` is the weird one. I love life.

= Psi

{parent=greek-alphabet}
{title2=$\Psi$, $\psi$}

As if it weren't enough, there's also a <Cyrillic script> psi that is slightly different. Life's great.
