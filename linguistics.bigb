Middle names are a weird custom.

It's like a semi-secret part of your name that you only randomly use sometimes, and usually only in initials, and which no one else knows except your family.

It is as if the <Anglo-Saxons> were preparing for a real world <#Death Note> attack <I Know Your True Name>-style.

Euphemisms are <evil> <bullshit>.

Just say what you mean to say,

<Don't be a pussy>.

If you've been fired, say you been fired, not "let go".

If someone died, say they died, not "passed away".

<Ciro Santilli> had to see this in a few separate places, until he underestood: that little pictur emust be a thing! Examples:

= Phonemic orthography
{parent=Writing system}
{wiki}

= Syllabary
{parent=Phonemic orthography}

= Abugida
{parent=Syllabary}
{wiki}

Somewhat midway between a <syllabary> and an <alphabet>: you write out consonants, and vowels are "punctuation-like-modifiers".

E.g.: the main <Hindi> script (<devanagari>) and most other <Indian> languages.

= Abjad
{parent=Abugida}
{wiki}

Unlike <abugida>, these actually make you guess vowels, which are mostly or all not written down in any way. Terrible.

E.g.: the main <Arabic> script.

= Greek alphabet
{c}
{parent=Alphabet}
{wiki}

Unfortunately, <physicists> and <mathematicians> keep using Greek letters in their formulas, so we just have to learn them.

A helpful way to remember is to learn a bit of their history/pronunciation: <historical correspondence between Latin and Greek>{full}.

To learn the greek letters if you have a base latin alphabet, you \i[must] learn the sound of each letter, and which <Latin letters> they correspond to.

Symbols that look like Greek letters but are not Greek letters:
* <nabla symbol>

Is <Ciro Santilli> crazy (he is, but for this point specifically), or do many/most <Greek letters> represent the mouth position used in the pronunciation of the letter?

{title2=$\Gamma$}

{title2=C}
{title2=G}

It is fun to see that C and G have been confused since antiquity:
* the modern sound is <G>
* in terms of modern letters, both <C> and <G> split from <gamma>

{title2=E}
{wiki}

= Epsilon
{synonym}

Confusingly, in <LaTeX>:
* `\varepsilon` rendered $\varepsilon$, is the default modern Greek glyph
* `\epsilon` rendered $\epsilon$ is the lunate variant

= Greek letter epsilon

= Zeta
{disambiguate=letter}
{parent=Greek alphabet}
{title2=$\Zeta$}
{title2=$\zeta$}

Lower case looks like the mouth shape when you say Z, with mouth open, and you can even see the little tongue going down. Beauty.

= Eta
{disambiguate=letter}
{parent=Greek alphabet}
{title2=$\Eta$}
{title2=$\eta$}
{title2=H}

Lowercase looks like a lowercase <letter N> for some reason.

= Nu
{disambiguate=letter}
{parent=Greek alphabet}
{title2=$\Nu$}
{title2=$\nu$}
{title2=N}

= Nu
{synonym}

Why would <physicists> use a letter such that:
* the upper case version looks exactly like an upper case <N>. At least that is the correct pronunciation/name/historical successor of $\nu$.
* the lower case version looks exactly like a lower case <V>
Why? Why?????????

= Pi

{parent=Greek alphabet}
{title2=$\Pi$}
{title2=$\pi$}
{title2=P}
{wiki}

= Rho
{parent=Greek alphabet}
{title2=$\Rho$}
{title2=$\rho$}
{title2=R}
{wiki}

This one is a little confusing: the upper case looks exactly like a <letter P>, but as the name suggests, it actually corresponds to the <letter R>. The <letter P> corresponds to <pi (letter)> instead.

= Phi
{parent=Greek alphabet}
{title2=$\Phi$}
{title2=$\phi$}
{title2=$\varphi$}
{title2=F}
{wiki}

Two lower case variants... both used in <mathematical notation>, and for some reason, in <LaTeX> `\varphi` is the one that actually looks like the default standard modern lowercase phi, while `\phi` is the weird one. I love life.

= Psi

{parent=Greek alphabet}

As if it weren't enough, there's also a <Cyrillic script> psi that is slightly different. Life's great.
