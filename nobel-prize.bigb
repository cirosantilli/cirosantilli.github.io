Understand and explain amazingly every single \x[nobel-prize] in \x[physics], \x[chemistry] and \x[biology]. Since in particular the \x[nobel-foundation] is unable to do that for any at all, especially of the key old ones, e.g. https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/summary/[]. Hopeless.

To be fair, those in theoretical physics at least basically come down to reading a bunch of books. But perhaps anything slightly more experimental could have
