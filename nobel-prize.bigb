Understand and explain amazingly every single <nobel prize> in <physics>, <chemistry> and <biology>. Since in particular the <Nobel Foundation> is unable to do that for any at all, especially of the key old ones, e.g. https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/summary/[]. Hopeless.

To be fair, those in theoretical physics at least basically come down to reading a bunch of books. But perhaps anything slightly more experimental could have
