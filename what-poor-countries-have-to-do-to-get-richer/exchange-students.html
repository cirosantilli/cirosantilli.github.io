Just <a href="https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/#university-espionage">don't do fraudulent stuff like this</a> like China did, or else you will get a bad rep.</div><div class="p" id="_25">To help this university collaboration happen, we should create communication channels between exchange students and professors of the origin country who work on the same domain so that they can discuss the subject. For example, once <a href="../ciro-santilli">Ciro Santilli</a> wanted to contact some of his former teachers at the <a href="../university#university-of-sao-paulo">University of São Paulo</a> about "advanced" topics he had been exposed to as part of his job. However, they didn't even reply to his email, and Ciro didn't know who else to contact. This must never happen. We need a way to informally contact several professors of a given domain informally, to increase the chances that at least one might be interested. It is pointless to just let students loose abroad and hope that they will bring things back to their home country: a more cohesive infrastructure is needed to nurture that.</div><div class="p" id="_26">There is basically one sane way to achieve these goals: the exchange programs must be organized at a national level, not in an ad-hoc per-university manner.</div><div class="p" id="_27">Another good idea is to have taxes that depend on your nationality alone and which only start collecting when you reach a very high amount of net worth. So e.g. if someone leaves the country and makes it big, then and only then does the Government starts clawing back the benefits of its investments in the person. Furthermore, such taxes could be reduced if the person brings some of the business back to the country. And mandatory taxes should be charged if the person decides to drop their nationality at some point.</div><div class="p" id="_28">The above points would also be greatly eased by having a national-level exchange program. E.g. in <a href="../brazil">Brazil</a> in the 2010's which Ciro experience, every university had different terms and conditions, which made everything a mess. Exchange programs must be treated as a unified federal policy.</div><div class="p" id="_29">Ciro actually had to return for just six months from the <a href="../ecole-polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a> to the <a href="../university#university-of-sao-paulo">University of São Paulo</a>, to finish a course he had only done the generic Maths/Physics introduction to. Students from other Brazilian universities were forced to return for up to 3 years even to get their Brazilian diplomas! Ciro was lucky that his teachers understood the situation, and allowed him to develop online learning projects instead of his supposed control engineering projects, which hopefully will have led to changing the world with <a href="../ourbigbook-com#motivation">motivation</a> one day. And for this, Ciro is eternally thankful.</div><div class="p" id="_30">This shows the complete and total lack of any Brazilian strategy to send its students abroad to really learn valuable things and then come back. There is no strategy at all. Things have just reached an equilibrium point of bureaucracies, Brazilian universities trying to bring students back to validate useless diploma pieces of paper, and foreign universities no caring about that, and just wanting the students to say abroad forever.</div><div class="p" id="_31">Ciro was once talking about why so few Brazilians go study abroad compared to the Chinese. Besides the likely true "there are a lot of Chinese" argument, his <a href="../ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-wife">wife</a> made another: good point Brazil is not so bad to live in, because you have good food and freedom, while China only has good food.</div><div class="p" id="_32">But Ciro still fells bad that so few of his <a href="../university#university-of-sao-paulo">University of São Paulo</a> colleagues, who learnt automation and control engineering, are doing <a href="../technology#deep-tech">deep tech</a>. Nor physical engineering. They have all basically become computer people like Ciro.</div><div class="p" id="_33">This is not their fault. They basically don't have a choice: all physical science and technology is done in rich countries.</div><div class="p" id="_34">Yes, someone has to implement the newest tech to improve local country efficiency in projects that will never spread abroad.</div><div class="p" id="_35">But who will be left then for <a href="../ciro-santilli#the-next-big-thing">the next big thing</a> problems that would really make Brazil richer? 6 out of 30 person class ended up working on a gaming company at one point, even though they were not crazy passionate about the field! What could possibly be a <a href="../art">worst investment for society</a>?</div><div class="p" id="_36">This lack of technological innovation can also be clearly seen when you research investment options available in Brazil. Huge emphasis is put on fixed return financial products (often inflation adjusted) linked to base non-tech business such as housing market and agriculture. And when you look to the returns of the <a href="../economy#stock-market">stock market</a> on <a href="../economy#s-and-p-500">s&amp;P 500</a>-analogue backed <a href="../economy#exchange-traded-fund">exchange-traded funds</a>, they do not seem obviously better, especially considering inflation and <a href="../social-technology#tax">taxation</a> benefits that exist for some of the other investment possibilities.</div><div class="p" id="_37">When the <a href="../company">companies</a> of a country are not clearly the best investment, you know that something is wrong. They are highly specialized money making machines, remember! And housing and agriculture are not such innovative markets where people can hugely influence efficiency.</div><div class="p" id="_38">When it is best to send students is a good question. <a href="../university#undergraduate-education">Undergrad</a> studies could be easily reproduced in poor countries if they had any intelligence at all, since even in rich countries laboratory usage is always limited. Masters and PhD are generally more valuable moments to send people out. The question is if the students will actually have a fighting chance without having been out, in particular in terms of language skills. Ciro feels that Masters are a good focus point for entry, as that is where PhD links are more actively done.</div><div class="toc-container" id="_toc"><ul><li class="has-child toplevel"><div class="title-div"><div class="arrow"><div></div></div><span class="not-arrow"><a class="title toc" href="#_toc"> Table of contents</a><input class="search" placeholder="🔍 Search.
