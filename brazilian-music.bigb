The Portuguese term for it is "música popular brasileira". The widely recognized Brazilian acronym is "MPB".

"Brazilian pop" and "Br-pop" are inventions by <Ciro Santilli>, which are how Ciro thinks Brazil should market it to the world.

Unfortunately "B-pop" is too ambiguous with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_pop_music[British pop music], and should be avoided.

<YouTube> playlist by <Ciro Santilli> containing all the songs in this section: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcZOZrP1P_V4_SBDnegcLTcP-5YhNmWBB

= The best popular Brazilian music (MPB) of all time
{parent=Brazilian pop}

It is such a huge shame that you have to understand <Portuguese (language)> to appreciate those songs... this is yet another great evil outcome of <having more than one natural language is bad for the world>.

The good songs stopped before of just after <Ciro Santilli> was born, they were originally heard by his parent's generation. Those young new kids are boring.

The place to start is definitely <the Holy Trinity of popular brazilian music>:
* <Caetano Veloso> is arguably <Ciro Santilli>'s favorite MPB artist, he has just too many amazing songs, best ones at: <The best Caetano Veloso songs>{full}
* <Chico Buarque>. Ciro's second favorite.
* <Gilberto Gil>. Perhaps Ciro likes him third because he is the most lighthearted one, although not always: <The best Gilberto Gil songs>{full}

  {title=As Curvas da Estrada de <Santos, São Paulo, Brazil>[Santos] by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carlos_(singer)[Roberto Carlos] (1969)}
  {description=
  Translation: "The curves of the road of Santos".

  Roberto Carlos makes Ciro cringe, it brings back memories of pre-New Year television Galas in the early 2000s at his great aunt's home in <Santos, São Paulo, Brazil>.

  This is the only bearable song by the artist, as it talks about going down to Ciro's beloved <Santos, São Paulo, Brazil> from the city of <São Paulo>, which lies on a plateau of about 700 meters above sea level, a trip that takes you down through the spectacular https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serra_do_Mar[Serra do Mar] tropical rainforest.

  The mountainous roads of the older road, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodovia_Anchieta[Rodovia Anchieta] there are very curvy, and can be very dangerous when there is fog. The heavy truck traffic to/from the port of Santos makes this even worse.

  But it also makes everything much more spectacular, as you get closer to the forest, and at slower speeds, with occasional panoramic views of the city.

  The newer road, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodovia_dos_Imigrantes[Rodovia dos Imigrantes] is a straighter, safer and boring alternative to it.

  Ciro did this many times on bus when he was <Ciro Santilli's formal education>[studying at the university of São Paulo] and going back home for the weekend from time to time.

{parent=Popular brazilian music musician}

In <Ciro Santilli>'s view, the following three artists form a <Holy Trinity> of <popular Brazilian music>:
* <Caetano Veloso>
* <Chico Buarque>
* <Gilberto Gil>

<Elis Regina> is not far though.

Ciro remembers quite clearly when he was riding the car with <Ciro Santilli's parents>[his parents] when he pre teen, and he could not understand why they seemed so obsessed with The Trinity et al. Ciro in particular remembers listening to <video Refazenda by Gilberto Gil (1975)>. They had picked it up of course from the 70's and 80's when they were younger.

Young Ciro would also always confuse who was whom from the three of them.

Then Ciro got older, and he understood, they are <mind blowing>. You do have to look back in time a bit though, lots of lukewarm stuff on later periods. The <military dictatorship in Brazil> was good for music.

Within the <The Holy Trinity of popular Brazilian music>, Caetano has the most <New Age> religious feel to him. He is also perhaps the most varied of the trinity however, also covering heavier topics at times.

    This song talks about a man's mixed desires to remain with his partner and also escape to adventure. It contains one of the most amazing <sexual innuendo> ever recorded: the man describes foods that his partner will serve him, and the he endlessly eats and eats and eats:
    \Q[eu como, eu como, eu como, você \[... huge intentional pause ...\] não está entendendo quase nada do que eu digo.]
    translation:
    \Q[I eat, I eat, I eat, you \[... huge intentional pause ...\] don't understand anything that I'm saying.]
    which makes it unclear "you" is part of "I eat you" (to eat (comer) is a slang for <fucking>), or if "you" is part of the next sentence.

Gilberto is definitely the most psychedelic/tribal one of the <The Holy Trinity of popular Brazilian music>, though he also has a boyish quality to his soul.

He is also perhaps the one that impresses <Ciro Santilli> the most, at times he can't help but feel:
> OMG how the hell did he come up with that?!

  {description=
  This song is the opening theme of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%ADtio_do_Picapau_Amarelo_(1977_TV_series)[1977 children's television series] based on the renowned children books of the same name by Brazilian author Monteiro Lobato.

  The same song was also used on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sítio_do_Picapau_Amarelo_(2001_TV_series)[2001 series], e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9RbBcDTRAI[].

  The choice of Gilberto Gil as a singer and composer was a stroke of genius, as his natural quirkiness perfectly suits the subject matter of the books.

Very good documentary!

<IMDB> entry: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1252389/

This is a documentary about <Gilberto Gil> going back to his homelnd for the first time since he emigrated to Salvador/Rio, with some of his most popular songs intermixed into it. Beautiful!

"Tempo Rei" is the name of a <Song composed by Gilberto Gil>.

Of particular note is the <video Lamento Sertanejo scene from the 2002 documentary Tempo Rei>.

Mostly interpreter of songs written by others. But she's just too amazing, many of her interpretations are better than the original.

<God>, even <Ciro Santilli> is slightly shocked by her death, which happened before he was born, can you imagine it at the time? She was MPB's golden girl...

This incredibly foul mouthed band was incredibly funny.

<Ciro Santilli> was a bit young to understand the songs at the time, but the older boys were singing them, and he sang along. So maybe there is a nostalgia factor in play.

But it can't be just that. They are just too funny and brutal, even when Ciro re-listens to it as of 2020.

Many <Brazilian> <religious> cranks in were really happy when their plane crashed and killed all of them in 1996.

Official <YouTube> channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPmfP5LNbxYwlN0k6C3F_6w

Best songs:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz7101ulkK0[Pelados Em Santos (1995)]. Not too amazing, they only try to be funny by making fun of the North-Eastern accent of Brazil, which is considered somewhat funny in <São Paulo (state)>, and they fail at being funny.

  But it talks about <Santos, São Paulo, Brazil>, Ciro's idolized city, so let's hear it. They didn't live in Santos apparently, but being from <São Paulo City>, they would have been familiar with that popular local beach location.
