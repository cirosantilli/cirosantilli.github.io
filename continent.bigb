All interests are based on <fetishes>.

The fetish of beauty. The fetish if intelligence. The fetish of kindness.

What's wrong with the fetish of Asianess?

Whenever Ciro's wife starts with "the Asian fetish talk", Ciro reminds her of her own claimed "tall person fetish", and they call it quits.

Asian fetish is much more than <sex>. It is about the culture, the history, the language. It is the same fetish that makes great <mathematicians> an <artists> do what they do.

When <Ciro Santilli> was at <Ã‰cole Polytechnique>, he had to do a presentation for his stupid English courses that all students were forced to take, no matter how good their English was.

The topic was likely something like "pick a country", and Ciro was delighted when he managed to pick "China", after it had gone around a table with many many people before him.

The <PowerPoint> presentation Ciro made over the weekend was so amazing (and making it was actually fun to make, Ciro <Ciro Santilli's bad old event memory>[actually] remembers it a bit!), drawing partly from stuff his <Ciro Santilli's wife>[wife then girlfriend showed him], that at the end the one of the other students asked him if he had lived in China.

It is a shame Ciro couldn't find the presentation when he wrote this line many many years later. Anything that is not in a <blob>-free <monorepo>, will disappear, heed my words. But he's certain about two things which it contained:
* <century eggs>
* Chinese traditional painting

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_fetish#History_of_origins
\Q[In the United States, women of East and Southeast Asian descent are sometimes stereotyped as subservient, passive, mysterious, villainous in nature, and hyper-sexual.]
subservient, passive, mysterious are understandable. But Hyper-sexual and villainous? OMG have these people never seen real Asians?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_fetish#Pornography[]:
\Q[Several studies have implied that Asian women are over-represented in the American pornography industry. Asian women make up perhaps 20% of all female performers, despite being roughly 2.5% of the U.S. population. Asian men also appear to be considerably over-represented, at 10% of male actors.]

The Israeli occupation is obscene.

The only reason the UN doesn't do anything is that other countries can't be bothered to send people to fight Israel and die there.

And the outcome of this is fundamentalism and indirect deaths elsewhere.

{wiki}

<Ciro Santilli> lived in Paris for a few years between 2013 and 2016, and he can confirm the uncontroversial fact that "Paris is Magic".

Not just one type of magic though. Every quarter in Paris has its own unique personality that sets it apart and gives it a different mood.

Ciro knows Paris not from its historical facts, but from the raw feeling of endless walks through its streets in different times of the year. Ciro is a walker.

Maybe one day Ciro will expand this section to try and convey into words his feelings of love for the city, but maybe the effort would be pointless. Maybe such feelings can only be felt by other free-roaming walker souls living in the city, and that is both beautiful and a shame.

See also the  <Cirodance>[legendary Cirodance bowl of soup episode at Place de la RÃ©publique].

Ciro had written the following in the past before he lived in smaller cities, <Ciro Santilli's cycling>[started cycling] and joined the <street reclamation> movement he thought:
\Q[Paris is a friendly city to walkers, as it is not too large, and does not have too many extremely busy roads, you can basically cross all of it on foot.]
Perhaps compared to <SÃ£o Paulo City>, which is what he knew before that was true. But no, his standards have improved since. Paris has way too many cars. The noise of <internal combustion engine> vehicles is extremely annoying. And because there are too many personal vehicles, cars have to horn a lot to fight for space. Fuck cars. Paris has been making a big cycling push in the early 2020's, and that is great. But it is still far, far from good.
