One day, someone will invent a way to take the <hash> of a piece of hardware and see its history log, like <software engineers> do with <version control>. Until then, this is as close as you can get.

Ciro one day guessed that hardware would certainly be a slang for something naughty, and yup, here we are: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hardware[], drug paraphernelia. <Ciro Santilli's drug experiences>[Read on]!

<LEDs>:
* maximum Continuous Forward Current: 50 mA
* under 20 mA
  * Forward Voltage: 2.0 V typical, 2.5 V max

20 mA appears to be the typical operation. So with the 2.0 V drop on 5 V power we want a resistor such that:
$$
(5 - 2)/r = 20 10^{-3} \implies r = 150
$$

for the max 50 mA we would instead have 60 <Ohms>

Hi there,

I'm trying to buy a spare aluminium extractor filter for an Elica extractor, but I can't find the right size on the website.

Also can't find the second bulb that was likely bought last time, so likely the right one burnt and the other bulb was used for it.

2019-03-06 toilet top lamp left burnt, IKEA 240V 35W GU10. Putting in another one.

2019-03-28 toilet top lamp right burnt, IKEA 240V 35W GU10. Waiting for people to come to look at transformer, there is definitely something wrong.

2019-04-03 top lamps: replaced with LED (LAP GU10 3W) since lower power, transformer not changed. Mirror lamps: transformer changed, left one replaced with Homebase Halogen 20W 12V. When I came back lamps flickering badly and sometimes not turning on, recalled technician.

Some reviews:
* the keyboard is kind of crap. Notably the key "a" is very hard to press!!
* the lack of a sleep state indication LED and "I'm powering on LED" compared to Lenovo is really sad
* it gets way too hot doing work (Monero bootstrap) with lid closed, likely brought system down

<OPSEC>: will run only cryptocurrency wallets and nothing else. Will connect to Internet, but never ever to a non clean USB flash drive.

The <OPSEC> for this machine supposes:
* no supply of chain attack on USB hardware, Laptop hardware, pre-installed Windows and Ubuntu ISO
* connecting with browser to a few well known websites to download stuff (Ubuntu ISO, Monero software) is safe

Bootstrap <OPSEC>:
* turn on from factory, start Windows 11 Home 23H2 build 22631.2715, connect to home Wifi during setup process. Considered skipping WiFi, but I'll want to download the Ubuntu ISO later on anyways https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/bypass-lets-connect-you-to-a-network/2ce188f6-1b28-45a0-97d2-bfccfa3c9188[]. Don't sign in to online Windows account, and turn off all spyware requests.
* on preinstalled Edge browser, download <Ubuntu 24.04> ISO from https://ubuntu.com[], check sha256 with `Get-FileHash` on powershell even though that is pointless https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/1687/does-hashing-a-file-from-an-unsigned-website-give-a-false-sense-of-security[], download balenaEtcher portable from https://etcher.balena.io/ (currently recommended burner at https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop#how-to-install[]) from etc, and burn Ubuntu into a <SanDisk Ultra Flair 64 GB>
* install Ubuntu from USB flash. No internet connection initially, default everything.
* notice that Ubuntu 24.04 is too broken, install <Ubuntu 22.04>.4 on the previously used USB from Ubuntu, and then install 22.04 instead... minimal installation, encrypted ZFS
  * <Ubuntu 24.04 "The application files has closed unexpectedly">. This likely terminated uncompression of the bz2 halfway, and led to a corrupted monerod...
  * https://askubuntu.com/questions/15520/how-can-i-tell-ubuntu-to-do-nothing-when-i-close-my-laptop-lid fix the eternal laptop lid issue without GUI solution...
* copy view only wallet private key by takinga picture of the QR code with Android cell phone. This gives it to the <CIA> immediately, but that's fine as we're going to publish it publicly.
It must have taken about one week running full time to sync the Monero blockchain which at the time was at about 3.1M blocks! I checked on system explorer, and CPU and internet usage was never maxed out, suggesting simply slow network. But the computer still overheated quite a bit and froze a few times.

Bought: November 2023 during Black Friday sale for £1,323.00 to be <Ciro Santilli>'s main personal laptop.

Six years after, and we are 2x on every key spec (except processor Hz ;-) at about 1/2 the price and 1/2 the weight (though smaller 14" screen for greater portability), so not bad! Customized to max out each hardware spec:

Specs:
* Processor: AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 7840U Processor (3.30 GHz up to 5.10 GHz)
* Operating System: No Operating Systemselected upgrade
* Operating System Language: No Operating System Languageselected upgrade

Upon arrival:
* Weight: 1490 g
* Charger weight: 323 g
* Firmware according to `sudo dmidecode -t bios`:
  ``
  Vendor: LENOVO
  Version: R2FET33W (1.13 )
  Release Date: 09/08/2023
  ``

Buy research:
* https://www.phoronix.com/review/thinkpad-p14s-gen4 says Ubuntu running fine
* Intel vs amd: the Intel ones could come with a discrete rtx A500 GPU. GPU likely makes laptop heavier and less power efficient. And both have basically the same benchmark which is crazy:
  * https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=RTX+A500+Laptop+GPU&id=4649
  * https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/gpu.php?gpu=Radeon+780M&id=4818
  So the only downside is not being able to run CUDA.
* thought about Yoga or other Ultrabook options, but 2x price at same specs, so nah...

2020-06-06: dropped some lemon juice on the bottom left of touchpad. Bottom left button not working anymore... I'm an idiot. There are many other alternatives, but very aggravating, I'll replace it for sure. Can't find the exact replacement part or any videos showing its replacement online easliy, dang. For the T430: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3lzV9uXRjU Asked at: https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-P-and-W-Series-Mobile-Workstations/P51-left-bottom-button-below-trackpad-mouse-left-click-stopped-working-possible-to-replace/m-p/5019903 Also I could not access it because you need to remove the HDD first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Klawxc7T_Y and I can't pull it out even with considerable force, unlike in the video... And OMG, those button caps are impossible to re-install once removed!!! Then when I put the whole thing back together, the upper buttons were not working anymore. FUUUUUUUUCK. When first opening I pulled on it without properly removing the cap and it came off, but it didn't look broken in any way and I put it back in. Keyboard works thank God, so right black connector is fine, left white one oppears to be the one for upper keys and trackpoint, both of which stopped working. The hardware manual confirms that they are both part of the same device, so basically a mouse :-) TODO can it be bought separately from te keyboard? Doesn't look like it, photo of keyboard part includes those buttons. The manual also confirms that the bottom buttons are one device with the trackpad "trackpad with buttons", thus forming the second entire mouse.

2022-10-14: stopped being able to connect to Ubuntu 22.04. Was trying to do a UART video demo, connected USB, disconnected, connected, disconnected several times on different filming attempts. Was working some of the time, Ubuntu did recognize it, I even saw UART output for sure, but was a bit unstable. But then at one point it just stopped getting recognized by Ubuntu 100% of the time. The board is still being powered by USB, and the previously flashed program still runs, but nothing showed on `sudo dmesg -w` at all, and I can't reprogram it!

A day later, managed to get tit to connect once more with a different cable, but just once!

The sport backpack has a fatal flaw: no strap to hold laptop in place, wo it just tumbles back and forth as you walk.

Neither of them have very good padding below the laptop, but at least the Elite one has a slightly elevated inner bag which woudl likely help a lot in case of a drop.
