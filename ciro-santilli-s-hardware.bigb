One day, someone will invent a way to take the \x[hash] of a piece of hardware and see its history log, like \x[software-engineer]{p} do with \x[version-control]. Until then, this is as close as you can get.

Ciro one day guessed that hardware would certainly be a slang for something naughty, and yup, here we are: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hardware[], drug paraphernelia. \x[ciro-santilli-s-drug-experiences][Read on]!

Brand on extractor glass: Elica: https://elica.com

Brand on filter itself: "ARMA Filtre a.s." based on markings: http://www.armafiltre.com.tr/uygulamalar/7/3/en/Home-Appliances.html Cannot find any model on website however... looks like Elica's B2B supplier only.

\Q[
Aluminium extractor filter for 208298104403

Hi there,

I'm trying to buy a spare aluminium extractor filter for an Elica extractor, but I can't find the right size on the website.

My 12NC is : 208298104403

My filter looks a lot like this: https://shop.elica.com/en/accessori/filtro-grassi-in-alluminio-cod-GRI0077330A.html but the dimensions are different: I measured 45.9cm x 17.6cm on my old one.

Do you have that for sale?

2021-01: left back bulb burnt, put in another LE GU10 LED Bulbs

2020-11: kitchen extractor left lamp burnt again. Did I forget to report a right side burn earlier, or is there something wrong with the left one? Also can't find the second bulb that was likely bought last time, so likely the right one burnt and the other bulb was used for it. Buying https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00LOBUDSS "4 x Eveready 20 W 12 V G4 Dimmable Halogen Capsule Light Bulbs Pack of 4" for 3.66 pounds. Worked, felt a bit more yellow than the previous one.

2019-01-24, right one burnt a few days ago, old Bell still works. Inner part black, and black dot on the wire. Putting new TopLux again, but this time on the left, old bell on right.

2019-01-24 toilet top lamp also burnt a few days ago, but not at the same time as mirror. Diall, 240V 40W, GU10. Putting in IKEA 240V 35W.

2019-02-02 toilet mirror lamp left (TopLux) burnt. Don't know what to do anymore. Only the magic Bell lamp works.

2019-03-06 toilet top lamp left burnt, IKEA 240V 35W GU10. Putting in another one.

2019-03-28 toilet top lamp right burnt, IKEA 240V 35W GU10. Waiting for people to come to look at transformer, there is definitely something wrong.

2019-04-03 top lamps: replaced with LED (LAP GU10 3W) since lower power, transformer not changed. Mirror lamps: transformer changed, left one replaced with Homebase Halogen 20W 12V. When I came back lamps flickering badly and sometimes not turning on, recalled technician.

2019-04-12 mirror lamp: it was just he connector that was bad, it was changed, also put LEDs there to make it less warm and hopefully have less tear on connector.

2020-06-06: dropped some lemon juice on the bottom left of touchpad. Bottom left button not working anymore... I'm an idiot. There are many other alternatives, but very aggravating, I'll replace it for sure. Can't find the exact replacement part or any videos showing its replacement online easliy, dang. For the T430: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3lzV9uXRjU Asked at: https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-P-and-W-Series-Mobile-Workstations/P51-left-bottom-button-below-trackpad-mouse-left-click-stopped-working-possible-to-replace/m-p/5019903 Also I could not access it because you need to remove the HDD first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Klawxc7T_Y and I can't pull it out even with considerable force, unlike in the video... And OMG, those button caps are impossible to re-install once removed!!! Then when I put the whole thing back together, the upper buttons were not working anymore. FUUUUUUUUCK. When first opening I pulled on it without properly removing the cap and it came off, but it didn't look broken in any way and I put it back in. Keyboard works thank God, so right black connector is fine, left white one oppears to be the one for upper keys and trackpoint, both of which stopped working. The hardware manual confirms that they are both part of the same device, so basically a mouse :-) TODO can it be bought separately from te keyboard? Doesn't look like it, photo of keyboard part includes those buttons. The manual also confirms that the bottom buttons are one device with the trackpad "trackpad with buttons", thus forming the second entire mouse.

2022: saddle and seat post stolen near home. Burn in \x[hell], motherfuckers. Bought a seatpost marked SP342 MICROPOST ALLOY 3 30.4mm. Like this: https://web.archive.org/web/20220208115055/https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Lightweight-Alloy-Micropost-Bike-MTB-Seatpost-25-4mm-Seat-Pin-300m-Long-Silver-/402311713393 but 30.4mm. OK, bought the Park Tool PW-5 15mm pedal wrench tool. Wasn't expensive at all.

TODO understand other markings on receipt: "18 Flourish FS W Sil XS".

The exact specs pages is lost forever. Closest one we've got is the 2020: https://web.archive.org/web/20200927204537/https://www.liv-cycling.com/gb/flourish-2

Seatpost: TODO diameter. Measured in store 30.4mm after original stolen, although 2020 says 30.9. 30.4mm seemed to fit OK, and measuring with ruler gives 30.5/30.6, I don't think a 30.9 can possibly fit.

Trekking bike bought second hand in 2017. Seller confirmed it is this one https://www.kross.pl/en/2012/trans-alp (http://web.archive.org/web/20200426174741/https://www.kross.pl/en/2012/trans-alp[archive]) but male version (now shown clearly on website, but both exist).

2022-04: could not remove pedals with small 10cm wrench, preparing for trip. Took it to mechanic, they removed without any problem with a Park Tool PW-4, and greased. Glad to see it was not stuck. After that, I was able to remove myself with my 10cm non specialized wrench. Considering getting the Park Tool PW-5 instead of PW-4 which is half the price and just a bit less long. OK Bought it.

2022-03: changed chain after it reached the limit. Very slight slippage on gear 6 as usual, but did not seem enough to require changing the cassette, but rebuying it as soon as I find a good price for next chain for sure, rebuying Shimano HG51 8 Speed 11-32t. OMG it is so expensive now, stocks our out everywhere!

Besides that, have been hearing some noises from the seat post that are worrying me... it never ends... rebuying a Brand-X Layback Seatpost 27.2 diameter 350mm length post to debug.

Also getting Shimano SM-SH56 cleat, there was a deal with 3 pairs so getting 3 pairs now.

2021-11: seatpost making noises again... going to try a Brand-X Layback Seatpost 27.2 diameter, which does not have the useless suspension, and has a double bolt system, and sells on wiggle which is a good sign.

2021-11: 3 days after a ride, tire was empty, thought it was vandalism. Inspected, could not see any issues, did a 75km ride, and left a gain, and again it lost air quickly. Opened up tire, and found a thorn of some plant pierced inside, almost invisible from the outside. It also feels like the thorn stuck in place and reduced the rate of air loss, after removing the tube it lost air quite quickly. Could not fully remove thorn, can still feel it with my finger, but too well stuck in tire, but I don't think it is enough to pierce again, I just put a patch set on top of it, and new tube Schwalbe 700C 28'' AV 17, got two of those.

2021-11: trickling noise coming from front wheel. Going to get a new one without the generator which I have use anyways and see if it solves it: https://www.tredz.co.uk/.M-Part-Shimano-Deore-Hub-on-Mavic-A319-700c-Rim-Complete-Wheel_35638.htm M Part Shimano Deore Hub On Mavic A319 700c Rim Complete Wheel.

* https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/6630/my-bike-leans-to-the-right-what-should-i-check

2021-10: changed chain for new one. Found out that the one I bought did not have a quicklink... Also, it did not come in the original package, but in a sealed plastic bag, presumably to reduce shipping costs. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XVQ2O0 have to be more careful next time. Lost the Shimano 500ml bottle, was strapped on back carrier of bike, but not safe enough, and I went through rough terrain. Had seen it fall off once before another time, but very rare. When I noticed, had no idea where it had fallen off and didn't go back for it. Buying:
* https://www.topeak.com/global/en/products/245-Accessories/1093-VERSAMOUNT Topeak Versamount bottle cage mount because this frame only has 1 pair of holes, why...
* https://www.topeak.com/global/en/products/131-Standard-Cages/202-SHUTTLE-CAGE-AL Topeak SHUTTLE CAGE AL water bottle cage
* https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002FOMU3O Science in Sport Clear Drinks Bottle, 800 ml, Transparent, possible official: https://www.wiggle.co.uk/science-in-sport-800ml-water-bottle
Fit perfectly. Luckily \x[amazon] made me buy two Versamounts, because I needed to use one for each bottle, as the holes on the frame were too close to the bottom and made it impossible to fit both otherwise.

2021-09-05: chain reached 0.75, rebuying HG40 8. Also buying second set of break pads, front is gone, and back almost, gonna swap both at once.

2021-08: back side of teeth of seat post wore off, and the seat is rotating vertically. Identification: markings: ELC (maybe middle letter worn off). 27.2 diameter / 350, 350 is the length from Googling. Has a simple shock absorber system and a single pin to attach the seat. OK, something very similar or the same: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N9ZTD22[]. BESNIN Suspension seatpost. Full markings are: HARD MDU INSIDE under seat clamp, these match exactly. Tube markings are a bit different.

2021-08: noticed that there was a stone stuck inside back tire. Luckily didn't puncture. TODO was it in the same place as the previous puncture? Not far from Schwalbe mark. Rebuying... and answering https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/9827/when-should-you-replace-tires-after-getting-a-flat Going to buy Shoe Goo as well to see if it works: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shoe-Goo-Crystal-Permanent-Adhesive/dp/B08P5V9GQV

2021-08-12: after putting new chain on, if I step hard on pedal on 6th gear, by far the most used, it skips. Seems to be the same symptom as 2020-12 when cassette was worn off, as the shifting itself seems fine. https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/8378/difference-between-shimano-hg51-8-speed-cassette-and-shimano-hg50-8-speed-casset says hg51 is compatible, so getting that newer model. 11-34t was much more expensive/less common than 11-32, so getting 11-32. Managed to install it without any problems.

2021-08: bought Shimano HG40 8 speed chain and put it on bike

2021-07:
* rear shift cable snapped inside shifter during rid, same as 2020-10, same symptom that could never index higher tension gears well bought new cable
* chain reached 0.75+
* trie to put front mudgard on, but several problems on this one. The screws needed are wider than those that come. Could keep old ones. But then on top of that, the wires are too long and would need cutting, so keeping the old front mudgard for now, which is working perfectly.

2021-06: Castelli UPF 50+ Light Arm Sleeves (Skins) Large White, 29 \x[pound]{p} https://www.castelli-cycling.com/bg/upf-50-+-light-arm-sleeves/p/451603621P-001[]. Felt really good. Really does not trap much heat, and completely blocks off sun. It makes you develop a small layer of sweat that keeps you cool, cooler than without the sleeves.

2021-06-05: finally removed the old bottom bracket and installed installed the one I had bought a few months back. What triggered this was the clicking noise back again. It appears that the noise got louder with the heat. The clicking noise went away after changing the new bottom bracket. The old bracket seemed fine after inspecting it closely after removal. There was a bit of dirt/earth inside, and some small chippings came out of one side, not sure if from BB or from the frame itself. There are still some other much less loud noises left however, but they are likely a different source, and not a big issue. The clicking noise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXBdPg1LhQU

2021-05: got the first flat tire ever on the back wheel! A perfectly shaped pointed triangular rock slotted perfectly into the thread and managed to perforate the inner tube. Managed to patch it up perfectly on the road, 2 hours away from home! The inside of the tire is basically intact, so I'm going to keep using it. The next day I put back an old intact inner tube I had replaced preemptively earlier on with this new one that was punctured.

2021-04: put on the Bluemels mudgard on the back. It wasn't hard, and their system seems quite easy to adjust. Chain reached 1.0 stretch, gotta get a new one.

2021-03: clicking noise when pedalling strong driving me crazy. Likely bottom bracket: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/41149/something-clicks-while-pedaling or maybe pedal. Re-buying the exact same Shimano BB-UN55 Bottom Bracket - Silver, 68-118: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/224364037969

2021-03: buying mudgard replacement, going for: SKS Bluemels Shiny 45 mm 28" Mudguard Set Silver https://www.deporvillage.net/sks-bluemels-shiny-45-mm-28-mudguard-set-silver 28 pounds with delivery, which looks like the most similar to the old one. Partially choosing that seller because they are the only ones capable of using the precise product name as shown on the SKS website so I'm sure what I'm getting. It does not have flaps though. But flaps fall off and get lost, so fuck it. SKS range: https://www.sks-germany.com/en/products/bluemels-series/

2021-03-07: one of the wires of the rear mudguard broke due to vibrations! It still kind of works, but gotta get a new one.

2021-02-20: replaced new wheel. Worked fine. Also measured chain stretch between 0.5 and 0.75.

2021-02-14: in preparation for wheel switch, also getting https://www.wiggle.co.uk/shimano-m-system-m600-pair-of-brake-blocks Shimano M-System M600 Pair Of Brake Blocks. More precise markings: M70T3 Deore LX, AL (\x[aluminium]) https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/ev/EV-BR-SHOE-ATB2-1414L.pdf Reads: "Performs especially well in wet conditions and may pass DIN standards. Gives off less noise, but the pad is heavier, faster rim wear and tends to fade. "

2021-02-11: tried to put the new wheel in. Made a few discoveries:
* I can't take the cassette out anymore again, even though I put it on myself, and the day I put it on, I took it off once to check if I could, so rebuying Shimano Claris CS-HG50-8 11-34t https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/2252255352[], and if I ever have to take the old one off, I'll take it to the store again
* the tire on the old wheel was on the reverse direction, had been ridden for a very long time like that, and the threads are extremely worn
* after making insane efforts earlier to put the tire on the wheel, and knowing about directionality, when I actually took it down I noticed I had at some point of my suffering swapped sides and put it on the wrong way in......
* I weighted the wheel for fun, assembled with unfilled tire and without the cassette was about 2.5kg

2021-01: ETC Rim Tape 700 40C for the new wheel. No packaging, but possibly: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0063HIIOY

2021-01: moved the saddle forward a bit to 1.8cm was still feeling scapulas before, now seems perfect. Not much effort on hamstrings, but I don't know how to fix both, and not having pain is more important

2020-12: moved the saddle forward back to 2cm, was feeling too much pressure on lower back, and on previous ride, the most tired part of body was behind scapulas, so presumably due to overreach. Felt immediately better.

2020-12-22: felt like rear hub had a bit of friction, can't fix vibration, going to try the buying a new whole wheel:
* https://www.bikeparts.co.uk/products/m-part-shimano-deore-mavic-a319-silver-dt-swiss-p-g-36-hole-rear-wheel Found by Googling same rim as original "Mavic A319". Site markings: WLC503 M PART SHIMANO DEORE / MAVIC A319 SILVER / DT SWISS P/G 36 HOLE 700C HYBRID REAR WHEEL. Cannot find a single website that gives exact rear hub model, but hopefully Deore will match, looks the same. 70 pounds. Does not come with rim tape.
* Schwalbe Men's Marathon Plus Tour Hs404 Performance Line Rigid Tires Size: 700 x 40C. Just going to get the entire thing to have leave a backup wheel.

2020-12-21: put in the new cassette, chainring and chain. Shifting is amazing once again. When pedalling strong on the test run it felt like something on the back hub was vibrating... gotta debug that. Maybe not enough force on closing the cassette?

2020-12-20: tried to replace entire drive chain after over stretched chain destroyed teeth. Chainring and pedals came off nicely, but cassette was stuck, but I took it to the shop and they managed: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/18465/how-can-i-remove-a-stuck-rear-cassette/74041#74041

2020-12: moved saddle back to 2.5cm mark to try and get more hamstring action, but back started hurting. Moved to 2.2cm half way through ride, and it seemed perfect.

2020-12: moved seat post down after https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNGMRtJ5LIc mentioned that saddle too high causes greater asymmetries which I had felt. With \x[dhb-dorica-mtb-shoe-2020-12] with cleats straight on 2-mark. First down 15mm from max, but felt really too low. Then down only 7.5mm, and felt great, possibly better than before.

2020-12: moved \x[2020-04-giro-rumble-vr-off-road-shoe] cleats all the way back, and turned the left one a bit outward to better fit let. Got more tired on hamstrings than on quads now, gotta improve that later on maybe for better balance.

2020-12: put more WD-40 on front shifter. Let it dry, then "WD-40 Bike, All Conditions Lube Bicycle". After next four hour ride, shift to 3rd was still working perfectly. Found the culprit.

Put back the rear mudguard. Wheel not hitting it for now. Lost the extra appended protector thingy, was sure I saw it during installation, so maybe it just fell off during next ride? Can't find it at home. Does not make much different for me, might help others behind me though.

2020-12-05: 4 hour ride, very wet and dirty, on start could get into third perfectly, but at end couldn't anymore!!! So it must have been an issue with lubrication on the bottom shift mechanism.

2020-12-01:
* test rode 3rd gear shift, completely smooth now!
* put back the new saddle Selle Royal Scientia, and inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX3fKolI25Q moved the saddle to 2cm position because I had never felt my hamstrings. It did feel much better! I felt my hamstrigs more, and butt took much longer to get soggy, maybe only around 2 hour mark! Started feeling lower back more though.

2020-11-30:
* fixed the can't get into 3rd gear problem. Did the following:
  * without cable tension, it changed easily
  * sprayed HD40 on shifter and hinges near bottom bracket
  * still didn't shift
  * reduced tension. This made me manage to change to the 3rd. It must be highlighted how sensitive this was to tension. 5 quarter screws on the shifter barrel were the difference between being able to shift or not
  * one more thing Ciro noticed, is that he had possibly previously held up the front gear before attaching the cable, therefore possibly overly tensioning it. It might be better to just instead pull the end of the cable with a pair of pliers to remove slack, but wihtout making the gear move up, that is enough. Then finish tuning on the shifter arrel adjuster
  * then since everything was out and ready, also changed shift cable just in case. The new one had a bit less friction, but not a lot less, so it did not feel like it was what solved the problem
* also better inspected the chainrings. Middle one is visibly worn due to the century old chain, even more so than the teeth of the cassettes on the back.. so here we go again, more Shimano FC-M311: https://www.bikeparts.co.uk/products/shimano-fc-m311-altus-square-taper-chainset-48-38-28t-with-chainguard-175-mm Can't find how to buy just chainring itself.

2020-11-28: can't stand slippage anymore, going to change cassette too, rebuying Shimano Claris CS-HG50-8 11-34t: https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/2252255352 20 pounds

2020-11-26: left hand large gear almost impossibly hard to switch to largest gear. The gear switches on chainring, but it won't click and stay in place, related: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/46172/front-shifter-wont-shift-into-3rd

2020-11-22: put back old saddle, one inch from back, did 6 hour ride, it is more comfortable than new one. Butt was soggy at some points, but much less than new saddle.

2020-11-19: noticed that chain slips if I pedal very strongly, and especially if I try to stand up: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/7928/why-does-my-gear-slip-when-going-uphill-standing Does not happen on the largest chainring. Have to check the smallest one, as it is harder to check there. Took to shop, they said chain worn out with tool measurement, and cassette worn out.

I inspected the cassette myself later on, but it did not appear significantly worn out in my newbie opinion.

2020-11-08: used \x[park-tool-paw-12-adjustable-wrench] and \x[park-tool-bbt-22] to remove bottom bracket to debug noise. After putting everything together, it seemed gone on a very short test ride. The bottom bracket itself seemed fine. There was a bit of dirt, but didn't seem critical. What felt more off was that the drive side cranck arm came off much more easily than the non-drive side one, suggesting it was not tight enough. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPQyQnNdews "Crank Removal and Installation - Three Piece Crankset (Square Spindle, ISIS, Octalink)" by Park Tool (2015) suggests that this is a common cause of noise, so maybe removing the bottom bracket wasn't needed after all this time. But it's done at least.

2020-11-05
* moved saddle backwards a bit to 1 cm mark, was feeling like butt was falling off the back a bit at 0 cm. After this, it felt better, but still a bit mushy after 4 hour ride
* been hearing a clicking noise when pedalling, left foot at about 7 o'clock. Going to open it up.

2020-10-04 bought a new inner shift cable for the rear derailleur from bike shop, bulk without visible branding. The plastic shifter casing screw was stripped, could not get it off. OMG I had done that just yesterday on the road for the diagnosis! How is it possible? So soft!!!! I just proped the plastic open with a flat screw driver and managed to insert the cable. However, the previous problem still remains: I can't get smooth shift to faster gears on the rear.

2020-10-03 was having rear shifting issues for a while, and today it stopped working completely. Opened and noticed that the shift cable had ruptured inside the shifter!!! Related: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/40536/shifter-cable-broke-down-misuse-lack-of-maintenance-shifter-or-regular-occurr This has been only 11 months since last change.

2020-08: buying Selle Royal Scientia M2 saddle: https://www.selleroyal.com/en/scientia-m-2 based on 60 degree riding position and 110mm sitbone distance \x[ciro-santilli-s-body]. Had felt a little bit of pain on butt muscle but it passed. But also noticed that the UNICLO shorts ripped a bit, and it might be due to the terrible state of the saddle. Felt good on first ride around the block. Harder than previous, and narrower. Feels higher quality and better fitting.

2020-06-06: replaced front brake pads with the Jagire ones previously bought (one pair already been put on rear brakes)

2020-04-19: tried to remove left pedal again with \x[2020-04-decareta-pedal-spanner], put more force, and the tool itself actually got dented and started spinning freely around the pedal. I give up, will change crank arm. Can't find just the left crank arm, and not sure if 170/175, so just buying the entire thing: Shimano Altus FC-M311 Crank set 48T/38T/28T with chaingard: https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/si/SI-0094A-001-ENG.pdf | https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/ev/EV-FC-M311-2675A.pdf | https://www.deporvillage.net/shimano-altus-m311-175mm-78-speed-chain-set-483828-black at 175mm which is the correct one for my height as mentioned at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUygkHlcVMQ

2020-04: bought Shimano Deore PD-M324 pedals in preparation for flat to SPD switch: https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/deore-t6000/PD-M324.html[] (https://web.archive.org/web/20200419105148/https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/deore-t6000/PD-M324.html[archive]) | https://www.wiggle.co.uk/shimano-m324-combination-pedals[], since I'll remove the pedals at somepoint anyways, first learnt at: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/30662/can-i-use-normal-shoes-trainers-with-clipless-pedals/30720#30720 can be used with normal shoes too. SPD/plataform double side chosen to so I can both commute with on regular shoes and ride further for sport with SPD shoes. Cleat type: SM-SH56. Praying to God that the thread size is universal as mentioned at: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10162/whats-difference-between-1-2-and-9-16-inch-pedals When they arrived noticed they felt quite heavy! 533g. Let's see. The non double sided is 455g though: https://www.wiggle.co.uk/shimano-m530-mtb-spd-trail-pedals/[]. And a full roadie one like PD-RS500 SPD-SL weights 320g.

2020-04: attempted to use \x[2020-04-decareta-pedal-spanner] to remove left pedal that would not come off with generic short wrench and has been ticking a bit for several months, and now sometimes appears to do false spins! The think must be completely destroyed. Failed, too hard.

2020-04: was trying to remove left pedal with short wrench I had, impossible. Later noticed that the kick up stand was a bit bent! Tried to turn it around, but did not manage to make it improve much. Later during a ride, the new position was too close to the spokes, and started to hit the spokes! When I got home, tried to remove the \x[fucking] kickstand, but it had a flat bolt in a deep place between the rear tubes, and I couldn't do it with my simple wrenches. Went to bike shop next day, and they removed it, likely with a deep wrench. The piece was thrown away.

2020-03: finally installed the new derailleur after long suffering, including new cables and casing on front and back derailleurs and on back brake. Took 3 1-2 hour sessions, but it became amazing.

2020-03: screw on left shifter (yes, the bloody screw) broke when trying to open it to take out cable. Buying left and right since the right one was broken from previous fall. https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B073XQ8J78 SHIMANO ST-EF65-8 EZI FIRE STI SHIFTERS 24 SPEED (3 x 8), 25 pounds https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/ev/EV-ST-EF65-9R4-3257B.pdf

2020-01-13: Parked on city center, shitty low diagonal place, crowded. When came back, bike on floor, had dropped hard since front wheel twisted on axis, untwisted with leg. When got home, noticed that right gear shifter was half coming off. Later found out that the piece broken on one of the screws, hanging only by the other screw. Next day morning, noticed that the bell had come off, and was lost, went back on evening but obviously could not find it.

2019-07-26: the front crank was sometimes making loud cracking noises when I pedalled hard. Then, after two weeks, it also started making very loud screeching noises, and then finally I couldn't pedal anymore, and I took it to the shop.

2019-06-30: fill tires, using 90PSI, was TODO

Tick on back wheel stopped. Back brake did not get better. Gears not improved. Rust remained, was told too hard to remove, and not on teeth, so should not matter.

2018-09-02: spoke https://www.dtswiss.com/en/products/spokes-nipples/spokes/dt-champion/ + minor brake work 41 pounds full work

2018: front tire blew up and was replaced by TODO.

Bottom bracket: TODO, have a picture after it broke later on and was removed by shop, but did not catch full markings, visible: JIS DIN EN-14777. JIS stands for Japanese Industry Standard (JIS), related: https://www.velodrome.shop/square-taper-jis/iso/

Saddle: completely destroyed when he decided to identify it for replacement in 2020. Website said "Selle Royal Freedom Royalgel". Markings (badly worn out): "yalgel", freeDom inscribed on saddle, so that's it.

Frame markings: Trekking (two stylized trees on left, one with two triangles and the other 3 triangles), Frame Size: M. Feels more or less the right size for me. Maybe L would be better, as my butt tends to go off the back of the saddle, which I always cranck to the most backward position possible. Markings under bottom bracket: on metal: LY2B 016042 KROSS EN1746. On a sticker, badly worn off: K828130 2?Z018 0004.

Gear shifters: don't know exact model since could not find markings (\x[fuck] you Shimano?) but from photos online, seems to be one of the ST-EF* family EZ FIRE, e.g. https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/dm/DM-ST0001-05-ENG.pdf[ST-EF65-8] or ST-EF500.

Back wheel: quick release.

Crankset: markings "Shimano", "FC-M311", "Hyperdrive", "Dual SiS index", from Google part of Altus: https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/ev/EV-FC-M311-2675A.pdf (https://web.archive.org/web/20180219080226/https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/ev/EV-FC-M311-2675A.pdf[archive]). There are two possible tooth counts, I counted 48T on largest, so it is the 48/38/28 one. There are two arm sizes though, 170mm vs 175mm, not sure which one mine is, very hard to measure, I think it was 170mm.

2021-11: buying a Cateye ViZ450 https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/safety_lights/TL-LD820/ 51 dollars after CatEye RAPID X2 was stolen. Unfortunately, it is not very compatible with my Topeak saddle bag... the attachment is to wide to fit the saddble bag, and even if it did it is slanted to account for seat tube slant so it would not be very verfical. Arghh, they have futher options on the website: https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/parts/5342460/ that is the one I need, Clip C-2 or Clip C-1N. On Amazon it didn't have clear choices for that... mine came with the BracketSP-15. Ah, can buy on Amazon for 3 dollars, OK then.

Lost 2021-11 in a big city, didn't know the path well, had to cross a bunch of streets, was on back of back bag, likely stolen.

I glued it with some superglue, but two months later found it leaked into my "oils bag", so I threw it away... it must have penetrated through the super glue.

2019-08: "CatEye CA475RAPMIN Rapid Mini Rear Lights and Reflectors, Black" stolen: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01I4193PY (https://web.archive.org/web/20190829232804/https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01I4193PY[archive]). Very good quality. Those USB rechargeable lights you just have got to take off with you whenever parked in town or else \x[drug-addict]{p} will steal them because they are easy to remove for recharging. Tempted to just stick to dynamo ones that are screwed in. Re-bought original back light: AXA Basta, was a bit different from previous one, cannot take in lamps anymore, even though there is the plastic casing for them! Just not metal / wires.

2021-12:

2021-01: "Endura FS260-NEMO Glove II" Neoprene Winter Handwarmer Large. https://www.endurasport.com/Gants-Nemo-FS260-Pro-II/p/E1216-Black Let's see how neoprene feels like. Basically it becomes wet with your transpiration, but is still relatively warm, would take it well down to 5C. Likely would work well with heavy \x[rain]. Not bad. But does feel a bit cooler than the Extremities XDRY, especially after you walk for a bit, and your hand becomes cold, and it is very hard to warm it because it is also wet.

2020-12-21: "dhb Neoprene Nylon Overshoes" https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-neoprene-nylon-overshoes large black. After 2 rides, noticed that the front lower part of left foot (the one I put on and off the most) had a hole in it, not sure where it was made. Edit: I later noticed that it is because I have the reflex of braking slightly with my shoes in certain conditions, e.g. at lower speeds in close proximity to pedestrians, the sounds of which also serve as a way to alert them without the need for a loud bell. But it destroys the overshoe, so I have to undo that reflex.

2020-11-06 https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/castelli-perfetto-ros-long-sleeve-cycling-jersey/ "Castelli Perfetto RoS Long Sleeve - Cycling jersey" size L Large. On Wiggle: https://www.wiggle.co.uk/castelli-perfetto-ros-long-sleeve-jersey Feels great. Together with the dhb Merino Long Sleeve Base Layer, I can gown down to 0 Celcius, no problem. Breathes great, blocks wind and rain reasonably, and can holds mild rain out on a short 1.5h ride without problem.

2020-10-17:
* last ride top was a bit cold on shoulders where not covered by arm warmers, about 10C, so going to try: https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-aeron-rain-defence-polartec-jacket-1 "dhb Aeron All Winter Softshell Jacket", 109.25 pounds, Fluro Yellow, small to match previous tops that worked, approx: 50 polyester, 40 polyamide, 10 elastane, recommended temperature: 2-12 degrees Celcius. Material felt OK, not amazing but OK. Returned because a bit too small.
* the "dhb Classic Thermal Bib Tights" is a bit too warm for lower tens, so going to try "dhb Aeron FLT Roubaix Bib Tight", 85.50 pounds, medium, navy color, recommended temperatures:  6-14 deg C, 84% polyamide, 16% elastane. Hopefully not being marked as "thermal" means it is less warm. Also hopefully being DHB Aeron it will be a bit less baggy behind knees. Returned later because felt indistinguishable from the "dhb Classic Thermal Bib Tights".

2020-11: Castelli Thermoflex 2 Arm Warmers, Large, 28 pounds: https://www.wiggle.co.uk/castelli-thermoflex-2-arm-warmers | https://www.castelli-cycling.com/gb/men/accessories/cycling-leg-and-arm-warmers/p/451953020A-010 advertized 8°-20°C. Was going to buy the DHB ones for 10 pounds less, but always out of so Castelli it is.

2020-08: started getting getting cold, so let's do it:
* https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-lightweight-mesh-long-sleeve-base-layer "dhb Lightweight Mesh Long Sleeve Base Layer", small, 93% polyester 7% Elastane. Felt a little bit tight on first try, but I think I'll keep it, it might be correct, it's hard to say, and it's not worth my time. If it is too bad I'll just get another one later.

  Extremely light and transparent. Holds down to lower 10's, but if it's windy a bit less so. Feels good.
* https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-classic-thermal-bib-tights "dhb Classic Thermal Bib Tights", medium, 86% polyamide, 14% elastane, 56 pounds. Very slightly tight, but felt right on first try. Some similar URLs https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-classic-thermal-bib-tights-1 | https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-thermal-bib-tight

  Pretty warm, for lower 10's and under only. Mid 10's is too much. Slightly bulky behind the knees when you bend. But good quality otherwise.
* https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-extreme-weather-neoprene-overshoe "dhb Extreme Weather Neoprene Overshoe", large, 81% polyamide, 18% polyurethane. Wanted to buy https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-neoprene-nylon-overshoes which is lighter, but was out of stock. The material felt good, but it did not fit with \x[2020-04-giro-rumble-vr-off-road-shoe], I should have checked better, maybe it is only for road shoes.

  Incompatible with \x[2020-04-giro-rumble-vr-off-road-shoe], so returned it. That shoe is too large.

2020-05 https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-4/ dhb Aeron Short Sleeve Jersey 100% polyester, Red Large. This one fit OK. Length feels right. When on cycling position, a bit baggy under arms though, but guessing M would be too short? Still already feels less baggy than the cheap muddy fox jersey. Aeron is the second lowest level of DHB top, after the super basic 25 pound one. Material is thin polyester, could be better, but OK.

2020-05 https://www.wiggle.co.uk/castelli-perfetto-light-2-short-sleeve-jersey/ Castelli Perfetto Light 2 Short Sleeve Jersey 84% Nylon, 16% Lycra. When it arrived, was WAY too small, so returned. Material looked and felt amazing.

2019-12 https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-merino-long-sleeve-base-layer-1/?sku=5360752872 "dhb Merino Long Sleeve Base Layer", black, small, was right size, wool is a bit itchy, but does feel like it dries off more quickly on long rides than the cheap Muddy Fox polyester cycling Jersey. Pretty warm, too much for 15C.

2019-12 https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-aeron-winter-weight-merino-sock/?sku=100335580 dhb Aeron Winter Weight Merino Sock, blue, UK 9.5-12. Did not seem to make much of a difference, feet still cold, not wet.

Grey color, red inner butt padding. 2020-08: after using it a lot, noticed that the padding stiches started to come off a bit.

2018 (?) Extremities XDRY gloves Looks like: https://www.sportsdirect.com/extremities-wp-p/line-glove-91-907293 (https://web.archive.org/web/20200419133931/https://www.sportsdirect.com/extremities-wp-p/line-glove-91-907293[archive]) Gets wet after a few minutes of medium \x[rain]. But does dry quickly. Baggy, multilayer. Says 40 pounds, but always at 20 pound discount, so it is just a marketing trick.

= dhb Dorica MTB Shoe (2020-12)
{parent=cycling-clothes}

https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-dorica-mtb-shoe

Black EUR 44, 1 smaller than \x[ciro-santilli-s-body][normal size] as recommended by website.

Bought SM-SH56 cleat to accompany.

When it arrived, it felt a bit too long, around 2cm maybe free space after toe, and when I walk and the front part touches ground, heel comes off a bit, which is annoying. But I was too lazy to give it back and take the risk of a second try, also it felt correctly tight on sides. During first test ride it felt good.

It is slightly water proof. But if it rains a lot, it will get soaking wet. And once it does get wet, it feels like it is very very hard to dry, there don't seem to be any holes underneath.

= 2020-04 Giro Rumble VR Off Road Shoe
{parent=cycling-clothes}

2021-01-28: used this show for the first time after wearing \x[dhb-dorica-mtb-shoe-2020-12] exclusively for a while. It felt much much more comfortable, the Dorica is too narrow. Also this one is much more recessed, and walking with it is much easier. Also, I notice that the intentional asymmetry I had put on cleats is not necessary anymore now that my saddle height is not way too high

At 5C feet are too cold. Compatible overshoes are basically impossible to find: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/73589/what-kind-of-overshoes-can-i-use-with-a-large-touring-spd-cycling-shoe-such-as-t

It is not possible to do long walks with this, unlike some websites suggests, especially on hard surfaces like rock, that would be very dangerous because the cleat area will slip. But it is good for shorter walks on grass/mud, and that does open up some good short walk exploration possibilities compared to a road shoe.

Color "Black/Red 20" (but it's actually orange), size 46 https://www.wiggle.co.uk/giro-rumble-vr-off-road-shoe (https://web.archive.org/web/20180816224711/https://www.wiggle.co.uk/giro-rumble-vr-off-road-shoe[archive]). Manual says to use Loctite 243 medium strength, first 2.4 Nm bolt torque to test it out and find good position, and then final bolt torque 5-6 Nm unless cleat says less. Starting with Shimano SM-SH56 cleats (https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/si/SI-41R0G-003-ENG.pdf[archive]), which also says provisional torque 2.5 Nm, tightening torque 5-6 Nm.
