Given enough computational power per dollar, AGI is inevitable, but it is not sure certain ever happen given the end of <Moore's law>[end of Moore's Law].

Alternatively, it could also be achieved genetically modified biological brains + <brain in a vat>.

Imagine a brain the size of a building, perfectly engineered to solve certain engineering problems, and giving hints to human operators + taking feedback from cameras and audio attached to the operators.

This likely implies <transhumanism>, and <mind uploading>.

<Ciro Santilli> joined the silicon industry at one point to help increase our computational capacity and reach AGI.

Ciro believes that the easiest route to full AI, if any, could involve <Ciro's 2D reinforcement learning games>.

= Principles of AGI
{parent=Artificial general intelligence}

= The missing link between continuous and discrete AI
{parent=Principles of AGI}

<Ciro Santilli> has felt that perhaps what is missing in 2020's <AGI> research is:
* the interface between:
  * the continuous/noisy level (now well developed under <artificial neural network> techniques of the 2010's)
  * and <symbolic AI> level AI
  The key question is somewhat how to extract symbols out of the space-time continuous experiences.
* more specialized accelerators that somehow interface with more generic <artificial neural networks>. Notably some kind of speialized processing of spacial elements is obviously hardcoded into the brain, see e.g. <grid cell>{full}

Forcing these boundaries to be tested was one of the main design goals of <Ciro's 2D reinforcement learning games>.

In those games, for example:
* when you press a button here, a door opens somewhere far away
* when you touch certain types of objects, a chemical reaction may happen, but not other types of objects
Therefore, those continuous objects would also have "magic" effects that could not be explained by "simple" "what is touching what" ideas.

= Intelligence is hierarchical
{parent=Principles of AGI}

This point is beautifully argued in lots of different sources, and is clearly a pillar of <AGI>.

Perhaps one may argue that our <deep learning> layers do form some kind of hierarchy, e.g. this is very clear in certain models such as <convolutional neural network>. But many of those models cannot have arbitrarily deep hierarchies, which appears to be a fundamental aspect of intelligence.

<How to Create a Mind>:
\Q[The lists of steps in my mind are organized in hierarchies. I follow a routine procedure before going to sleep. The first step is to brush my teeth. But this action is in turn broken into a smaller series of steps, the first of which is to put toothpaste on the toothbrush. That step in turn is made up of yet smaller steps, such as finding the toothpaste, removing the cap, and so on. The step of finding the toothpaste also has steps, the first of which is to open the bathroom cabinet. That step in turn requires steps, the first of which is to grab the outside of the cabinet door. This nesting actually continues down to a very fine grain of movements, so that there are literally thousands of little actions constituting my nighttime routine. Although I may have difficulty remembering details of a walk I took just a few hours ago, I have no difficulty recalling all of these many steps in preparing for bed - so much so that I am able to think about other things while I go through these procedures. It is important to point out that this list is not stored as one long list of thousands of steps - rather, each of our routine procedures is remembered as an elaborate hierarchy of nested activities.]

<Human compatible>: TODO get exact quote. It was something along: life goal: save world from hunger. Subgoal: apply for some grant. Sub-sub-goal: eat, sleep, take shower. Sub-sub-sub-goal: move muscles to get me to table and open a can.

{c}
{parent=History of AGI research}

Due to the failures of earlier generations, which believed that would quickly achieve <AGI>, leading to the <AI winters>, 21st researchers have been very afraid of even trying it, rather going only for smaller subste problems like better neural network designs, at the risk of being considered a <crank (person)>.

While there is fundamental value in such subset problems, the general view to the final goal is also very important, we will likely never reach AI without it.

This is voiced for example in <Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom (2014)> section "Opinions about the future of machine intelligence" which in turn quotes Nils Nilsson:
\Q[
There may, however, be a residual cultural effect on the AI community of its earlier history that makes many mainstream researchers reluctant to align themselves with over-grand ambition. Thus Nils Nilsson, one of the old-timers in the field, complains that his present-day colleagues lack the boldness of spirit that propelled the pioneers of his own generation:
\Q[
Concern for "respectability" has had, I think, a stultifying effect on some AI researchers. I hear them saying things like, "AI used to be criticized for its flossiness. Now that we have made solid progress, let us not risk losing our respectability." One result of this conservatism has been increased concentration on "weak AI" - the variety devoted to providing aids to human
thought - and away from "strong AI" - the variety that attempts to mechanize human-level intelligence
]
Nilssonâ€™s sentiment has been echoed by several others of the founders, including Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, and Patrick Winston.

He has some good explanations of that, and one major focus of the project is their semi open source spiking neuron simulator <BrainSimII>.

There is also an intermediate area of research/engineering where people try to first simulate the robot and its world realistically, use the simulation for training, and then transfer the simulated training to real robots, see e.g.: <realistic robotics simulation>.

<Ciro Santilli> defines an "AI game" as:
\Q[a game that is used to train AI, in particular one that was designed with this use case in mind, and usually with the intent of achieving <AGI>, i.e. the game has to somehow represent a digital world with enough analogy to the real world so that the AGI algorithms developed there could also work on the real world]

Most games played by AI historically so far as of 2020 have been AI for games designed for humans, notably:
* board games such as <chess> and <go (game)>
* <video games> such as <Minecraft> or old <video game console> games

<Ciro Santilli> took a stab at an AI game: <Ciro's 2D reinforcement learning games>, but he didn't sink too much/enough into that project.

The key takeaway is that setting an explicit <value function> to an <AGI> entity is a good way to destroy the world due to poor <AI alignment>. We are more likely to not destroy by creating an AI whose goals is to "do want humans what it to do", but in a way that it does not know before hand what it is that humans want, and it has to learn from them. This approach appears to be known as <reward modeling>.

Some other cool ideas:
* a big thing that is missing for AGI in the 2010's is some kind of more hierarchical representation of the continuous input data of the world, e.g.:
  * <intelligence is hierarchical>
  * we can group continuous things into higher objects, e.g. all these pixels I'm seeing in front of me are a computer. So I treat all of them as a single object in my mind.
* <game theory> can be seen as part of <artificial intelligence> that deals with scenarios where multiple intelligent agents are involved
* <probability> plays a crucial role in our everyday living, even though we don't think too much about it every explicitly. He gives a very good example of the cost/risk tradeoffs of planning to the airport to catch a plane. E.g.:
  * should you leave 2 days in advance to be sure you'll get there?
  * should you pay an armed escort to make sure you are not attacked in the way?
* <economy>, and notably the study of the <utility>, is intrinsically linked to <AI alignment>

Good points:
* <Post mortem connectome extraction with microtome>
* the idea of a singleton, i.e. one centralized power, possibly AGI-based, that decisivly takes over the planet/reachable universe
* <AGI research has become a taboo in the early 21st century> section "Opinions about the future of machine intelligence"
