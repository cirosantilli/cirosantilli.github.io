The conditions are always impossible.</blockquote></div></div><div class="p" id="_7">For example, when <a href="ciro-santilli">Ciro Santilli</a> was deciding what to do in university, he wanted mostly to do pure <a href="physics">physics</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_8">But because he was afraid he was going to die poor and unemployed because of that, he picked engineering instead.</div><div class="p" id="_9">That was a mistake.</div><div class="p" id="_10">His family was not even poor. He was young and did not have a family to support. His father even told him: "do whatever the <a href="biology#sexual-intercourse">fuck</a> you want, we support your decision".</div><div class="p" id="_11">But he was a coward.</div><div class="p" id="_12">It was also in part because a <a href="physicist">physicist</a> uncle which he respected suggested that as an engineer Ciro might be able to make useful contributions to tooling required by physics. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Salmeron">Roberto Salmeron</a> died in 2020, Ciro's friends shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqDLN3qT2w">this 2013 video interview</a> with the late professor, where he explains he first went to the <a href="university#university-of-sao-paulo">University of São Paulo</a> to study engineering (like Ciro), but then fell for his passion for physics (like Ciro?), his first task being to build a <a href="system-of-units#geiger-counter">Geiger counter</a>, thus explaining the likely origin of the uncle's theory. But who knows, maybe he was right. Maybe Ciro's <a href="ourbigbook-com">OurBigBook.com</a> will become huge and help a lot of people, and it might not have had Ciro not done engineering and learnt programming. Destiny operates in weird ways sometimes.</div><div class="p" id="_13">Furthermore, while in University, Ciro learnt about the <a href="education#molecular-sciences-course-of-the-university-of-sao-paulo">molecular Sciences Course of the University of São Paulo</a>, a fantastic sounding full time course that any student could transfer to called that teaches various <a href="ourbigbook-com#motivation">natural sciences topics which Ciro loves (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology)</a> and which students from the entire university can apply to transfer to only after joining the university, with the guarantee that they can go back to their original courses if they didn't adapt to the new course.</div><div class="p" id="_14">But did Ciro do it? Nope, he remained an even larger coward.</div><div class="p" id="_15">Had he studied more sciences, he might have been happier, and might have had greater achievements later in life, in particular when he went to <a href="ecole-polytechnique">École Polytechnique</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_16">Maybe not, but now this doubt will never leave his mind until the final day.</div><div class="p" id="_17">Similar thoughts crossed his mind when he started his <a href="the-most-important-projects-done-by-ciro-santilli#ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china">campaign for freedom of speech in China</a>, but this time he had learnt the lesson, and went for it, and it felt very good.</div><div class="p" id="_18">If you have a day job, but also have a dream, and want to keep the day job for a reason, try to reserve the time of the day that your brain works best before or after work for your dream: <a href="#do-one-cool-thing-every-day">do one cool thing every day</a>.</div><div class="p" id="_19">Companies can help you grow because you see real problems from within them, but their end goal is to consume you as much as possible. Don't let that happen. Invest part of what you gain, in yourself. <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/paradox-going-outside/">www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/paradox-going-outside/</a> The Paradox of Going Outside by <a href="software#james-somers">James Somers</a> (2012) puts it incredibly well:<div><blockquote id="_20"><div class="p" id="_21">I work, for instance, as a Web developer. It's a very good job. Our office is a block south of Union Square, a 12-minute commute from my apartment. We're served breakfast every morning. Our kitchen is stocked with "provisions" of organic beef jerky, coconut water, craft beers, chips, and two restaurant-class espresso machines. We have two ping pong tables and buckets of 3-star ping pong balls. (A new office manager bought "1-stars" once and some of the guys protested by crushing them.) We work on 4-cored Apple Mac computers with dual monitors. We have an unmolested hour for lunch, 10-minute breaks in the morning and afternoon, and a "do not disturb" policy past the working hours. We even have a specific email address where employees can ask for free things: genuine maple syrup, hot chocolate, a $900 chair, a new keyboard. Most of the programmers make six figures, and many of those have only three or four years of experience.</div><div class="p" id="_22">It's impossible to say so without sounding like the spokesperson for Entitlement itself but working there is still sort of soul-crushing. It's soul-crushing in the way that any job that doesn't command your full passionate attention must be. What happens is that I will be in my chair in the early afternoon and I will accidentally step out of myself and all I'll see is time passing, nine-hour parcels of healthy consciousness forever being packed away as the user experience of clerical workers or consumers or whoever gets marginally better; and I'll end up thinking that this enterprise of mine is not so much creative but bureaucratic, that what I've gotten good at is reading the instruction manuals of other people, finding my way around their insignificant warrens. And in those moments the whole business will seem to me like kind of a tragic waste.</div></blockquote></div></div><div class="p" id="_23">Other quotes:<div class="list"><ul id="_24"><li id="_25"><div><blockquote id="_26">Healthy Disregard For The Impossible</blockquote></div>is a phrase <a href="google#sergey-brin">Sergey Brin</a> uses. <a href="google#the-google-story">The Google Story</a> claims he picked that up from <a href="education#academia">academia</a>, and quotes this from a september 2003 talk in an <a href="continent#israel">Israeli</a> elite high school.</li><li id="_27"><a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/29/find-love/">quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/29/find-love/</a><div><blockquote id="_28">Find What You Love and Let It Kill You</blockquote></div></li><li id="_29"><a href="cryptocurrency#caroline-ellison">Cute boy things by Caroline Ellison</a>:<div><blockquote id="_30">if you are a boy with the confidence to advocate for unconventional ideas and take actions based on them you are valid</blockquote></div></li><li id="_31"><a href="brain#how-can-i-be-as-great-by-justine-musk">How can I be as great by Justine Musk</a>:<div><blockquote id="_32">rock the boat</blockquote></div></li><li id="_33">From the 1922 poem <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Portugu%C3%AAs">Portuguese Sea</a> by famous <a href="continent#portugal">Portuguese</a> poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Pessoa">Fernando Pessoa</a>, which gets drilled into the head of every <a href="brazil">Brazilian</a> <a href="education#secondary-school">high school</a> student:<div><blockquote id="_34"><div class="p" id="_35">He who wants to pass beyond the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Bojador">Bojador</a><br>Must go beyond pain.</div><div class="p" id="_36">Quem quer passar além do Bojador<br>Tem que passar além da dor.</div></blockquote></div></li><li id="_37">Translation of a poem by <a href="continent#muhammad-iqbal">Muhammad Iqbal</a> TODO date:<div><blockquote id="_38"><div class="p" id="_39">Said one gazelle to another, "I will Take shelter in the harem from now on; For there are hunters at large in the wild, And there is no peace here for a gazelle.

Sample transcription: <a href="https://genius.com/Alan-watts-what-if-money-was-no-object-annotated">genius.com/Alan-watts-what-if-money-was-no-object-annotated</a>:<div><blockquote id="_51"><div class="p" id="_52">What do you desire? What makes you itch? What sort of a situation would you like?</div><div class="p" id="_53">Let's suppose, I do this often in vocational guidance of students, they come to me and say, well, "we're getting out of college and we have the faintest idea what we want to do". So I always ask the question, "what would you like to do if money were no object? How would you really enjoy spending your life?"</div><div class="p" id="_54">Well, it's so amazing as a result of our kind of educational system, crowds of students say well, we'd like to be painters, we'd like to be poets, we'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows you can't earn any money that way. Or another person says well, I'd like to live an out-of-doors life and ride horses. I said you want to teach in a riding school?</div><div class="p" id="_55">Let's go through with it. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something, which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him, you do that and forget the money, because, if you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time. You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don't like doing, which is stupid. Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way.</div><div class="p" id="_56">And after all, if you do really like what you're doing, it doesn't matter what it is, you can eventually turn it - you could eventually become a master of it. It's the only way to become a master of something, to be really with it. And then you'll be able to get a good fee for whatever it is. So don't worry too much. That's everybody is - somebody is interested in everything, anything you can be interested in, you will find others will.</div><div class="p" id="_57">But it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like, in order to go on spending things you don't like, doing things you don't like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See what we are doing, is we're bringing up children and educating to live the same sort of lives we are living. In order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing, so it's all retch and no vomit. It never gets there. And so, therefore, it's so important to consider this question: What do I desire?</div></blockquote></div></figcaption></figure></div><div class="figure"><figure id="video-keep-chargin-from-a-show-of-hands-by-victor-wooten-1996" class="multiline"><div class="float-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HPeL9R2_5hI" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><figcaption><a href="#video-keep-chargin-from-a-show-of-hands-by-victor-wooten-1996"><span class="caption-prefix">Video 3. </span></a><div class="title">Keep Chargin' from a Show of Hands by Victor Wooten (1996)</div> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPeL9R2_5hI">Source</a>. <div><blockquote id="_58">That's the way I live my life, I give it my all.
