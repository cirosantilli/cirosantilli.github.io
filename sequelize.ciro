Some usage examples under: \x[sequelize-example]{full}.

As of 2021, this library is extremely painful to use. It does feel semi-mature, but there are just too much horrible things going on;
* the documentation is a bit messy and misses a lot of stuff. The examples are often too short, and it is hard to understand what specific options they are talking about do because they lack clear input/expected output pairs. Examples:
  * https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/5385#issuecomment-324479607
  * https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/1775#issuecomment-360028396
* the implementation has several inelegant/unintuitive annoyances/requirements of code repetition that drive you mad.

  The association API feels notably bad, it took a few days for \x[ciro-santilli] to learn to do what he considers "basic" association operations, knowledge which he dumped to: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22958683/how-to-implement-many-to-many-association-in-sequelize/67973948#67973948

  See also: \x[how-to-decide-if-an-orm-is-good].
* bugs are piling up. It appears that many key devs left, and current maintainers are just not being able to keep up.

  And they have setup a stupid bot that closes every thread automatically after a few days, what's the point... valid bugs are being closed due to this, and it is impossible to distinguish what is solved and what isn't since everything gets closed.

Some glaring issues are listed at \x[the-horrors-of-sequelize].

* foreign keys are capitalized:
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55273091/why-use-the-uppercase-key-when-creating-association-model-in-sequelize 
  * https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/5828
* you must give `foreignKey` when using aliases, otherwise it fails subtely. That would be derived automatically.
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41502699/return-flat-object-from-sequelize-with-association can't auto-flatten to reuse the database's `ORDER`

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34059081/how-do-i-reference-an-association-when-creating-a-row-in-sequelize-without-assum hard to not duplicate foreign keys values everywhere

* cannot change columns when other columns have constraints due to the backup table?
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64533732/process-of-changing-a-table-with-sequelize-migration-if-foreign-key-constraint-i

* `.id` gets added to `SELECT` no matter what, breaking `GROUP BY` unless you do horrible workarounds:
  * https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/3256
  * https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/5481
* they don't seem to have a simple built-in mechanism for transaction retries? \x[sequelize-transaction-retry]{p}.
* impossible to do subqueries in general. Docs just tell you to use literals. This in particular prevents single query deletes with join as done at \a[nodejs/sequelize/raw/many_to_many.js]:
  * https://sequelize.org/master/manual/sub-queries.html[]: the docs actually just tell you to use literals, lol
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45354001/nodejs-sequelize-delete-with-nested-select-query
  Also, you can't get query strings either: https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/2325
* SQLite `changeColumn` migrations do on delete cascades of other tables. SQLite does not have change column statements, so they have to drop and recreate tables, but they don't temporarily remove cascades, so you lose data.
* migrations
  * no way to do (non-raw) queries during migrations, e.g. to update fields based on other fields in a complex way?

= Sequelize example
{parent=sequelize}

To run examples on a specific database:
* `./index.js` or `./index.js l`: \x[sqlite]
* `./index.js p`: \x[postgresql]. You must manually create a database called `tmp` and ensure that peer authentication works for it
All examples can be tested on all databases with:
``
cd sequelize
./test
``

Overview of the examples:
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/index.js]: a bunch of basic examples
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/raw/index.js]: raw query \x[hello-world]. Ideally one should never use a raw query in a real project. We use raw examples mostly as a \x[sql] tutorial under \x[sql-example], and will not comment on them much further on this section.
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/count.js]: a simplified single-table count example. In practice, this will be usually done together with \x[join-sql] queries across multiple tables. Answers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22627258/how-does-group-by-works-in-sequelize/69896449#69896449
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/date.js]: automatic date typecasts
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/camel_case.js]: trying to get everything in the database camel cased, columns starting with lowercase, and tables starting with uppercase. The defaults documented on getting started documentation do uppercase foreign keys, and lowercase non-foreign keys. It's a mess.
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/ignore_duplicates.js]: ignore query on unique violation with `ignoreDuplicates: true` which does \x[sqlite] `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO` or \x[postgresql] `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`

  Also testing in the same file the closely related `updateOnDuplicate`:

  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55531860/sequelize-bulkcreate-updateonduplicate-for-postgresql
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/inc.js]: demonstrate the `increment` method. In \x[sqlite], it produces a statement of type:
  ``
  UPDATE `IntegerNames` SET `value`=`value`+ 1,`updatedAt`='2021-11-03 10:23:45.409 +00:00' WHERE `id` = 3
  ``
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/sync_alter.js]: illustrates `Model.sync({alter: true})` to modify a table definition, answers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54898994/bulkupdate-in-sequelize-orm/69044138#69044138

* \a[nodejs/sequelize/update.js]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54898994/bulkupdate-in-sequelize-orm/69044138#69044138
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/updateOnDuplicate.js]
* \a[nodejs/sequelize/validation.js]: is handled by a third-party library: https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js[]. They then add a few extra validators on top of that.

= Sequelize parallel example
{parent=sequelize-example}

= nodejs/sequelize/parallel_select_and_update.js
{file}
{parent=sequelize-parallel-example}

This example is the same as \x[file/nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_select_and_update.js], but going through \x[sequelize] rather than with raw queries. `NONE` is not supported for now to not have a transaction at all because lazy.

The examples illustrates: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55452441/for-share-and-for-update-statements-in-sequelize

Sample invocation:
``
node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./parallel_select_and_update.js p 10 100 READ_COMMITTED UPDATE
``
where:
* `READ_COMMITTED`: one of the keys documented at: https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/transaction.js~Transaction.html which correspond to the standard \x[sql-isolation-level]{p}. It not given, don't set one, defaulting to the database's/sequelize's default level.
* `UPDATE`: one of the keys documented at: https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/transaction.js~Transaction.html#static-get-LOCK[]. Update generates a `SELECT FOR UPDATE` in \x[postgresql] for example. If not given, don't use any `FOR xxx` explicit locking.

Other examples:
* `node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./parallel_select_and_update.js p 10 100 READ_COMMITTED UPDATE`

Then, the outcome is exactly as described at: \x[file/nodejs/sequelize/raw/parallel_select_and_update.js]:
* `READ_COMMITTED`: fails
* `READ_COMMITTED UPDATE`: works
* `REPEATABLE_READ`: works, but is a bit slower, as it does rollbacks

  This case also illustrates \x[sequelize-transaction-retry]{p}, since in this transaction isolation level transactions may fail:
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68427796/sequelize-transaction-retry-doenst-work-as-expected
  * https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/1478
  * https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/8294

= Sequelize transaction retry
{parent=sequelize}

Transaction retries are inevitable, as some \x[sql-isolation-level]{p}

Doesn't seem to have any simple built-in mechanism?
