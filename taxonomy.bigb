COVID happens in two stages:
* viral infection
* \x[inflammatory] phase, where the body takes over, and sometimes harms itself. It seems that people are not generally contagious at this point?

This distinction is one of the reasons why separating the virus name (SARS-CoV-2) from the disease makes sense: the disease is much broader than the viral infection.

= Why it takes several days to enter inflammatory phase in COVID-19?
{parent=covid-19}
{wiki}

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7247969/

Why is it there such a clear separation of phases?

Why do people with mild symptoms go on to die? It is a great mystery.

\x[ciro-santilli]'s theory is that COVID is extremely effective at avoiding \x[immune-response]. Then, in people where this is effective, things reach a point where there is so much virus, that the body notices and moves on to take a more drastic approach. This is compatible with the virus killing older people more, as they have weaker immunes systems. This is however incompatible with the fact that people don't seem to be contagious after the viral phase is over...

At only 65 bp, this gene is quite small and boring. For a more interesting gene, have a look at the next gene, \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-gene-thra].

Does something to do with \x[threonine].

This is the first in the sequence thrL, thrA, thrB, thrC. This type of naming convention is quite common on related adjacent proteins, all of which must be getting \x[transcribed-biology] into a single \x[rna] by the same \x[promoter-genetics]. As mentioned in the analysis of the \x[kegg] entry for \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-gene-thra], those A, B and C are actually directly functionally linked in a direct \x[metabolic-pathway].

We can see that thrL, A, B, and C are in the same \x[transcription-unit] by browsing the list of \x[promoter-genetics]{p} at: https://biocyc.org/group?id=:ALL-PROMOTERS&orgid=ECOLI[]. By finding the first one by position we reach; https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?object=TU0-42486[].

The second \x[gene] in the \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655] genome. Part of the \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-operon-thrlabc].

Part of a reaction that produces \x[threonine].

This \x[protein] is an \x[enzyme]{parent}. The \x[uniprot] entry clearly shows the \x[chemical-reaction]{p} that it \x[catalyses]. In this case, there are actually two! It can either transforming the \x[metabolite]:
* "L-homoserine" into "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde"
* "L-aspartate" into "4-phospho-L-aspartate"
Also interestingly, we see that both of those reaction require some extra energy to catalyse, one needing \x[adenosine-triphosphate] and the other \x[nadp-plus].

TODO: any mention of how much faster it makes the reaction, numerically?

Since this is an \x[enzyme], it would also be interesting to have a quick search for it in the \x[kegg] entry starting from the organism: https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco01100+M00022 We type in the search bar "thrA", it gives a long list, but the last entry is our "thrA". Selecting it highlights two pathways in the large \x[graph], so we understand that it catalyzes two different reactions, as suggested by the protein name itself (fused blah blah). We can now hover over:
* the \x[edge-graph]: it shows all the enzymes that catalyze the given reaction. Both edges actually have multiple enzymes, e.g. the L-Homoserine path is also catalyzed by another enzyme called metL.
* the \x[node-graph]: they are the \x[metabolite]{p}, e.g. one of the paths contains "L-homoserine" on one node and "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde"
Note that common \x[cofactor-biochemistry]{p} are omitted, since we've learnt from the UniProt entry that this reaction uses ATP.

If we can now click on the L-Homoserine edge, it takes us to: https://www.genome.jp/entry/eco:b0002+eco:b3940[]. Under "Pathway" we see an interesting looking pathway "Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism": https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260+b0002 which contains a small manually selected and extremely clearly named subset of the larger graph!

But looking at the bottom of this subgraph (the UI is not great, can't Ctrl+F and enzyme names not shown, but the selected enzyme is slightly highlighted in red because it is in the URL https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260+b0002[] vs https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260[]) we clearly see that thrA, thrB and thrC for a sequence that directly transforms "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde" into "Homoserine" to "O-Phospho-L-homoserine" and finally to\x[threonine]. This makes it crystal clear that they are not just located adjacently in the genome by chance: they are actually functionally related, and likely controlled by the same transcription factor: when you want one of them, you basically always want the three, because you must be are lacking \x[threonine]. TODO find transcription factor!

The UniProt entry also shows an interactive browser of the \x[tertiary-structure] of the protein. We note that there are currently two sources available: \x[x-ray-crystallography] and \x[alphafold]. To be honest, the \x[alphafold] one looks quite off!!!

By inspecting the \x[fasta] for the entire genome, or by using the \x[ncbi-open-reading-frame-tool], we see that this gene lies entirely in its own \x[open-reading-frame], so it is quite boring

From the \x[fasta] we see that the very first three \x[codon]{p} at position 337 are
```
ATG CGA GTG
```
where `ATG` is the \x[start-codon], and CGA GTG should be the first two that actually go into the protein:
* CGA: \x[arginine]
* GTG: \x[valine]

https://ecocyc.org/gene?orgid=ECOLI&id=ASPKINIHOMOSERDEHYDROGI-MONOMER[] mentions that the enzime is most active as \x[protein-complex] with four copies of the same protein:
\Q[Aspartate kinase I / homoserine dehydrogenase I comprises a \x[protein-dimer][dimer] of ThrA dimers. Although the dimeric form is catalytically active, the binding equilibrium dramatically favors the tetrameric form. The aspartate kinase and homoserine dehydrogenase activities of each ThrA monomer are catalyzed by independent domains connected by a linker region.]

Has one of the smallest genomes known, and \x[jcvi] made a minimized strain with 473 genes: \x[jcvi-syn3-0].

The reason why genitalium has such a small genome is that <parasites tend to have smaller DNAs>. So it must be highlighted that genitalium can only survive in highly enriched environments, it can't even make its own <amino acids>, which it normally obtains fromthe host cells! And because it cannot do <cellular respiration>, it very likely replicates slower than say <e coli>. It's easy to be small in such scenarios!

<Power, Sex, Suicide by Nick Lane (2006)> section "How to lose the cell wall without dying" page 184 has some related mentions puts it well very:
\Q[One group, the Mycoplasma, comprises mostly parasites, many of which live inside other cells. Mycoplasma cells are tiny, with very small genomes. <M. genitalium>, discovered in 1981, has the smallest known genome of any bacterial cell, encoding fewer than ïµï°ï° genes. Despite its simplicity, it ranks among the most common of sexually transmitted diseases, producing symptoms similar to Chlamydia infection. It is so small (less than a third of a micron in diameter, or an order of magnitude smaller than most bacteria) that it must normally be viewed under the <electron microscope>; and difï¬culties culturing it meant its signiï¬cance was not appreciated until the important advances in gene sequencing in the early 1990s. Like Rickettsia, Mycoplasma have lost virtually all the genes required for making <nucleotides>, <amino acids>, and so forth. Unlike Rickettsia, however, Mycoplasma have also lost all the genes for oxygen respiration, or indeed any other form of membrane respiration: they have no cytochromes, and so must rely on <fermentation> for energy.]

Downsides mentioned at https://youtu.be/PSDd3oHj548?t=293[]:

Etymology: means "single hole" in \x[greek-language], because like other \x[reptile]{p} it has a single hole for \x[shit], \x[pee] and \x[fucking]: the \x[cloaca].

Every mammal except the weird \x[monotreme]{p}, i.e. \x[marsupial]{p} and the \x[placentalia].

The name is completely random, "wild beast". Are platypuses not "wild beasts"? They have a freaking poison!!

They split up from the rest of the \x[mammal]{p} after the \x[monotreme]{p}.

Every other mammal has a \x[placenta].

This baby in pouch thing just feels like a pre-\x[placenta] stage.

= Borlotti beans
{parent=plant}
{wiki=Cranberry_bean}

This looks a lot like the beans that \x[brazilian]{p} venerate and can be easily found in the \x[united-kingdom] as of 2020.

The more exact type seems to be \x[pinto-bean], but this is close enough.

2021-03: same but 2.5 teaspons, seems to be the right ammount.

2021-02-10: attempt 3: 500g 1 hour 30 minutes no pressure, uncontrolled water. Salt with one chorizo: put 3 teaspoons, it was a bit too much, going to do 2 next time and see.

2020-12-14: attempt 3: 250g of beans, 1.5l of water, 30 minutes pressure.

2020-11-30: attempt 2: 275ml of dry beans, about 50% of 500g bag, putting 1650 ml (6x) of water on pressure cooker Still had to throw out some water.

Density dry raw: 216 g/250 ml = 432 g / 500 ml = 500 g / 580 ml = 864 g/L

500 g dry expands to in water after 12 hours: 1200 ml

Therefore 500 g dry = 864 / 2 L = 432 ml expands about 3x.

Therefore, to the maximum 2.5L of the cooker with 8x https://www.oliviascuisine.com/brazilian-style-beans/[dry volume water from this recipe] I can use:
``
2500 = volume expanded bean + volume water = 3 volume dry bean + 8 volume dry bean = 11 volume dry bean
``
and so:
``
volume dry bean = 2500/11 = 227ml
``
which is about 227 / 580 = 40% of the 500 g bag.

After first try, I found that 8x volume of water is way, way too much. Going to try 6x next time.

= Pinto bean
{parent=plant}

This seems to be the "brown \x[brazilian] bean" that many Brazilians eat every day.

Edit: after buying it, not 100% sure. This one felt smaller than what Ciro had in Brazil, \x[borlotti-beans] might be closer. Pinto beans are smaller, and creamier, and have softer peel, possibly produced less \x[fart][natural gas].

2021-04: second try.

2021-03: did for first time, started with same procedure as \x[borlotti-beans] 2021-03. Maybe 1h30 is too much. Outcome was still very good.
