But since then, a question has loomed over the entire debacle. How were the Chinese able to roll up the network?</blockquote></div>and:<div><blockquote id="_62">U.S. intelligence officers were also able to identify digital links between the covert communications system and the U.S. government itself, according to one former official—links the Chinese agencies almost certainly found as well. These digital links would have made it relatively easy for China to deduce that the covert communications system was being used by the CIA. In fact, some of these links pointed back to parts of the CIA’s own website, according to the former official.</blockquote></div>Although no clear mention of websites is made in that article, the fact that there were "links" back to the CIA website strongly suggests that the communication was done through websites.</div><div class="p" id="_63">The report also reveals that there was a temporary "interim system" that new sources would use while they were being vetted, but that it used the same style of system as the main system. It would be cool if we managed to identify which sites are interim or not somehow:<div><blockquote id="_64"><div class="p" id="_65">When CIA officers begin working with a new source, they often use an interim covert communications system—in case the person turns out to be a double agent.</div><div class="p" id="_66">The communications system used in China during this period was internet-based and accessible from laptop or desktop computers, two of the former officials said.</div><div class="p" id="_67">This interim, or “throwaway,” system, an encrypted digital program, allows for remote communication between an intelligence officer and a source, but it is also separated from the main communications system used with vetted sources, reducing the risk if an asset goes bad.</div><div class="p" id="_68">Although they used some of the same coding, the interim system and the main covert communication platform used in China at this time were supposed to be clearly separated.</div></blockquote></div></div><div class="figure"><figure id="image-illustration-of-the-foreign-policy-article"><div class="float-wrap"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180902002821im_/https://foreignpolicymag.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/eagle-china-new-size_rougher-sm.jpg?w=1536&amp;h=1024&amp;crop=0,0,0,0"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20180902002821im_/https://foreignpolicymag.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/eagle-china-new-size_rougher-sm.jpg?w=1536&amp;h=1024&amp;crop=0,0,0,0" loading="lazy" height="315"></a></div><figcaption><a href="#image-illustration-of-the-foreign-policy-article"><span class="caption-prefix">Figure 3. </span></a><div class="title">Illustration of the Foreign Policy article</div>. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/08/15/botched-cia-communications-system-helped-blow-cover-chinese-agents-intelligence">Source</a>. </figcaption></figure></div><div class="p" id="_69"><b>November 2018</b>: Zach Dorfman and Jenna McLaughlin reported for Yahoo News the first clear report that the communication system was made up of websites at: <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html">"The CIA's communications suffered a catastrophic compromise.

Teams of CIA experts worked feverishly to take down and reconfigure the websites secretly used for these communications</blockquote></div></div><div class="p" id="_71">The usage of of Google dorking is then mentioned:<div><blockquote id="_72">In fact, the Iranians used Google to identify the website the CIA was using to communicate with agents.</blockquote></div>It seems to us that this would have been very difficult on the generically themed websites that we have found so far. This suggests the existence of a separate recruitment website network, perhaps the one reported in 2011 by Iran offering VISAs. It would be plausible that such network could link back to the CIA and other government websites. Recruited agents would only then later use the comms network to send information back. The target countries may have first found the recruitment network, and then injected double agents into it, who later came to know about the comms network. TODO: it would be awesome to find some of those recruitment websites!</div><div class="p" id="_73">Another very interesting mention is the platform had been over extended beyond its original domain application, which is in part why things went so catastrophically bad:<div><blockquote id="_74">Former U.S. officials said the internet-based platform, which was first used in war zones in the Middle East, was not built to withstand the sophisticated counterintelligence efforts of a state actor like China or Iran. “It was never meant to be used long term for people to talk to sources,” said one former official. “The issue was that it was working well for too long, with too many people.

For many case officers — that is, the CIA's primary corps of spy handlers — this is a core part of their professional identity.</div><div class="p" id="_117">During the roll-up in China, for instance, a former U.S. official told me about a CIA officer who, aware that something was going terribly wrong there, organized final, assuredly dangerous, in-person meetings with agency sources. This distraught CIA officer essentially shoved wads of cash into sources' hands. This CIA officer warned them of the unfolding disaster and begged them to leave the country as fast as they could. Another source told me a story about a CIA official who, while being debriefed in Langley about the asset roll-up — and the slapdash COVCOM system — broke down in tears upon hearing that sources’ lives had been destroyed because of such obvious dereliction, of which they were previously unaware.</div></blockquote></div><div><blockquote id="_118"><div class="p" id="_119">But I don’t want to oversell this point, either.

[...] I had a conversation once with a former senior CIA official with experience in Iran issues who had an almost naturalistic view of recurring asset losses there over the years: for him, it was a built-in, cyclical feature of the work and environment, like the denuding of deciduous forests every fall.</div></blockquote></div></div><h2 id="_ancestors"><a href="#_ancestors"><span class="fa-solid-900 icon"></span> Ancestors <span class="meta">(13)</span></a></h2><div class="list"><ol><li><a href="../cia-2010-covert-communication-websites#background">Background</a></li><li><a href="../cia-2010-covert-communication-websites">CIA 2010 covert communication websites</a></li><li><a href="../science#central-intelligence-agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a></li><li><a href="../science#american-intelligence-agency">American intelligence agency</a></li><li><a href="../science#united-states-intelligence-community">United States Intelligence Community</a></li><li><a href="../science#intelligence-community">Intelligence community</a></li><li><a href="../science#secret-service">Secret service</a></li><li><a href="../science#espionage">Espionage</a></li><li><a href="../science#war">War</a></li><li><a href="../science#social-science">Social science</a></li><li><a href="../science#scientific-method">Scientific method</a></li><li><a href="../science">Science</a></li><li><a href=".."><span title="Home" class="fa-solid-900 icon"></span> Home</a></li></ol></div><h2 id="_synonyms"><a href="#_synonyms"><span title="Synonyms" class="fa-solid-900 icon"></span> Synonyms <span class="meta">(1)</span></a></h2><div class="list"><ul><li><a href="../cia-2010-covert-communication-websites#timeline-of-public-disclosures">Gathering key points from the articles</a></li></ul></div>
