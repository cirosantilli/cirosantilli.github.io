The good songs stopped before of just after \x[ciro-santilli] was born, they were originally heard by his parent's generation. Those young new kids are boring.

* 1968 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67hqRm1qFw[Panis et Circenses] track from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic%C3%A1lia:_ou_Panis_et_Circencis[Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis (1968)] album composed by Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso and performed by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os_Mutantes[Os Mutantes]

* \x[caetano-veloso] is arguably \x[ciro-santilli]'s favorite MPB artist, he has just too many amazing songs.
  * 1968 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmK9GylXRh0[Alegria, Alegria] from the epynomous album https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caetano_Veloso_(1968_album)[Caetano Veloso (1968)]. Critique of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship_in_Brazil[the Dictatorship].
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transa_(album)[Transa (1972)] album (literally: "The Fuck", good old seventies)
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cs2L70ZfVTI[Triste Bahia]. Inspired by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira[Capoeira] music.
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7StPm3ynBU[Mora na Filosofia]
  * 1972 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlmZIazQLJw[Você Não Entende Nada] performed by Caetano Veloso in album https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caetano_e_Chico:_Juntos_e_Ao_Vivo[Caetano e Chico: Juntos e Ao Vivo (1972)], originally by (TODO album, https://www.discogs.com/Gal-Costa-Legal-Voc%C3%AA-N%C3%A3o-Entende-Nada/release/5872459[Discogs] says Legal (1970), but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_(Gal_Costa_album)[wiki page] and photos of back disagree)
  * 1972 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGC0gJAHIYs[Partido Alto]. Composed by Chico Buarque, but Caetano's interpretation takes it to another level
  * 1975 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualquer_Coisa[Qualquer coisa] album
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=796yP7HX9L0[Qualquer Coisa]
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbXembjZ-cE[Samba e Amor], cover from original song by Chico Buarque album https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chico_Buarque_de_Hollanda_-_N%C2%BA4[Chico Buarque de Hollanda - Nº4]. Desperately reminds Ciro of his University day \x[weekend] nights. Except that there was no Samba. And little Amor. Mostly a silent and wholesome loneliness and \x[games-young-ciro-santilli-played][emulation]
    * other notable ones from the album:
      * Georde de Capadócia. A song based on a https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corpo_fechado[corpo fechado]-style song. This idea is much linked to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfd9j6XFmSg[Capoeira]/African religion idea.
  * 1976 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HpqgwC30Zg[Um Índio] from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doces_B%C3%A1rbaros[Doces Bárbaros (1976)] album, and also appeared in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicho_(album)[Bicho (1977)] album

    {title=Coricos' prayer scene from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_God,_White_Devil[Black God, White Devil] (1964)}
  * 1977 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSqU6vgs3Dc[Tigresa] from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicho_(album)[Bicho (1977)] album. Ciro once knew one.
  * 1978 album https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muito_(Dentro_da_Estrela_Azulada)[Muito (Dentro da Estrela Azulada)]
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii2CKWHJQI8[Sampa] Slang for São Paulo. Perfectly captures the city, and reminds Ciro so badly of \x[university-of-sao-paulo][his University days there].
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMsSrxGwW8U[Terra]. Ciro used to watch a television show about nature in the legendary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Cultura[TV Cultura] with his parents in the couch when he was young, Those days were the best. TODO what was the show exactly? Here is a sample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNwfYEMdrRU Very likely just a translation of some British nature series with a custom \x[brazilian] intro and presenter. Credits at end mention English narrator: Eugene Fraser, and Thirteen WNET Nature production, which produced https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(TV_program)[Nature (1982)] that ran since 1982.
  * 1980 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ra8DHnO2cc[Menino do Rio] apparently from 1980 and served as inspiration for the https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menino_do_Rio[Menino do Rio (1980)] movie, which is silly but fun
  * 1984 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CuWgaJMg0U[O quereres] from the https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vel%C3%B4[Velô (1984)] album
* \x[chico-buarque]. Ciro's second favorite.

* \x[gilberto-gil]. Good selection: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ac%C3%BAstico_MTV_-_Gilberto_Gil[Acústico MTV - Gilberto Gil (1994)]. Perhaps Ciro likes him third because he is the most lighthearted one, although not always.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carlos_(singer)[Roberto Carlos] makes Ciro cringe. The only bearable one is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ19CelONfQ[] As Curvas da Estrada de Santos (1969) (The curves of Santos road), which talks about going down to Ciro's beloved \x[santos-sao-paulo-brazil] from the city of \x[sao-paulo], which lies on a plateau of about 700 meters above sea level, a trip that takes you down through the spectacular https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serra_do_Mar[Serra do Mar]. Ciro did this many times on bus when he was \x[ciro-santilli-s-formal-education][studying at the university of São Paulo] and going back home for the weekend from time to time.

This incredibly foul mouthed band was incredibly funny.

\x[ciro-santilli] was a bit young to understand the songs at the time, but the older boys were singing them, and he sang along. So maybe there is a nostalgia factor in play.

But it can't be just that. They are just too funny and brutal, even when Ciro re-listens to it as of 2020.

Many \x[brazilian] \x[religious] cranks in were really happy when their plane crashed and killed all of them in 1996.

Official \x[youtube] channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPmfP5LNbxYwlN0k6C3F_6w

Best songs:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz7101ulkK0[Pelados Em Santos (1995)]. Not too amazing, they only try to be funny by making fun of the North-Eastern accent of Brazil, which is considered somewhat funny in \x[sao-paulo-state], and they fail at being funny.

  But it talks about \x[santos-sao-paulo-brazil], Ciro's idolized city, so let's hear it. They didn't live in Santos apparently, but being from \x[sao-paulo-city], they would have been familiar with that popular local beach location.

= The Holy Trinity of popular brazilian music
{parent=popular-brazilian-music-musician}

In \x[ciro-santilli]'s view, the following three artists form a \x[holy-trinity] of \x[popular-brazilian-music]:
* \x[caetano-veloso]
* \x[chico-buarque]
* \x[gilberto-gil]

\x[elis-regina] is not far though.

Ciro remembers quite clearly when he was riding the car with \x[ciro-santilli-s-parents][his parents] when he pre teen, and he could not understand why they seemed so obseessed with The Trinity et al. They had picked it up of course from the 70's and 80's when they were younger.

Young Ciro would also always confuse who was whom from the three of them.

Then Ciro got older, and he understood, they are \x[mind-blowing]. You do have to look back in time a bit though, lots of lukewarm stuff on later periods. The \x[military-dictatorship-in-brazil] was good for music.

Mostly interpreter of songs written by others. But she's just too amazing, many of her interpretations are better than the original.

\x[god], even \x[ciro-santilli] is slightly shocked by her death, which happened before he was born, can you imagine it at the time? She was MPB's golden girl...
