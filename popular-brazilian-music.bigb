The good songs stopped before of just after <Ciro Santilli> was born, they were originally heard by his parent's generation. Those young new kids are boring.

The place to start is definitely <the Holy Trinity of popular brazilian music>:
* <Caetano Veloso> is arguably <Ciro Santilli>'s favorite MPB artist, he has just too many amazing songs, best ones at: <The best Caetano Veloso songs>{full}
* <Chico Buarque>. Ciro's second favorite.
* <Gilberto Gil>. Perhaps Ciro likes him third because he is the most lighthearted one, although not always: <The best Gilberto Gil songs>{full}

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carlos_(singer)[Roberto Carlos] makes Ciro cringe. The only bearable one is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ19CelONfQ[] As Curvas da Estrada de Santos (1969) (The curves of Santos road), which talks about going down to Ciro's beloved <Santos, São Paulo, Brazil> from the city of <São Paulo>, which lies on a plateau of about 700 meters above sea level, a trip that takes you down through the spectacular https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serra_do_Mar[Serra do Mar]. Ciro did this many times on bus when he was <Ciro Santilli's formal education>[studying at the university of São Paulo] and going back home for the weekend from time to time.

This incredibly foul mouthed band was incredibly funny.

<Ciro Santilli> was a bit young to understand the songs at the time, but the older boys were singing them, and he sang along. So maybe there is a nostalgia factor in play.

But it can't be just that. They are just too funny and brutal, even when Ciro re-listens to it as of 2020.

Many <Brazilian> <religious> cranks in were really happy when their plane crashed and killed all of them in 1996.

Official <YouTube> channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPmfP5LNbxYwlN0k6C3F_6w

Best songs:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz7101ulkK0[Pelados Em Santos (1995)]. Not too amazing, they only try to be funny by making fun of the North-Eastern accent of Brazil, which is considered somewhat funny in <São Paulo (state)>, and they fail at being funny.

  But it talks about <Santos, São Paulo, Brazil>, Ciro's idolized city, so let's hear it. They didn't live in Santos apparently, but being from <São Paulo City>, they would have been familiar with that popular local beach location.

= The Holy Trinity of popular brazilian music
{parent=Popular brazilian music musician}

In <Ciro Santilli>'s view, the following three artists form a <Holy Trinity> of <popular Brazilian music>:
* <Caetano Veloso>
* <Chico Buarque>
* <Gilberto Gil>

<Elis Regina> is not far though.

Ciro remembers quite clearly when he was riding the car with <Ciro Santilli's parents>[his parents] when he pre teen, and he could not understand why they seemed so obseessed with The Trinity et al. Ciro in particular remembers listening to <video Refazenda by Gilberto Gil (1975)>. They had picked it up of course from the 70's and 80's when they were younger.

Young Ciro would also always confuse who was whom from the three of them.

Then Ciro got older, and he understood, they are <mind blowing>. You do have to look back in time a bit though, lots of lukewarm stuff on later periods. The <military dictatorship in Brazil> was good for music.

  Ciro used to watch a television nature show called "Planeta Terra" in the legendary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Cultura[TV Cultura] with his parents in the couch when he was young, and under a duvet when it was a bit cold. Those days were the best.

  TODO what was the original show exactly? Here is a sample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNwfYEMdrRU Very likely just a translation of some British nature show with a custom <Brazilian> intro and presenter. Credits at end mention English narrator: "Eugene Fraser", and "Thirteen WNET Nature" production, which produced https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(TV_program)[Nature (1982)] that ran since 1982, making that a likely candidate.
