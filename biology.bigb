A cool thought: <bacteria> like <E. Coli> replicate every 20 minutes. A human replicates every 15 years. So how can <multicellular> beings possibly cope with the speed of evolution of parasites?

The answer is that within us, the <adaptative immune system> is a population of cells that <evolves> very quickly. So in a sense, within our bodies there is fast cell-level non-inheritable evolution happening daily!

They have several interesting multiagent game ideas.

Claims <Unity>-based, so has the downside of relying on a non-<FOSS> engine.

Ciro became mildly jealous of this channel when he found out about it, because at 800k subscribers at the time, the creator is likely able to make a living off of it, something which Ciro thought impossible.

As of 2022 he was at 1.6M followers with only 17 videos! Of course, much of those videos is about the software and they require infinite development hours to video time ratios.

Much of this success hinges a large part on the amazing 3D game presentation.

Well done!

To make things better, the generically named channel is also the title of one of the best films of al time: <Primer (2004)>.

<Ciro Santilli> supports full legalization of all drugs, because he feels that it would be better overall for the world to have cheaper drugs and more <drug addicts>, but way, way less <organized crime>.

These should be extremely controlled of course, with extremely high <taxes> that puts their price just below the current illegal market, and a complete ban on any positive <advertising>.

Ciro believes that maybe the <government> could even go as far as giving free drugs to <drug addicts> so they don't have to <theft>[rob] to get a fix.

This is notably considering that drug-led organized crime completely dominates and corrupts the <politics> of many production and trafficking zones, which are already generally poor <fucked> up places to start with:
* <Mexican drug war>
* <Golden Crescent>
* <Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)>
Ciro's experiences in Brazil such as mentioned at <SÃ£o Remo, the favela next to USP>, although much less extreme than the above, also come to mind.

Drug traffic corrupts everything. It prevents development of honest people. It is a <cancer>, which we have failed time and time a gain to cure. The only cure is to accept the other less insidious of addiction.

Bibliography:
* <How to Fix a Drug Scandal (2020)> gives a good sense of the relentlessness of the drug war, and how it affects people who are already poor the most
