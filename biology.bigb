= DNA detection
{c}
{parent=dna}

DNA detection means determining if a specific DNA sequence is present in a sample.

This can be used to detect if a given species of microorganism is present in a sample, and is therefore a widely used diagnostics technique to see if someone is infected with a virus.

You could of course do full \x[dna-sequencing][DNA Sequencing] to see everything that is there, but since it is as a more generic procedure, sequencing is more expensive and slow.

The alternative is to use a \x[dna-amplification] technique.

= DNA amplification
{c}
{parent=dna}
{wiki}

DNA amplification is one of the key DNA technologies:
* it is one of the main ways in which \x[dna-detection] can be done.
* it is the first step of \x[illumina][Illumina sequencing], since you need multiple copies of several parts of the genome for the method to work

= Polymerase chain reaction
{parent=dna-amplification}
{title2=PCR}
{wiki}

This is an extremely widely used technique as of 2020 and much earlier.

If allows you to amplify "any" sequence of choice (TODO length limitations) between a start and end sequences of interest which you synthesize.

If the sequence of interest is present, it gets amplified exponentially, and you end up with a bunch of DNA at the end.

You can then measure the DNA concentration based on simple light refraction methods to see if there is a lot of DNA or not in the post-processed sample.

Even \x[ciro-santilli] had some contact with it at: \x[oxford-nanopore-river-bacteria]{full}, see: \x[oxford-nanopore-river-bacteria/pcr]{child}!

One common problem that happens with PCR if you don't design your primers right is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_dimer

= Real-time polymerase chain reaction
{parent=polymerase-chain-reaction}
{wiki}

Also known as: Quantitative PCR (qPCR).

Like PCR, but the amplification machine measures the concentration of DNA at each step.

This describes one possible concentration detection method with \x[fluorescence][fluorescent] molecules that only become fluorescent when the DNA is double stranded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYBR_Green_I[SYBR Green])

\Video[http://youtube.com/watch?v=YhXj5Yy4ksQ]
{title=Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) - Quantitative PCR (qPCR) by Applied Biological Materials (2016)}

This allows you to predict the exact initial concentration by extrapolating the exponential curve backwards.

TODO: vs non-real-time PCR. Why can't you just divide by 2 for every heating step to reach back the original concentration? Likely the reaction reach saturation at an unknown step.

TODO: vs non-real-time PCR in medical diagnostics: do you really need to know concentration for diagnostics? Isn't it enough to know if the virus is present or not?

= Isothermal DNA amplification techniques
{parent=polymerase-chain-reaction}

Isothermal means "at fixed temperature".

This is to contrast with the more well established \x[polymerase-chain-reaction], which requires heating and cooling the sample several times.

The obvious advantage of isothermal methods is that their machinery can be simpler and cheaper, and the process can happen faster, since you don't have to do through heating and cooling cycles.

= Loop-mediated isothermal amplification
{parent=isothermal-dna-amplification-techniques}
{title2=LAMP}
{wiki}

Like PCR, but does not require thermal cycling. Thus the "isothermal" in the name: iso means same, so "same temperature".

Not needing the thermo cycling means that the equipment needed is much smaller and cheaper it seems.

{parent=dna-sequencing}
{wiki}

Experiments that involve sequencing bulk DNA found in a sample to determine what species are present, as opposed to sequencing just a single specific specimen. Examples of samples that are often used:
* river water to determine which bacteria are present, notably to determine if the water is free of dangerous bacteria. A concrete example is shown at: \x[oxford-nanopore-river-bacteria]{child}{full}.
* sea water biodiversity: http://ocean-microbiome.embl.de/companion.html
* \x[food], including searching for desirable microorganisms such as in cheese or bread \x[yeast]
* \x[poo], e.g. to study how the human microbiome influences health. There are companies actively working on this, e.g.: https://www.microbiotica.com/

The by far dominating DNA sequencing company of the late 2000's and 2010's due to having the smallest cost per base pair.

Illumina actually bought their 2010's dominating technology from a \x[cambridge] company called \x[solexa].

To understand how Illumina's technology works basically, watch this video: \x[video-illumina-sequencing-by-synthesis].

\Video[http://youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8]
{title=Illumina Sequencing by Synthesis by \x[illumina] (2016)}
{id=video-illumina-sequencing-by-synthesis}

The key innovation of this method is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumina_dye_sequencing#Bridge_amplification[bridge amplification step], which produces a large amount of identical DNA strands: \x[image-bridge-amplification].

\Image[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Cluster_Generation.png/960px-Cluster_Generation.png]
{id=image-bridge-amplification}
{title=Illustration of the bridge amplification step of Illumina's DNA sequencing.}

This step is genius because sequencing is basically a noise to signal problem, as you are trying to observe individual tiny nucleotides mixed with billions of other tiny nucleotides.

With bridge amplification, we group some of the nucleotides together, and multiply the signal millions of times for that part of the DNA.

This is one of the prime examples of \x[europe]'s decline.

Instead of trying to dominate the sequencing market and gain trillions of dollars from it, they local British early stage investors were more than happy to get a 20x return on their small initial investments, and sold out to the Americans who will then make the real profit.

And now Solexa doesn't even have its own \x[wikipedia] page, while Illumina is set out to be the next \x[microsoft]. What a disgrace.

Here are some good articles about the company:
* http://www.bio-itworld.com/2010/issues/sept-oct/solexa.html (https://web.archive.org/web/20190411005034/http://www.bio-itworld.com/2010/issues/sept-oct/solexa.html[archive]).

Cambridge visitors can still visit the https://pantonarms.co.uk/[Panton Arms pub], which was the location of the legendary "hey we should talk" founders meeting, chosen due to its proximity to the chemistry department of the \x[university-of-cambridge].

In 2021 the founders were awarded the \x[breakthrough-prize]. The third person awarded was Pascal Mayer. He was apparently at Serono Pharmaceutical Research Institute at the time of development. They do have a wiki page unlike Solexa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serono[]. They paid a 700 million fine in 2005 in the \x[united-states], and sold out in 2006 to \x[merck] for 10 billion USD.

= De novo DNA synthesis
{parent=dna}
{wiki=De_novo_synthesis}

As of 2018, \x[ciro-santilli] believes that this could be \x[the-next-big-thing] in \x[biology] technology.

"De novo" means "starting from scratch", that is: you type the desired sequence into a computer, and the synthesize it.

The "de novo" part is important, because it distinguishes this from the already well solved problem of duplicating DNA from an existing DNA template, which is what all our cells do daily, and which can already be done very efficiently \x[in-vitro] with \x[polymerase-chain-reaction].

Many \x[startup] companies are attempting to create more efficient de novo synthesis methods:
* https://twistbioscience.com/
* https://www.evonetix.com/technology/
* http://dnascript.co/
* https://www.ansabio.com/
* https://www.nuclera.com/

Notably, the dream of most of those companies is to have a machine that sits on a lab bench, which synthesises whatever you want.

TODO current de novo synthesis costs/time to delivery after ordering a custom sequence.

The initial main applications are likely going to be:
* \x[polymerase-chain-reaction] primers (determine which region will be amplified
* creating a custom sequence to be inserted in a \x[plasmid], i.e. \x[artificial-gene-synthesis]
but the real pipe dream is building and bootstraping entire \x[artificial-chromosome]{p}

* wash everything

Is it easy to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfection[transfect] a cell with the synthesized DNA, and get it to generate full infectious viral particles?

Consider the \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-operon-thrlabc].

* thrL + thrA + thrB + thrC all together, the transcription unit is called thrLABC: https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?type=OPERON&object=TU00178

The reason for this appears to be that there is a \x[rho-independent-termination] region after thrL. But then under certain conditions, that must get innactivated, and then the thrLABC is produced instead.

{wiki}

COVID happens in two stages:
* viral infection
* \x[inflammatory] phase, where the body takes over, and sometimes harms itself. It seems that people are not generally contagious at this point?

This distinction is one of the reasons why separating the virus name (SARS-CoV-2) from the disease makes sense: the disease is much broader than the viral infection.

= Why it takes several days to enter inflammatory phase in COVID-19?
{parent=covid-19}
{wiki}

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7247969/

Why is it there such a clear separation of phases?

Why do people with mild symptoms go on to die? It is a great mystery.

\x[ciro-santilli]'s theory is that COVID is extremely effective at avoiding \x[immune-response]. Then, in people where this is effective, things reach a point where there is so much virus, that the body notices and moves on to take a more drastic approach. This is compatible with the virus killing older people more, as they have weaker immunes systems. This is however incompatible with the fact that people don't seem to be contagious after the viral phase is over...

\Q[This site is the origin of replication of the E. coli chromosome. It contains the binding sites for DnaA, which is critical for initiation of replication. Replication proceeds bidirectionally. For historical reasons, the numbering of E. coli's \x[circular-chromosome] does not start at the \x[origin-of-replication], but at the origin of transfer during conjugation.]
If it is a bit hard to understand what they mean by "origin of transfer" though, as that term is usually associated with the \x[origin-of-transfer] of \x[bacterial-conjugation].

Part of \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-operon-thrlabc].

At only 65 bp, this gene is quite small and boring. For a more interesting gene, have a look at the next gene, \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-gene-thra].

Does something to do with \x[threonine].

This is the first in the sequence thrL, thrA, thrB, thrC. This type of naming convention is quite common on related adjacent proteins, all of which must be getting \x[transcribed-biology] into a single \x[rna] by the same \x[promoter-genetics]. As mentioned in the analysis of the \x[kegg] entry for \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-gene-thra], those A, B and C are actually directly functionally linked in a direct \x[metabolic-pathway].

We can see that thrL, A, B, and C are in the same \x[transcription-unit] by browsing the list of \x[promoter-genetics]{p} at: https://biocyc.org/group?id=:ALL-PROMOTERS&orgid=ECOLI[]. By finding the first one by position we reach; https://biocyc.org/ECOLI/NEW-IMAGE?object=TU0-42486[].

The second \x[gene] in the \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655] genome. Part of the \x[e-coli-k-12-mg1655-operon-thrlabc].

Part of a reaction that produces \x[threonine].

This \x[protein] is an \x[enzyme]{parent}. The \x[uniprot] entry clearly shows the \x[chemical-reaction]{p} that it \x[catalyses]. In this case, there are actually two! It can either transforming the \x[metabolite]:
* "L-homoserine" into "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde"
* "L-aspartate" into "4-phospho-L-aspartate"
Also interestingly, we see that both of those reaction require some extra energy to catalyse, one needing \x[adenosine-triphosphate] and the other \x[nadp-plus].

TODO: any mention of how much faster it makes the reaction, numerically?

Since this is an \x[enzyme], it would also be interesting to have a quick search for it in the \x[kegg] entry starting from the organism: https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco01100+M00022 We type in the search bar "thrA", it gives a long list, but the last entry is our "thrA". Selecting it highlights two pathways in the large \x[graph], so we understand that it catalyzes two different reactions, as suggested by the protein name itself (fused blah blah). We can now hover over:
* the \x[edge-graph]: it shows all the enzymes that catalyze the given reaction. Both edges actually have multiple enzymes, e.g. the L-Homoserine path is also catalyzed by another enzyme called metL.
* the \x[node-graph]: they are the \x[metabolite]{p}, e.g. one of the paths contains "L-homoserine" on one node and "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde"
Note that common \x[cofactor-biochemistry]{p} are omitted, since we've learnt from the UniProt entry that this reaction uses ATP.

If we can now click on the L-Homoserine edge, it takes us to: https://www.genome.jp/entry/eco:b0002+eco:b3940[]. Under "Pathway" we see an interesting looking pathway "Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism": https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260+b0002 which contains a small manually selected and extremely clearly named subset of the larger graph!

But looking at the bottom of this subgraph (the UI is not great, can't Ctrl+F and enzyme names not shown, but the selected enzyme is slightly highlighted in red because it is in the URL https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260+b0002[] vs https://www.genome.jp/pathway/eco00260[]) we clearly see that thrA, thrB and thrC for a sequence that directly transforms "L-aspartate 4-semialdehyde" into "Homoserine" to "O-Phospho-L-homoserine" and finally to\x[threonine]. This makes it crystal clear that they are not just located adjacently in the genome by chance: they are actually functionally related, and likely controlled by the same transcription factor: when you want one of them, you basically always want the three, because you must be are lacking \x[threonine]. TODO find transcription factor!

The UniProt entry also shows an interactive browser of the \x[tertiary-structure] of the protein. We note that there are currently two sources available: \x[x-ray-crystallography] and \x[alphafold]. To be honest, the \x[alphafold] one looks quite off!!!

By inspecting the \x[fasta] for the entire genome, or by using the \x[ncbi-open-reading-frame-tool], we see that this gene lies entirely in its own \x[open-reading-frame], so it is quite boring

From the \x[fasta] we see that the very first three \x[codon]{p} at position 337 are
```
ATG CGA GTG
```
where `ATG` is the \x[start-codon], and CGA GTG should be the first two that actually go into the protein:
* CGA: \x[arginine]
* GTG: \x[valine]

https://ecocyc.org/gene?orgid=ECOLI&id=ASPKINIHOMOSERDEHYDROGI-MONOMER[] mentions that the enzime is most active as \x[protein-complex] with four copies of the same protein:
\Q[Aspartate kinase I / homoserine dehydrogenase I comprises a \x[protein-dimer][dimer] of ThrA dimers. Although the dimeric form is catalytically active, the binding equilibrium dramatically favors the tetrameric form. The aspartate kinase and homoserine dehydrogenase activities of each ThrA monomer are catalyzed by independent domains connected by a linker region.]

The weirdest \x[mammal] \x[clade]: they lay fucking \x[egg]{p}. Only 5 known species alive as of 2020.

Eggs are \x[basal-phylogenetics]: they simply didn't evolve out of what other \x[reptile]{p} do. From which we conclude that \x[milk] came before \x[egg]{p} stopped.

So this is the most basal subclade of mammals.

{parent=plant}
{wiki=Cranberry_bean}

This looks a lot like the beans that \x[brazilian]{p} venerate and can be easily found in the \x[united-kingdom] as of 2020.

The more exact type seems to be \x[pinto-bean], but this is close enough.

2021-03: same but 2.5 teaspons, seems to be the right ammount.

2021-02-10: attempt 3: 500g 1 hour 30 minutes no pressure, uncontrolled water. Salt with one chorizo: put 3 teaspoons, it was a bit too much, going to do 2 next time and see.

2020-12-14: attempt 3: 250g of beans, 1.5l of water, 30 minutes pressure.

2020-11-30: attempt 2: 275ml of dry beans, about 50% of 500g bag, putting 1650 ml (6x) of water on pressure cooker Still had to throw out some water.

Density dry raw: 216 g/250 ml = 432 g / 500 ml = 500 g / 580 ml = 864 g/L

500 g dry expands to in water after 12 hours: 1200 ml

Therefore 500 g dry = 864 / 2 L = 432 ml expands about 3x.

Therefore, to the maximum 2.5L of the cooker with 8x https://www.oliviascuisine.com/brazilian-style-beans/[dry volume water from this recipe] I can use:
``
2500 = volume expanded bean + volume water = 3 volume dry bean + 8 volume dry bean = 11 volume dry bean
``
and so:
``
volume dry bean = 2500/11 = 227ml
``
which is about 227 / 580 = 40% of the 500 g bag.

After first try, I found that 8x volume of water is way, way too much. Going to try 6x next time.

= Pinto bean
{parent=plant}

This seems to be the "brown \x[brazilian] bean" that many Brazilians eat every day.

Edit: after buying it, not 100% sure. This one felt smaller than what Ciro had in Brazil, \x[borlotti-beans] might be closer. Pinto beans are smaller, and creamier, and have softer peel, possibly produced less \x[fart][natural gas].

2021-04: second try.

2021-03: did for first time, started with same procedure as \x[borlotti-beans] 2021-03. Maybe 1h30 is too much. Outcome was still very good.

Sequence alignment is trying to match a \x[dna] or \x[amino-acid] sequence, even though the sequences might not be exactly the same, otherwise it would be a straight up \x[string-search-algorithm].

This is fundamental in \x[bioinformatics] for two reasons:
* when you \x[sequence-the-dna] of a new \x[species], you can guess what each \x[protein] does by comparing it with similar proteins in other species that you have already studied
* when doing \x[dna-sequencing], and specially \x[short-read-dna-sequencing], you generally need to align the reads to reference genomes to know where you are inside the entire genome, and then be able to spot \x[mutation]{p}, notably \x[single-nucleotide-polymorphism]{p}

\x[ciro-santilli] supports full legalization of all drugs, because he feels that it would be better overall for the world to have cheaper drugs and more \x[drug-addict]{p}, but way, way less \x[organized-crime].

These should be extremely controlled of course, with extremely high \x[tax]{p} that puts their price just below the current illegal market, and a complete ban on any positive \x[advertising].

Ciro believes that maybe the \x[government] could even go as far as giving free drugs to \x[drug-addict]{p} so they don't have to \x[theft][rob] to get a fix.

This is notably considering that drug-led organized crime completely dominates and corrupts the \x[politics] of many production and trafficking zones, which are already generally poor \x[fucked] up places to start with:
* \x[mexican-drug-war]
* \x[golden-crescent]
* \x[golden-triangle-southeast-asia]
Ciro's experiences in Brazil such as mentioned at \x[sao-remo-the-favela-next-to-usp], although much less extreme than the above, also come to mind.

Drug traffic corrupts everything. It prevents development of honest people. It is a \x[cancer], which we have failed time and time a gain to cure. The only cure is to accept the other less insidious of addiction.
