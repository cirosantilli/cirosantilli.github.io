= Ciro's ASCII art circuit diagram notation
{c}
{parent=ASCII art circuit diagram}

This notation is designed to be relatively easy to write. This is achieved by not drawing ultra complex ASCII art boxes of every component. It would be slightly more readable if we did that, but prioritizing the writer here.

Two wires are only joined if `+` is given. E.g. the following two wires are not joined:
``
  |
--|--
  |
``
but the following are:
``
  |
--+--
  |
``

Simple symmetric components:
* `-`, `+` and `|`: wire
* `A`: <AC source>. Parameters:
  * `Hz`: frequency
  * `V`: peak voltage
* `C`: <capacitor>
* `D`: <DC source>. If only one side is given, the other is assumed to be at a ground
* `G`: ground. Often used together with `D`, e.g.:
  ``
  D_10---R_10---G
  ``
  means applying a voltage of 10 V across a 10 Ohm <resistor>, which would lead to a current of 1 A
* `L`: <inductor>
* `R`: <resistor>
* `V`: <Voltmeter> without explicit positive and negative sides
* `X`: <Josephson junction>

Asymmetric components have multiple letters indicating different ports. The capital letter indicates the device, and lower case letters the ports. The wires then go into the ports:
* `aDc`: <diode>
  * `a`: anode (where electrons can come in from)
  * `c`: cathode
  Sample usage in a circuit:
  ``
  --aDc--
  ``
  Can also be used vertically:
  ``
  |
  a
  D
  c
  |
  ``
  We can also change the port order, the device is still the same due to capital `D`:
  ``
  --cDa--

   |
  Dac--

   |
  Dca--

     |
  --caD
  ``
* `sgTd`: <transistor>
  * `s`: source
  * `g`: gate
  * `d`: gate
  Sample usage in a circuit:
  ``
  ---+
     |
  --sgTd--
  ``
  All the following are also equivalent:
  ``
     |
     g
  --sTd--
  ``
  ``
      |
  --Tsgd--
     |
  ``
* `pVn`: <Voltmeter> with explicit positive and negative sides
* `dIs`: <electric current> source. Electrons leave from `s` and go into `d`

Numbers characterizing components are put just next to each component with an underscore. When there is only one parameter, standard units are assumed, e.g.:
``
+-----+
|     |
C_1p  R_2k
|     |
+-----+
``
means:
* a capacitor with 1 pico Faraday
* a resistor with 2 k Ohms
Micro is denoted as `u`.

Wires can just freely come in and out of specs of a component, they are then just connected to the component, e.g.:
``
D_10---R_10---G
``
means applying a voltage of 10 V across a 10 Ohm <resistor>, which would lead to a current of 1 A

If a component has more than two parameters, units are used to distinguish them when possible, e.g.:
``
A_1kV_2MHz
``
means an <AC source> with:
* 1 kV <voltage>
* 1 MHz frequency

When <Ciro Santilli> was studying electronics at the <University of SÃ£o Paulo>, the courses, which were heavily inspired from the <USA> 50's were obsessed by this one! Thinking about it, it is kind of a cool thing though.

That https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LC_circuit&oldid=1085148789[Wikipedia page] is the epitome of <it is not possible to teach natural sciences on Wikipedia>[Wikipedia failure to explain things in a way that is of any interest to any learner]. <video Tutorial on LC resonant circuits by w2aew (2012)}> is the opposite.

{description=
* https://youtu.be/hqhV50852jA?t=239 <series LC circuit> on a <breadboard> driven by an <AC source>. Shows behaviour on <oscilloscope> as source frequency is modified. We clearly see voltage going to zero at resonance. This is why thie circuit can be seen as a <filter (signal processing)>.
* https://youtu.be/hqhV50852jA?t=489 shows the <parallel LC circuit>. We clearly see current reaching a maximum on resonance.

{title=LC circuit dampened oscillations on an oscilloscope by Queuerious Guy (2014)}
{description=Finally a video that shows the oscillations without a driving <AC source>. The dude just move wires around on his <breadboard> manually, first charging the <capacitor> and then closing the LC circuit, and is able to see damped oscillations on the <oscilloscope>.}

{title=<LC circuit> by <Eugene Khutoryansky> (2016)}
{description=Exactly what you would expect from an <Eugene Khutoryansky> video. The key insight is that the <inductor> resists to changes in current. So when current is zero, it slows down the current. And when current is high, it tries to keep it going, which recharges the other side of the <capacitor>.}
