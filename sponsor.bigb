= Sponsor Ciro Santilli's work on OurBigBook.com
{scope}

<Ciro Santilli> is actively looking for donations and contracts so he can continue to work full time on <OurBigBook.com> sustainably, and develop free hardcore university-level <STEM> education for all ages!

At 100k <USD>, I will quit my job to work full time on it for one year. During this year I will use my contacts with STEM students of a world leading unviersity near where I live and solve as many of their problem sheets as possible, mostly by refering to OurBigBook.com articles I'll be writing. The goal is to get as much STEM konwledge as possible into the world, and highlight how flawed presential and sequential Higher Education is, while positioning <OurBigBook.com> as an alternative way to organize humanity's knowledge. Quite grand.

Status: \b[~144k / 200k USD] reached. 1st year locked in and starting summer 2024, 2nd year stretch goal open. A second year greatly improve chances of success: year one I solve a bunch of courses, year two I come guns blazing with the content and expand further. Donation breakdown:
* 2024-03-18: \$126,352 (!!!): anonymous 1000 <Monero> donation to self-custody wallet. Further comments: <1000 Monero donation>.
* 2024-03-13: \$1,375: anonymous 10 <Monero> donation to self-custody wallet
* 2023-11-20: \$14,860: anonymous 100 <Monero> donation to <Binance> wallet
* 2023-09: \$810: anonymous 0.032 <Bitcoin> donation to <Coinbase> wallet
* subscriptions up to 2024-01: \$143,795
More details: <Accounting method>{full}

https://cirosantilli.com/sponsor 100k USD = I quit my job 1 year to work on ourbigbook.com + higher ed. Status: ~144k/200k USD reached. 1st year starting Summer 2024 after 1000 @Monero #XMR donation! At 200k USD I add a second year. This would increase chances of success a lot.

\b[How to give]:
* one time donations:
  * \b[<cryptocurrency>]: note that Ciro is not a regular crypto user, so you might want to make a smaller test donation and confirm that it worked by <contact>[contacting] Ciro before going for colossal amounts (one can dream):
    * \b[<Bitcoin>] address: \b[3KRk7f2JgekF6x7QBqPHdZ3pPDuMdY3eWR]. This is a <Coinbase> wallet, <off-chain transactions> with no transaction fees accepted from other <Coinbase> users. This method has been tested, I have been able to receive funds from this address in 2023. Fees: non-fixed trading feeshttps://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/fees{ref} + 0% withdrawal fee on top of any Bitcoin network for on-chain transactionshttps://help.coinbase.com/en/exchange/funding/withdrawing-with-a-uk-bank-account{ref}
    * \b[<Monero>] address: \b[47kzoCeRMTohJhADejtsGmGimvQKzNsuST7u2aVhAD1VX5WDbh3v1FPUoJoTK3NTJVUgAM3dWCqC4Tmp9KSQaJi6GGYWgYn]. This is a self-custody wallet and I check it weekly on weekends. I cash out via #AgoraDesk. Previously I used <Binance>, but they delisted 2024-02-20, which confirms that <Monero> privacy hadn't yet been broken and that Monero is still one of the most useful cryptocurrencies: <Are cryptocurrencies useful?>{full}. This address has been tested: https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1769464788009066710
    Ciro's policy is to cash out all <cryptocurrency> donations as soon as possible, he is a boring old <S&P 500> kind of guy. He would have been the nerd that mined on the early days for fun had he heard of it... but he was <university is broken[>[just stuck in useless university grade mode].
  * <TransferWise> tag: https://wise.com/pay/me/cirod3[]. It shows as "<Ciro Duran Santilli>" and that's correct. No fees apparently? Love it!
  * \b[<PayPal>]: https://paypal.me/cirosantilli[]. Note that <dots in Gmail address> are ignored, and it is perfectly normal if the <email> you see has some extra dots in it. Fees: 2.9% + 0.30 GBPhttps://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#fixed-fees-donation{ref}.
* monthly subscriptions of 1<Dollar>[[$]]/month or more on either:
  * \b[<GitHub Sponsors>]: https://github.com/sponsors/cirosantilli[]. Fees: 0% for individuals, up to 6% for organizationshttps://docs.github.com/en/sponsors/getting-started-with-github-sponsors/about-github-sponsors{ref}
  * \b[<Patreon>]: https://www.patreon.com/cirosantilli[]. Fees: 8% pro plan + 1% <PayPal> withdrawal capped at 20 USDhttps://support.patreon.com/hc/en-gb/articles/11111747095181-Creator-fees{ref}. We are waiting to reach the cap to withdraw!
  Symbolic 1 dollar/month donation are extremely welcome to signal your interest! This way if a certain critical mass of sponsors is ever reached (~100?), Ciro can start to more actively asking slightly higher amounts to really try to achieve full time self sufficiency.
* larger grants/contracts from filthy rich individuals or organizations: contact Ciro as mentioned at: <contact>{full} to discuss.

  Ciro is interested in contracts/voluntary work that would be compatible/synergic with the <OurBigBook.com> project. Some possibilities include:
  * interacting directly with classes of university students to help them learn the class subject, while at the same time  spreading the university knowledge outside of the university walls
  * one-to-one mentoring of individuals of any age that are looking to make an impact in the world, and not just pass their <exams>
  * fixing specific bugs in related projects Ciro has experience in. These could be either via one-off contracts, or on platforms such as:
    * https://www.bountysource.com/people/25676-ciro-santilli
And if you have a different preferred payment mechanism not listed above, please <contact>[contact Ciro], and he will set it up.

  Ciro's current ambitions require him to remain in developed countries, because Ciro wants to <what poor countries have to do to get richer>[document advanced science and technology] by liaising with top universities, and there is not nearly as much high technology in poor countries. Remaining in developed countries is also a required due to family reasons.

\b[If you would like public acknowledgement for your support, Ciro will very gladly give it, just let Ciro know how you'd prefer it]. Due to <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>, many supporters have chosen to be anonyomous, and that is totally fine, not everyone is interested in politics, or has a situation where going public is acceptable, so we don't have a standard setup yet, let's build it together. A acknowledgement section at the bottom of this page would be a minimum, but I for larger donations we could add a your advertisement in a locations such as:
* near the top of of the <accounts controlled by Ciro Santilli>, e.g. one of <Ciro Santilli's Twitter accounts>, https://github.com/cirosantilli or https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245
* near the top of https://cirosantilli.com

= Why you should give money to Ciro Santilli
{parent=sponsor}

So that he can work full time on <OurBigBook.com> and revolutionize advanced university-level <science, technology, engineering, and mathematics> eduction for all ages.

Donating to Ciro is the most effective donation per dollar that you can make to:
* improve hardcore university-level <STEM> education for all ages
* help make every child into the next <Nobel Prize>/<Fields Medal>/<deep tech> unicorn co-founder

Ciro's goal in life is to help kids as young as possible to reach, and the push, the frontiers of <natural sciences> human knowledge, linking it to applications that might be the <the next big thing> as early as possible. Because nothing is more motivating to students than that feeling of:
\Q[Hey, I can actually do something in this area that has never been done before!]
rather than repeating the same crap that <enter through the narrow gate>[everyone is already learning].

To do this, Ciro wants to work in parallel both on:
* the multi-user website e-learning platform of <OurBigBook.com>
* creating amazing teaching content that motivates that platform, and that deeply interests Ciro, notably <quantum mechanics> and its related applications:
  * <quantum computing>
  * <molecular biology>
  * <condensed matter physics> and <chemistry>
  * slightly more theoretical stuff in somewhat related fields of:
    * <mathematics>
    * <quantum electrodynamics>
  * continue to dump his brain/research in areas Ciro has expertise in: <software engineering> and <open source software>

Ciro believes that this rare combination of both:
* <articles>[proven passion and capability] to learn and teach <science, technology, engineering, and mathematics> subjects
* <Ciro Santilli's Stack Overflow contributions>[proven programming skills], including web development
produces a virtuous circle, because Ciro:
* wants to learn and teach, so he starts to create content
* then he notices the teaching tools are crap
* and since he has the ability to actually improve them, he does

As explained at <OurBigBook.com> and <high flying bird vs gophers>[high flying bird scientist], Ciro is most excited to make contributions at the <Middle Way>["missing middle level of specialization"] that lies around later undergrad and lower grad education:
* at lower undergrad level, there is already a lot of free material out there to learn stuff
* at upper graduate level and beyond, too few people know about each specific subject, that it becomes hard to factor things out
But on that middle sweet spot, Ciro believes that something can be done, in such as way that delivers:
* beauty
* power
in a way that is:
* in your face, without requiring you to study for a year
* but also giving enough precision to allow you to truly appreciate the beauty of the subject

  Ciro's programming skills can also be used to create educational, or actually more production-like, simulations and illustrations.

Ciro believes that today's society just keep saying over and over: "<STEM> is good", "STEM is good", "STEM is good" as a <religious> mantra, but fails miserably at providing free learning material and interaction opportunities for people to actually learn it at a deep enough level to truly appreciate why "STEM is good". This is what he wants to fix.

The following quote is ripped from <Gwern Branwen>'s https://www.patreon.com/gwern[Patreon page], and it perfectly synthesizes how Ciro feels as well:
\Q[Omar Khayyam also came to the Vizier... but not to ask for title or office. 'The greatest boon you can confer on me,' he said, 'is to let me live in a corner under the shadow of your fortune, to spread wide the advantages of Science, and pray for your long life and prosperity.']
{title=Omar Khayyam's chill out quote}

In addition to all of this, financial support also helps Ciro continue his general community support activities:
* writing and updating his amazing <Stack Overflow> answers: <Ciro Santilli's Stack Overflow contributions>{full}
* saving the world from the CCP: <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>{full}

= Accounting method
{parent=sponsor}

= Budget transparency
{synonym}

A detailed list of all transactions is kept atat: \a[sponsor/budget.js].

Ciro Santilli use the following accounting for this sponsorship calculations.

For significant one time donations, he takes the final money received in one of his cash GBP accounts, then he checks how much that is in dollars on Google at the time of cashout, and then writes that ammount down as the final dollar value which is what ultimately counts. This exposes Ciro to USD/GBP fluctuations, but it simplifies accounting for donors which is more important, so it is likely worth it.

For small regular donations, Ciro just tallies it all up in GBP from time to time and converts it all to dollars in one go as it is not worth spending too much time updating those too often.

= Progress updates
{parent=sponsor}

<Ciro Santilli> wants to make sure that you get clear highlights of what your donation money is going into.

Besides the <budget transparency>, he is trying to give clear and summarized details of development milestones.

The following channels are being used:
* https://twitter.com/cirosantilli2[]: Ciro's secondary Twitter has a small stream of smaller updates, usually one or two a week, both project specific, but also of "the project led me to answer this <Stack Overflow> question" nature, as well as short <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[China updates].

  Major milestones will also appear under the primary twitter: https://twitter.com/cirosantilli[].
* Ciro's Edit: Ciro has been sending update emails entitled "Ciro's Edict" to his sponsors. These include information more or less similar to the Twitter, but in a more cohesive form not limited to 140 character paragraphs.

  When emails would get too large, Ciro is creating separate pages for them, see e.g.: <updates/4>. This does reduce the exclusive priviledge of the sponsors a little bit, but better have clearer communication in the first place.
* https://github.com/ourbigbook/ourbigbook/commits[]: the more hardcore coders amongst you can also of course have a quick look at the commit log. Ciro has been trying to keep it relatively clean and meaningful, to varying degrees of success.

= 1000 Monero donation
{parent=sponsor}
{scope}

On 2024-03-18, <Ciro Santilli> received an anonymous 1000 <Monero> donation (worth ~126k USD at the time) to his self-custody wallet, which pushed him over his public plea for 100k USD goal to quit his job for one year.

Since this donation is so huge, it deserves some comments and a bit of a retrospective. The path to this donation has been an interactive one, and it is described below.

After starting the <OurBigBook Project>, Ciro started the <sponsor> page on <cirosantilli.com> and setup some donation methods to help support the project, and possibly try to capitalize a bit on <Ciro Santilli's Stack Overflow contributions>.

His sponsors are absolutely crazy amazing people, but Ciro simply could attract a large enough amount of small sponsors to reach life changing amounts under those circumstances. This is partly due to <video And I am not and never have been 'familiar' scene from The Big Short (2015)>.

As such, Ciro came to realize more and more that the best approach would be to reach out to a smaller number of rich people, given that the things he works on niche, but may appeal to a particularly wealthy tranche of the population: <STEM> people. Other experiences and ideas that contribute to this realization are:
* the creation of the https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#ourbigbook-com-fellowship[OurBigBook Fellowship], which as of writing consisted of a single donation. During this exercise, <Ciro Santilli> gave about 2k USD to help a promising Brazilian student. In doing so, he understood a lot about what goes on inside a "rich person's" head when considering a donation
  * it is hard to decide who to donate to and find those people. In part because as soon as you create a public donation system with an application process, people will game the fuck out of it. Perhaps the <Lost Horse LLC> approach of "they find you" is the best?
  * it is basically impossible to donate more than 1% of your net worth if you have a family. Even 1% you may be discouraged about. Perhaps with reason due to previous bad donations they have made.
* the increasing <wealth inequality> of this world, perhaps one of the greatest problems we now face

Then, whenever a larger donation would come through and surprise Ciro, he would improve his sponsor page statements. First a private 150 USD by an awesome sponsor. Then the 2023-09 ~810\$ <Bitcoin> one. Finally came the 2023-11-20 100 Monero one. And it was that one that pushed Ciro to start his "100k USD = 1 year campaign".

Finally on 2024-03-13, Ciro received an anonymous 10 <Monero> donation to self-custody wallet. He had clearly stated that one should make a test donation to that wallet before the big one, so 10 Monero felt like it could be the test one. Ciro communicated the reception at: https://mastodon.social/@cirosantilli/112112988286298258 / https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1769464788009066710 Over the next few days, Ciro checked his wallet more often than his previously self imposed once a weekend max, and as expected, he found the big one on a slightly despaired around midnight sleepless night (partly due to parenthood). He was feeling particularly bored and a bit sad with his work life that night. And there it was. 1000 Monero on the wallet. Needless to say, not much sleep was done on that evening!!!

{title=Screenshot of <Ciro Santilli>'s Monero wallet with 1000 Monero in it just after the donation}
{height=800}

The following days were also tense, with Ciro having a trial by fire on selling large amounts of <Monero> on the UK, which is not trivial as it had been banned from all major exchanges. But he managed. Further notes on that at: https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/17arz9f/converting_xmr_to_gbp_in_the_uk/[]. Ciro also decided to keep about 200 Monero around just for fun as a crazy moonshot.

Another major factor likely Ciro having published his article: <Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain>{full} in 2019. This is something he wrote entirely for fun during an intense 3 week side-time binge in 2019, though some large updates were made later on. It was this article that likely some crypto-dude attention to <Ciro Santilli>'s profile. As of 2024, there is said to be about 20 crypto billionaires, so perhaps there are about 2000 crypto 10 millionaireshttps://www.fastcompany.com/90949038/bitcoin-price-billionaires-list-crypto-wealth-2023{ref}, which is the minimum net worth for a donation of 100k USD to be feasible (1% mark). And perhaps a reasonable number of them are just nerds who got rich, and want to improve the world. There are two lessons from this:
* follow your instincts, always. If something seems mega fun and quick, do it!
* making money from a few rich people (or entities like organizations) is easier than working for a bunch of poor people, because you have to convince less people. If you reach many poor people however, things are much more stable as you can lose a few customers and still be fine

Another factor in the donation, <Ciro Santilli> believes, is that many rich people thing that education is bullshit. As mentioned on the awesome series <The Playlist> via a hypothetical <Peter Thiel>, a large number of rich people are <#neurodiverse>, and it is obvious why: you have to be different to make it big, but you are worse off on average for it. <How can I be as great by Justine Musk>{full} comes to mind. As such, it is only natural that a large number of rich people want to improve our educational system, which tends to be the very epitome of "boring and average normalness" which <Ciro Santilli> so much detests. This can also be seen in people such as:
* <Michael J. Saylor> and his <Saylor Academy>
* <Peter Thiel> and his <Thiel Fellowship>

Announcements:

= Anonymity of the donation
{parent=1000 Monero donation}

The anonymity of the donation is mind blowing.

The first sensation Ciro Santilli got was as if God himself had come down from heaven to toy with an unsuspecting human being. God running an experiment. Or perhaps an <AGI> that had already secretly taken over. Not very different.

Like with God, this was the answer to Ciro's prayers on <Twitter>. A one way conversation that leaves you uncertain of the details.

Besides the awesomeness however, anonymity is a risk.

Ciro ran this over and over in his head, and the only big risk of anonymity is that if this money is ever proven to be from the proceeds of crime, he would have to give it back to the government and "lose one year's salary he would have otherwise gained".

However, that worst case scenario is not bad enough. If anything, it was a great excuse to quit his job for his family and wife is already worth it. Ciro could do it and survive, though situation would deteriorate slowly. <don't be a pussy>[But he was a coward previously].

Ciro does however feel that there is good chance that it is legitimate.

<Ciro Santilli's Stack Overflow contributions> are exceptional, he's amazing right! He deserves this! Of course, there is danger in this rationale which scammers could exploit. But bro, if scammers are going to send 100k USD to me, then please continue to do so!

Also which criminal would be stupid enough to donate proceeds of crime to a highly public person who is going to clearly announce it?

Just be warned, if you come with a baseball bat trying to get the money back by force, I will call the police immediately and by God you will not get it!!

Given this, Ciro just keeps thinking about the likely profile of the donor:
* 10m+ net worth
* either got rich with <Monero>, or thought <Monero> was interesting and wanted to test it out while doing something cool. Also perhaps he has a personal stake in Monero and is trying to advertise it?

But the "why anonymous if not criminal" question remains. Generally rich people want recognition both for:
* reputation washing
* to make their donation mechanisms higher profile which allows raising more and attracting better candidates and reach greater impact
Two options that come to mind:
* rich crypto dude that doesn't want thieves to know he is rich
* more public rich person that doesn't want association with <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China> which could hurt business
* crazy rich person with a philosophy of "if they knew who I was it might interfere with what they do". AKA a <God>.
