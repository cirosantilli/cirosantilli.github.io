One of the least <evil> of the big tech companies of the early 21st century, partly because <Sergey Brin>'s parents fled from the Soviet Union and so he is <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[anti censorship], although they https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine)[have been tempted by it].

Google only succeeds at highly algorithmic tasks or at giving infinite storage to users to then mine their data.

It is incapable however of adding any obvious useful end user features to most of its products, most of which get terminated and cannot be relied on:

Too many genius engineers. They need some dumber people like <Ciro Santilli> who <Ciro Santilli's bad old event memory>[need to write documentation to learn stuff].

<Ciro Santilli> actually attempted two interviews to work at Google in the early 2010's but very quickly failed both on the first phase, because you have to be a fast well trained coding machine to pass that interview.

Ciro later felt better about himself by fantasizing how he would actually do more important things outside of Google and that they would beg to buy him instead.

He was also happy that he wouldn't have to use Google crazy internal tools: someone once said that Google's tools make easy tasks middle hard, and they also make impossible tasks middle hard. TODO source.

But whatever the case: Ciro <grinding for software interviews>[will not, ever, spend his time drilling programmer competition problems to join a company].

The 1997 <Wayback Machine> archives are just priceless: https://web.archive.org/web/19971210065425/http://backrub.stanford.edu/backrub.html[]. I'm so glad that website exists and started so early. It is just another university research project demo website like any other. Priceless.

<Craig Silverstein> was the first employee hired, in 1998: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge

In August 1998 they had an their first investment of \$100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, <Sun Microsystems> co-founder. Some sources say September 1998. This was an event of legend, the dude dropped by, tested the website for a few minutes, said I like it, and dropped a 100\$ check with no paperwork. Google wasn't even incorporated, they had to incorporate to cash the check. They were apparently introduced by one of the teachers, TODO which. Some sources say he had to rush off to another meeting afterwards:

Tried to sell it for 1 million in early 1999... OMG the way the world is. It would be good to learn more about that story, and when they noticed it was fuckup.

One of Google's most interesting stories is how their startup garage owner https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Wojcicki[became an important figure inside Google], and how Sergei https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Wojcicki[married her sister]. These were the best garage tenants ever!

{wiki}

The guy who coded the initial version of <BackRub>, the first version of <Google Search>, but left before the company formed. TODO how did he meet <Largey Brage>? Why did he leave <Google>?

In 1997 he cofounded <eGroups>, a <mailing list> management website, together with the mysterious <Carl Victor Page, Jr.>, <Larry Page>'s older brother. <eGroups> was sold to <Yahoo!> in 2000 for \$432m, just before the <Dot-com bubble> burst.

As of 2021 his net worth was of "only" \$1b, even though his original Google shares would have been worth \$13b. He must have sold too much too early to do other cool stuff. https://archive.ph/IgkMI[]:
> When Mr. Page and Mr. Brin founded Google in 1998, Mr. Hassan bought 160,000 shares for \$800. When <Google> went public in 2004, the shares were worth more than \$200 million. The shares, now in Google’s parent company, Alphabet, would be valued at more than \$13 billion today \[2021\].
Did <Largey> give him this nice deal as a way to thank him for helping start the company, or was it just that they had no big hopes and \$800 seemed right? https://youtu.be/pmXDtTD6vQY?t=146 suggests the stocks were part of his compensation for 3 months of coding work.

{source=https://www.xprize.org/about/people/scott-hassan}

In 2001, Scott married a #Vietnamese chick called <Allison Huynh> from university and they had three children.

In 2014 Hassan asked for a divorce, and the proceedings were a shitshow, lasting more than 7 years.

In 2004 he tried strike a \$20 millionhttps://youtu.be/PrWZUI_Qq1w?t=94{ref} #post-nuptial after <Google> went public, which she declined, so things were already crappy back then.

Then, during the divorce, Scott even created a revenge website for her as well. He's so petty! Down as of 2024 of course. There are only some weird redirect archives now: https://web.archive.org/web/20210915000000*/https://allisonhuynh.com redirecting to https://sites.google.com/view/allisonhuynhcom

The divorce is covered in several major outlets:
* https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9912929/Billionaire-investor-helped-launch-Google-accused-divorce-terrorism-bitter-break-up.html
* https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/Scott-Hassan-Allison-Huynh-divorce.html
* https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/who-is-scott-hassan-the-google-founder-accused-of-divorce-terrorism-10543641.htm
* https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2020/02/28/suitable-technologies-bankruptcy-filing-scott-hassan-allison-huynh/

To be fair, he did work on a lot of cool stuff after <BackRub> for which he deserves credit, not the least the company that created the <Robot Operating System>, which is a cool sounding <open source> project, which is awesome. But this divorce story is so damning! He should just own up to it, split the cash, and move on... The fact that the <Google> money came from an investment before marriage likely complicates things.

The fact that he does not have a <Wikipedia> page as of 2022 is mind blowing, especially after divorce details. Maybe <Ciro Santilli> will create it one day. Just no patience now. OK, done it June 2022: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Hassan let's see if it lasts. The page lasted but ended up being <Ciro Santilli>'s first <edit war>, how exciting:
* December 2022: an anonymous user with IP from <California> removed divorce details and google share ownership details, both of which had a <New York Times> source: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/Scott-Hassan-Allison-Huynh-divorce.html[]. Discussion at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Scott_Hassan#Divorce_details_removed_as_%22poorly_sourced_material%22_by_anonymous_user_even_though_they_had_a_source_from_the_New_York_Times It feels exactly like the type of thing Scott would have done himself. And he possibly inadvertently exposed his real <IP> in doing so: 24.6.226.102. It is pingable, but <Nmap> analysis shows nothing of interest.
* June 2024: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scott_Hassan&diff=prev&oldid=1229976978[another partial revert] removing the juicy divorce details by user named "ReversingWrongs". The username choice so incredibly cute and naive it makes Ciro wonder if this is from some woman that loves him (mother, child, new partner?) rather than just a Hassan <#sockpuppet>. OK, perhaps with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#People_who_are_relatively_unknown the divorce has to be left out? It's always impossible to decide with those wikipedia things. What you can say, is not necessarily what people want to read about, even when it is incredibly well source.

Looking a the history, he just kept revealing different IPs and continuously reverting, which other people put back in. Another of his IPs:
* 24.234.111.66 is marked as being from <#Las Vegas> online.
There is also https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scott_Hassan&diff=1224480994&oldid=1218515347[an interesting edit from 2600:1700:5470:5c50:7566:9580:1b60:ab41] which mentions without source the little known fact
> after working at Washington University's Medical Libraries Group (having been recruited out of SUNY Buffalo for the summer).
so it could be Hassan adding some actually good and interesting information to the article. That one however also has an edit to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Nagel so maybe it's not him.

https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780385342728 on the <Internet Archive Open Library>.

Has some good mentions, but often leaves you wanting more details of how certain things happened, especially the early days stuff.

Does however paint a good picture of several notable employees, and non-search projects from the early 2000's including:
* the cook dude
* porn cookie guy
* the unusual IPO process

Paints a very positive picture of the founders. It is likely true. They gave shares generously to early employees. Tried to allow the more general public to buy from IPO, by using a bidding scheme, rather than focusing on the big bankers as was usual.

The introduction mentions that <Google> is very interested in <molecular biology> and mining <genetics> data, much like <Ciro Santilli>! Can't find external references however...
> Two of the most compelling areas that Google and its founders are quietly working on are the promising fields of <molecular biology> and <genetics>. Millions of genes in combination with massive amounts of biological and scientific data are an excellent match for the Google search engine, the tremendous database the company has in place, and its immense computing power. Already, Google has downloaded a map of the human genome and is working closely with biologist Dr. <Craig Venter> and other leaders in genetics on scientific projects that may lead to important breakthroughs in science, medicine, and health. In other words, we may be heading toward a time when people can google their own genes.

The book gives good highlight as to why Google became big: search was just an incredibly computationally intensive task. From very early days, <Largey> were already making up their own somewhat custom compute systems from very early days, which naturally led into <Google custom hardware> later on. Google just managed to pull ahead on the reinvest revenue into hardware loop, and no one ever caught them back. This feels more the case than e.g. with <Amazon>, which notoriously had to buy off dozens of competitors to clear the way.

This section is about more "open" <PageRank> implementations, notably using either or both of:
* <open source software>
* <open web crawling> data such as <Common Crawl>

As of 2025, the most open and reproducible implementation appears to be whatever <Common Crawl web graph official PageRank> does, which is to use <WebGraph (software)>. It's quite beautiful.

Was adopted by AskJeeves in 2001.

<The Google Story> Chapter 11. "The Google Economy" comments:
> As they saw it, generation one was AltaVista, generation two was <Google>, and generation three was Teoma, or what Ask Jeeves came to refer to as Expert Rank. Teoma's technology involved mathematical formulas and calculations that went beyond Google's PageRank system, which was based on popularity. In fact, the concept had been cited in the original Stanford University paper written by Sergey Brin and Larry Page as one of the methods that could be used to rank indexed Web sites in response to search requests. "They called their method global popularity and they called this method local popularity, meaning you look more granularly at the Web and see who the authoritative sources are," Lanzone said. He said Brin an Page had concluded that local popularity would be exceedingly difficult to execute well, because either it would require too much processing power to do it in real time or it would take too long.

http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/03/expertrank-authoritative-search.html mentions
> ExpertRank is an evolution of IBM's CLEVER project, a search engine that never made it to public.
and:
> The difference between PageRank and ExpertRank is that for ExpertRank the quality of the page is important and that quality is not absolute, but it's relative to a subject.

Carl is mentioned in <The Google Story> Chapter 2 "When Larry Met Sergey".

He divorced from Larry's mother Gloria in 1980 or 1981, "when he \[Page\] was eight years old" according to <The Google Story>. He then moved on to <Joyce Wildenthal>, another MSU professor. Larry had a good relation with both Gloria and Joyce:
> Larry came to feel that he was showered with love and wisdom from two mothers: his real mom, and <Joyce Wildenthal>, a Michigan State professor who had a long-term relationship with his dad.

His obituary on the website of the <Michigan State University>, where he taught most of his life: https://www.cse.msu.edu/Alumni_Friends/Alumni/PageMemorial.php[]:
> Page served as CSE’s \[<Michigan State University>[MSU] Department of Computer Science and Engineering\] first graduate director and had a critical role in promoting the department’s research mission. In 1967, when he joined MSU, the computer science program consisted of only undergraduate courses. Just three years later, the department offered eighteen graduate courses in computer science.

  \[...\]

  Page taught courses in Automata and <Formal language theory> and <Artificial intelligence>. He was a beloved teacher and mentor to innumerable students until his death in 1996.

{title2=Larry Page's brother}
{title2=born 1963 or 1964}

<Larry Pages>'s older brother.

It is hard to find information on this little bugger! Not a single photo online!

As suggested by the "Jr.", he is named after Larry's father, <Carl Victor Page>.

Carl Jr. is mentioned in a few places in the book <The Google Story>. The full name "Carl Victor Page Jr." is never given in that source, only "Carl Page Jr." is used. These crazy <Anglo-Saxons> and their semi-optional <middle names>!

<The Google Story> does not cite its sources, but it likely got much of its insider information through interviews, e.g. Chapter 2. "When Larry Met Sergey":
> Carl Jr. recalls Larry as an inquisitive younger brother with wide-ranging interests
which suggests the authors actually interviewed Carl Jr., since interviews with Carl Jr. cannot be found anywhere else on the Internet. It would be interesting to know more how they got that level of access.

Chapter 2 mentions that Carl Jr. is nine years older than Larry. Therefore, he must have been born in 1963 or 1964. It also states that Carl studied at the <University of Michigan>, like <Carl Victor Page>[his father] and like Larry would also do later on:
> He also enjoyed helping Carl Jr. - who was nine years older - with his college computer homework when Carl came home from the <University of Michigan> during breaks.
<Carl Victor Page>[Their father] was a professor at the <Michigan State University>, which is a different university from the <University of Michigan>, and not in the same city, so by breaks they mean term breaks.

Chapter 2 also mentions that he was working in <Silicon Valley> by the time <Carl Victor Page>[their father] died in 1996:
> Despite his grief \[for the death of <Carl Victor Page>[their father] at the early age of 58\], Larry remained enrolled at <Stanford>. It helped that his older brother, Carl Jr., lived and worked in <Silicon Valley>. They had each other, so Larry wasn't left to bear the loss alone, and the two spent time together, fondly recalling their dad and reflecting on their childhood memories.

In 1997, Carl co-founded the <mailing list> management website <eGroups> together with <Scott Hassan>, programmer of an early version of <Google> when he was a research assistant at <Stanford University>. Carl and Scott presumably met through Larry, but we don't have a source. The company was sold to <Yahoo!> in 2000. <The Google Story> Chapter 8. "A Trickle" mentions:
> <Google>'s deal with <Yahoo!>\] had special significance for <Larry Page>, since his brother, <Carl Victor Page, Jr.>[Carl Jr.], also was in serious negotiations with <Yahoo!> over a major business transaction. The following day, June 27, Yahoo announced plans to buy <eGroups>, a technology firm that Carl Page had co-founded, for \$413 million.
Carl is listed as a co-founder in the <SEC> filing: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1105102/0000950149-00-000584.txt as "Carl Page". He does not appear on the 5% stockholders however, poor Carl.

In 2006, he brought a company he founded called "Handheld Entertainment" public through a reverse merger with a shell company: https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2006/03/21/brother-of-google-co-founder-uses-shell-company-for-handheld-start-up/[]. "Handheld Entertainment" made an <iPod> competitor apparently. <SEC> filing: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1309710/000095013606009480/file1.htm[].

<Wikidata> entry: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15791098

September 27, 2023 marked <Google>'s 25 th aniversary and the page https://cirosantilli.com/carl-victor-page-jr had a small surge of views according to <Google Analytics>. On that day, this page was one of the top Google search results for "Carl Victor Page, Jr."https://archive.ph/wip/hKt9K{ref}. Wikipedia also had a large bump in searches for "Larry Page" on the same day: https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&redirects=0&start=2023-09-11&end=2023-10-01&pages=Cat|Dog|Larry_Page which must be the root cause, Larry actually managed to beat "Cat" and "Dog" on that day.
