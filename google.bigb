One of the least <evil> of the big tech companies of the early 21st century, partly because <Sergey Brin>'s parents fled from the Soviet Union and so he is <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[anti censorship], although they https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine)[have been tempted by it].

Google only succeeds at highly algorithmic tasks or at giving infinite storage to users to then mine their data.

It is incapable however of adding any obvious useful end user features to most of its products, most of which get terminated and cannot be relied on:

Too many genius engineers. They need some dumber people like <Ciro Santilli> who <Ciro Santilli's bad old event memory>[need to write documentation to learn stuff].

<Ciro Santilli> actually attempted two interviews to work at Google in the early 2010's but very quickly failed both on the first phase, because you have to be a fast well trained coding machine to pass that interview.

Ciro later felt better about himself by fantasizing how he would actually do more important things outside of Google and that they would beg to buy him instead.

He was also happy that he wouldn't have to use Google crazy internal tools: someone once said that Google's tools make easy tasks middle hard, and they also make impossible tasks middle hard. TODO source.

But whatever the case: Ciro <grinding for software interviews>[will not, ever, spend his time drilling programmer competition problems to join a company].

The 1997 <Wayback Machine> archives are just priceless: https://web.archive.org/web/19971210065425/http://backrub.stanford.edu/backrub.html[]. I'm so glad that website exists and started so early. It is just another university research project demo website like any other. Priceless.

<Craig Silverstein> was the first employee hired, in 1998: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge

In August 1998 they had an their first investment of \$100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, <Sun Microsystems> co-founder. Some sources say September 1998. This was an event of legend, the dude dropped by, tested the website for a few minutes, said I like it, and dropped a 100\$ check with no paperwork. Google wasn't even incorporated, they had to incorporate to cash the check. They were apparently introduced by one of the teachers, TODO which. Some sources say he had to rush off to another meeting afterwards:
* https://www.dw.com/en/von-bechtolsheim-i-invested-in-google-to-solve-my-own-problem/a-4557608

Tried to sell it for 1 million in early 1999... OMG the way the world is. It would be good to learn more about that story, and when they noticed it was fuckup.

One of Google's most interesting stories is how their startup garage owner https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Wojcicki[became an important figure inside Google], and how Sergei https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Wojcicki[married her sister]. These were the best garage tenants ever!

{wiki}

The guy who coded the initial the <BackRub>, but left before the company formed. TODO how did he meet <Largey Brage>? Why did he leave Google?

He co0founded <EGroups> in 1997 with <Carl Victor Page Jr.>, <Larry Page>'s brother, and sold it to <Yahoo!> in 2000 for \$432m.

Married a Vietnamese Chick called Allison Huynh from university in 2001. Was unfaithful, and now does not want to split the cash? https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/who-is-scott-hassan-the-google-founder-accused-of-divorce-terrorism-10543641.htm Bro, be a man.

That article does mention that he has 13 B in Google shares he bought before IPO, but a net worth of only 1 B. He must have made some insane losses somewhere! It does feel like they gave him a privileged deal because of his early contributions, having that much for just 800 USD sounds unlikely. Hassan likely sold a good part of the shares too early.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9912929/Billionaire-investor-helped-launch-Google-accused-divorce-terrorism-bitter-break-up.html has even better information. He tried to strike a post-nuptial after google went public in 2004, which she declined. So things were already not perfect then. It mentions that the shares would be worth 13 B today, not that he holds them necessarily. He must have sold early.

To be fair, he did work on a lot of cool stuff, not the least the company that crated the <Robot Operating System>, which is a cool sounding project.

The fact that he does not have a <Wikipedia> page as of 2022 is mind blowing, especially after divorce details. Maybe <Ciro Santilli> will create it one day. Just no patience now. OK, done it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Hassan let's see if it lasts. The page lasted but an anonymous user with IP from <California> removed divorce details and google share ownership details in December 2022, both of which had a <New York Times> source: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/Scott-Hassan-Allison-Huynh-divorce.html[].

And he possibly unadvertedly exposed his real <IP> in doing so: 24.6.226.102. It is pingable, but <Nmap> analysis shows nothing of interest.

Company co-founded by <Scott Hassan>, early <Google> programmer at <Stanford University>, and <Carl Victor Page Jr.>, <Larry Page>'s older brother.

They were an email list management website, and became Yahoo! Groups after the aquisition.

The company was sold to <Yahoo!> in August 2000 for \$432m and became <Yahoo! Groups>. They managed to miraculously dodge the <Dot-com bubble>. After the acquisition, Yahoo started to redirect them to: http://groups.yahoo.com as can be seen on the <Wayback Machine>: http://web.archive.org/web/20000401000000*/egroups.com The first archive of https://groups.yahoo.com is from February 2001: http://web.archive.org/web/20010202055100/http://groups.yahoo.com/ and it unsurprisingly looks basically exactly like eGroups.

https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780385342728 on the <Internet Archive Open Library>.

Has some good mentions, but often leaves you wanting more details of how certain things happened, especially the early days stuff.

Does however paint a good picture of several notable employees, and non-search projects from the early 2000's including:
* the cook dude
* porn cookie guy
* the unusual IPO process

Paints a very positive picture of the founders. It is likely true. They gave shares generously to early employees. Tried to allow the more general public to buy from IPO, by using a bidding scheme, rather than focusing on the big bankers as was usual.

The introduction mentions that <Google> is very interested in <molecular biology> and mining <genetics> data, much like <Ciro Santilli>! Can't find external references however...
\Q[Two of the most compelling areas that Google and its founders are quietly working on are the promising fields of <molecular biology> and <genetics>. Millions of genes in combination with massive amounts of biological and scientific data are an excellent match for the Google search engine, the tremendous database the company has in place, and its immense computing power. Already, Google has downloaded a map of the human genome and is working closely with biologist Dr. <Craig Venter> and other leaders in genetics on scientific projects that may lead to important breakthroughs in science, medicine, and health. In other words, we may be heading toward a time when people can google their own genes.]

The book gives good highlight as to why Google became big: search was just an incredibly computationally intensive task. From very early days, <Largey> were already making up their own somewhat custom compute systems from very early days, which naturally led into <Google custom hardware> later on. Google just managed to pull ahead on the reinvest revenue into hardware loop, and no one ever caught them back. This feels more the case than e.g. with <Amazon>, which notoriously had to buy off dozens of competitors to clear the way.

Was adopted by AskJeeves in 2001.

<The Google Story> Chapter 11. "The Google Economy" comments:
\Q[As they saw it, generation one was AltaVista, generation two was <Google>, and generation three was Teoma, or what Ask Jeeves came to refer to as Expert Rank. Teoma's technology involved mathematical formulas and calculations that went beyond Google's PageRank system, which was based on popularity. In fact, the concept had been cited in the original Stanford University paper written by Sergey Brin and Larry Page as one of the methods that could be used to rank indexed Web sites in response to search requests. "They called their method global popularity and they called this method local popularity, meaning you look more granularly at the Web and see who the authoritative sources are," Lanzone said. He said Brin an Page had concluded that local popularity would be exceedingly difficult to execute well, because either it would require too much processing power to do it in real time or it would take too long.]

http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2006/03/expertrank-authoritative-search.html mentions
\Q[ExpertRank is an evolution of IBM's CLEVER project, a search engine that never made it to public.]
and:
\Q[The difference between PageRank and ExpertRank is that for ExpertRank the quality of the page is important and that quality is not absolute, but it's relative to a subject.]

<Larry Pages>'s older brother.

It is hard to find information on this little bugger! Not a single photo online!

As suggested by the "Jr.", he is named after Larry's father, <Carl Victor Page>.

Carl Jr. is mentioned in a few places in the book <The Google Story>. The full name "Carl Victor Page Jr." is never given in that source, only "Carl Page Jr." is used. These crazy <Anglo-Saxons> and their semi-optional <middle names>!

<The Google Story> does not cite its sources, but it likely got much of its insider information through interviews, e.g. Chapter 2. "When Larry Met Sergey":
\Q[Carl Jr. recalls Larry as an inquisitive younger brother with wide-ranging interests]
which suggests the authors actually interviewed Carl Jr., since interviews with Carl Jr. cannot be found anywhere else on the Internet. It would be interesting to know more how they got that level of access.

Chapter 2 mentions that Carl Jr. is nine years older than Larry. Therefore, he must have been born in 1963 or 1964. It also states that Carl studied at the <University of Michigan>, like <Carl Victor Page>[his father] and like Larry would also do later on:
\Q[He also enjoyed helping Carl Jr. - who was nine years older - with his college computer homework when Carl came home from the <University of Michigan> during breaks.]
<Carl Victor Page>[Their father] was a professor at the <Michigan State University>, which is a different university from the <University of Michigan>, and not in the same city, so by breaks they mean term breaks.

Chapter 2 also mentions that he was working in <Silicon Valley> by the time <Carl Victor Page>[their father] died in 1996: 
\Q[Despite his grief \[for the death of <Carl Victor Page>[their father] at the early age of 58\], Larry remained enrolled at <Stanford>. It helped that his older brother, Carl Jr., lived and worked in <Silicon Valley>. They had each other, so Larry wasn't left to bear the loss alone, and the two spent time together, fondly recalling their dad and reflecting on their childhood memories.]

In 1997, Carl co-founded the <mailing list> management website <eGroups> together with <Scott Hassan>, programmer of an early version of <Google> when he was a research assistant at <Stanford University>. Carl and Scott presumably met through Larry, but we don't have a source. The company was sold to <Yahoo!> in 2000. <The Google Story> Chapter 8. "A Trickle" mentions:
\Q[<Google>'s deal with <Yahoo!>\] had special significance for <Larry Page>, since his brother, <Carl Victor Page Jr.>[Carl Jr.], also was in serious negotiations with <Yahoo> over a major business transaction. The following day, June 27, Yahoo announced plans to buy <eGroups>, a technology firm that Carl Page had co-founded, for \$413 million.]
Carl is listed as a co-founder in the <SEC> filing: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1105102/0000950149-00-000584.txt as "Carl Page". He does not appear on the 5% stockholders however, poor Carl.

In 2006, he brought a company he founded called "Handheld Entertainment" public through a reverse merger with a shell company: https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2006/03/21/brother-of-google-co-founder-uses-shell-company-for-handheld-start-up/[]. "Handheld Entertainment" made an <iPod> competitor apparently. <SEC> filing: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1309710/000095013606009480/file1.htm[].

September 27, 2023 marked <Google>'s 25 th aniversary and the page https://cirosantilli.com/carl-victor-page-jr had a small surge of views according to <Google Analytics>. On that day, this page was one of the top Google search results for "Carl Victor Page, Jr."https://archive.ph/wip/hKt9K{ref}. Wikipedia also had a large bump in searches for "Larry Page" on the same day: https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&redirects=0&start=2023-09-11&end=2023-10-01&pages=Cat|Dog|Larry_Page which must be the root cause, Larry actually managed to beat "Cat" and "Dog" on that day.

She's truly passionate about health research and keeping healthy, almost obsessed by it. Also she's strong willed, and energetic. Good traits for founding <23andMe>.

As https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/style/anne-wojcicki-23andme-genetics.html puts it well:
\Q[The Wojcickis grew into Silicon Valley royalty. It’s the sort of family, Anne jokes, where “you’re only a viable fetus once you have your Ph.D.]

She's athletic! As mentioned at: https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/04/sergey-brin-amanda-rosenberg-affair[]. And despite the name, and unlike Sergey, she's completely american as seen from her perfect accent!

* https://youtu.be/pDoALM0q1LA?t=331 why she's obsessed with healthcare. Also mentioned at: https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/04/sergey-brin-amanda-rosenberg-affair how she was trying to save Sergei from some of his genetic predispositions
* https://youtu.be/pDoALM0q1LA?t=571 she really cared about <23andMe>, but the public didn't as much as her. She's truly passionate about mining genetic data. Maybe she came a bit early.
