One of the least <evil> of the big tech companies of the early 21st century, partly because https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin[Sergey's] parents fled from the Soviet Union and so he is <ciro santilli s campaign for freedom of speech in china>[anti censorship], although they https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine)[have been tempted by it].

Google only succeeds at highly algorithmic tasks or at giving infinite storage to users to then mine their data.

It is incapable however of adding any obvious useful end user features to most of its products, most of which get terminated and cannot be relied on:

This also seems to extend to <business to business>: https://twitter.com/MohapatraHemant/status/1343969802080030720 ex-Googler tells how they lost the cloud to <amazon company>.

Too many genius engineers. They need some dumber people like <ciro santilli> who <ciro santilli s bad old event memory>[need to write documentation to learn stuff].

<ciro santilli> actually attempted two interviews to work at Google in the early 2010's but very quickly failed both on the first phase, because you have to be a fast well trained coding machine to pass that interview.

Ciro later felt better about himself by fantasizing how he would actually do more important things outside of Google and that they would beg to buy him instead.

He was also happy that he wouldn't have to use Google crazy internal tools: someone once said that Google's tools make easy tasks middle hard, and they also make impossible tasks middle hard. TODO source.

But whatever the case: Ciro <grinding for software interviews>[will not, ever, spend his time drilling programmer competition problems to join a company].

The 1997 <wayback machine> archives are just priceless: https://web.archive.org/web/19971210065425/http://backrub.stanford.edu/backrub.html[]. I'm so glad that website exists and started so early. It is just another university research project demo website like any other. Priceless.

<craig silverstein> was the first employee hired, in 1998: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge

In August 1998 they had an their first investment of \$100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, <sun microsystems> co-founder. Some sources say September 1998. This was an event of legend, the dude dropped by, tested the website for a few minutes, said I like it, and dropped a 100\$ check with no paperwork. Google wasn't even incorporated, they had to incorporate to cash the check. They were apparently introduced by one of the teachers, TODO which. Some sources say he had to rush off to another meeting afterwards:
* https://www.dw.com/en/von-bechtolsheim-i-invested-in-google-to-solve-my-own-problem/a-4557608

Tried to sell it for 1 million in early 1999... OMG the way the world is. It would be good to learn more about that story, and when they noticed it was fuckup.

One of Google's most interesting stories is how their startup garage owner https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Wojcicki[became an important figure inside Google], and how Sergei https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Wojcicki[married her sister]. These were the best garage tenants ever!

Andy showed up at 8AM, and he had a meeting at 9AM at <Cisco> where he worked, so he had to leav early. Andy worked at Cisco after having sold his company Granite Systems, which David co-founded, to Cisco. Particularly cool to see how Andy calculated expected revenue quickly on the back of his mind.}

{wiki}

The guy who coded the initial the <backrub>, but left before the company formed. TODO how did he meet <Largey Brage>? Why did he leave google?

He founded <EGroups> in 1997, and sold it to <Yahoo> in 2000 for \$432m.

Married a Vietnamese Chick called Allison Huynh from university in 2001. Was unfaithful, and now does not want to split the cash? https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/who-is-scott-hassan-the-google-founder-accused-of-divorce-terrorism-10543641.htm Bro, be a man.

That article does mention that he has 13 B in Google shares he bought before IPO, but a net worth of only 1 B. He must have made some insane losses somewhere! It does feel like they gave him a privileged deal because of his early contributions, having that much for just 800 USD sounds unlikely.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9912929/Billionaire-investor-helped-launch-Google-accused-divorce-terrorism-bitter-break-up.html has even better information. He tried to strike a post-nuptial after google went public in 2004, which she declined. So things were already not perfect then. It mentions that the shares would be worth 13 B today, not that he holds them necessarily. He must have sold early.

To be fair, he did work on a lot of cool stuff, not the least the company that crated the <robot operating system>, which is a cool sounding project.

The fact that he does not have a wiki page as of 2022 is mind blowing, especially after divorce details. Maybe <ciro santilli> will create it one day. Just no patience now. OK, done it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Hassan let's see if it lasts.

Has some good mentions, but often leaves you wanting more details of how certain things happened, especially the early days stuff.

The introduction mentions that <Google> is very interested in <molecular biology> and mining <genetics> data, much like <Ciro Santilli>! Can't find external references however...
\Q[Two of the most compelling areas that Google and its founders are quietly working on are the promising fields of <molecular biology> and <genetics>. Millions of genes in combination with massive amounts of biological and scientific data are an excellent match for the Google search engine, the tremendous database the company has in place, and its immense computing power. Already, Google has downloaded a map of the human genome and is working closely with biologist Dr. <Craig Venter> and other leaders in genetics on scientific projects that may lead to important breakthroughs in science, medicine, and health. In other words, we may be heading toward a time when people can google their own genes.]

\Q[At Google, the preference is for working in small teams of three, with individual employees expected to allot 20 percent of their time to exploring whatever ideas interest them most. The notion of "20 percent time" is borrowed from the academic world, where professors are given one day a week to pursue private interests.]
