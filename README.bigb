Check out: https://OurBigBook.com[]. Mission: to live in a world where you can learn <university>-level <mathematics>, <physics>, <chemistry>, <biology> and <engineering> from perfect free open source books that anyone can write to get famous.

Further information: <OurBigBook.com>{full}. <sponsor>[Sponsor Ciro] at https://github.com/sponsors/cirosantilli[] starting from 1<Dollar>[[$]]/month so he can work full time to bring hardcore <university>-level <STEM> education to all ages.

<Ciro Santilli> is a <free gifted education> and <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[freedom of speech] <slacktivist>. <effortless effort>[Passion] for the <natural sciences>, <education> and <computers>. <Ciro Santilli's cycling>[Recreational cyclist]. <Tax the rich>. Opinions are his own, but they could be yours too.

I offer:
* online private tutoring for:
  * any <STEM> university course
  * passionate younger <STEM> students (any age) who want to learn university level material and beyond. Can your kid be the next <Fields Medalist> or <Nobel Prize> winner? I'm here to help, especially if you are filthy rich! I focus <Students must be allowed to progress as fast as they want>[moving students forward as fast as they want] on and on <how to teach/Projects must aim for novelty>[producing useful novel tutorials and results]
* educational consulting for institutions looking to improve their <STEM> courses
  * do you know \i[that] course or teacher that consistently gets bad reviews every year? I'll work with the teacher to turn the problem around!
  * are you looking to create a consistent <open educational resources> offering to increase your institutions internationally visibility? I can help with that too.
My approach is to learn the material with the student(s), and publish any missing tutorials as <freely licensed> tutorials online. I have <articles>[a proven track of explaining complex concepts in an interesting and useful way]. I work for the learner. Teaching statement at: <How to teach>{full}. Pricing to be discussed.

Let's <the ideal university>[create an educational system] with:
* no distinction between <university> and <high school>, <students must have a flexible choice of what to learn>[students just go as fast as they can to what they really want] without stupid <university entry exams>
* <OurBigBook.com>[fully open source learning material]
* <exam as a service>[on-demand examinations that anyone can easily take without prerequisites]
* <the only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories>[granular entry selection only for space in specific laboratories] or participation in specific <novel research> projects

A quick <2D continuous AI game> prototype for <reinforcement learning> written in <Matter.js>, you can view it on a separate page at https://cirosantilli.com/_raw/js/matterjs/examples.html#top-down-asdw-fixed-viewport[]. This is a for-fun-only prototype for <Ciro's 2D reinforcement learning games>, <C++> or maybe <Python> (for the <deep learning> ecosystem) seems inevitable for a serious version of such a project. But it is cute how much you can do with a few lines of <Matter.js>!
