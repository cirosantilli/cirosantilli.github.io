Check out: https://OurBigBook.com[]. Mission: to live in a world where you can learn <university>-level <mathematics>, <physics>, <chemistry>, <biology> and <engineering> from perfect free <open source> books that anyone can write to get famous. Further information: <OurBigBook.com>{full}

<sponsor>[Sponsor me to work on this project]: 100k <USD> = I quit me job and work on it one year full time. Status: ~16k USD / 100k USD reached. How to donate: <sponsor>{full}.

<Ciro Santilli's documentation superpowers>[Explaining things is my superpower], e.g. I was top user \#39 on <Stack Overflow> in 2023https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/year/stackoverflow/2023-01-01{ref}<Ciro Santilli's Stack Overflow contributions>{ref} and I have a few 1k+ star educational <GitHub> repositorieshttps://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat{ref}<linux kernel module cheat>{ref}https://github.com/cirosantilli/x86-bare-metal-examples{ref}. Now I want to bring that level of awesomeness to <Master's degree>[masters level] <Mathematics> and <Physics>. But I can't do it alone! So I'm creating <OurBigBook.com> to allow everyone to work together towards the perfect book of everything.

My life's goal is to bring hardcore <university>-level <STEM> <open educational content> to all ages. Sponsor me at https://github.com/sponsors/cirosantilli[] starting from 1<Dollar>[[$]]/month so I can work full time on it. Further information: <sponsor>{full}. Achieving what I call "<free gifted education>" is my <Nirvana>.

Besides that, I'm also a <Ciro Santilli's campaign for freedom of speech in China>[freedom of speech] <slacktivist> and <Ciro Santilli's cycling>[recreational cyclist]. Opinions are my own, but they could be yours too.

I offer:
* online private tutoring for:
  * any <STEM> university course
  * passionate younger <STEM> students (any age) who want to learn university level material and beyond. Can your kid be the next <Fields Medalist> or <Nobel Prize> winner? I'm here to help, especially if you are filthy rich! I focus <Students must be allowed to progress as fast as they want>[moving students forward as fast as they want] on and on <how to teach/Projects must aim for novelty>[producing useful novel tutorials and results]
* educational consulting for institutions looking to improve their <STEM> courses
  * do you know \i[that] course or teacher that consistently gets bad reviews every year? I'll work with the teacher to turn the problem around!
  * are you looking to create a consistent <open educational resources> offering to increase your institutions internationally visibility? I can help with that too.
My approach is to learn the material with the student(s), and publish any missing tutorials as <freely licensed> tutorials online. I have <articles>[a proven track of explaining complex concepts in an interesting and useful way]. I work for the learner. Teaching statement at: <How to teach>{full}. Pricing to be discussed. Contact details at: <How to contact Ciro Santilli>{full}.

Let's <the ideal university>[create an educational system] with:
* no distinction between <university> and <high school>, <students must have a flexible choice of what to learn>[students just go as fast as they can to what they really want] without stupid <university entry exams>
* <OurBigBook.com>[fully open source learning material]
* <exam as a service>[on-demand examinations that anyone can easily take without prerequisites]
* <the only reason for universities to exist should be the laboratories>[granular entry selection only for space in specific laboratories] or participation in specific <novel research> projects

{description=Artist unknown, uploaded December 2014. Part of <Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain>{full} where <Ciro Santilli> maintains a curated list of such interesting inscriptions.

This was a small project done by Ciro for <artistic> purposes that received some attention due to the incredible hype surrounding <cryptocurrencies> at the time. <Ciro Santilli>'s views on  <cryptocurrencies> are summarized at: <Are cryptocurrencies useful?>{full}.

{description=
<JPG> image fully embedded in the <Bitcoin blockchain> depicting some kind of cut material art depicting a yellow robot, <inscription (blockchain)>[inscribed] on https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/4cbb32cd27b5b5edc12d3559bdffc1355ac2a210463d5cfaadc7ce9b06675b2b[January 29, 2017].

<Ciro Santilli> found this image and others during his research for <cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain>{full} by searching for image fingerprints on every transaction payload of the blockchain with a script.

The image was uploaded by <EMBII>, co-creator of the <Cool data embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain/AtomSea & EMBII> upload mechanism, which was responsible for a large part of the image <inscription (blockchain)>[inscriptions] in the <Bitcoin blockchain>.

The associated message reads:
\Q[Chiharu \[<EMBII>'s Japanese wife\] and I found this little yellow robot while exploring Chicago. It will be covered by tar or eventually removed but this tribute will remain. N 41.880778 E -87.629210]
This is one of <Ciro Santilli>'s favorite AtomSea & EMBII uploads, as it perfectly encapsules the "medium as an artform" approach to blockchain art, where even non-novel works can be recontextualized into something interesting, here depicting an opposition between the ephemeral and the immutable.

At https://twitter.com/EMBII4U/status/1615389973343268871 <EMBII> announced that he would be giving off shares of that image on <Sup!? (Bitcoin-based social media)>, a <Bitcoin>-backed <NFT> system he was; making. In December 2023, he gave some shares of the robot to <Ciro Santilli>.

A quick <2D continuous AI game> prototype for <reinforcement learning> written in <Matter.js>, you can view it on a separate page at https://cirosantilli.com/_raw/js/matterjs/examples.html#top-down-asdw-fixed-viewport[]. This is a for-fun-only prototype for <Ciro's 2D reinforcement learning games>, <C++> or maybe <Python> (for the <deep learning> ecosystem) seems inevitable for a serious version of such a project. But it is cute how much you can do with a few lines of <Matter.js>!
