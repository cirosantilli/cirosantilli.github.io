Ciro Santilli is a \x[male] \x[human] \x[software-engineer] and \x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china][activist] \x[ciro-santilli-s-biography][born] in \x[brazil], \x[earth] in 1989 AD.

Quick facts:
* Nationalities: \x[italian] and \x[brazilian]
* Grew up in: \x[brazil]
* Relationship status 2017-: \x[ciro-santilli-s-wife][married]
* \x[chinese-language] name: 三西猴, means "three western monkeys". Phonetic approximation to SANtilli CIRO. Semi-unintentionally reminds \x[chinese] people of \x[image-19th-century-illustration-of-the-journey-to-the-west-protagonist-sun-wukong][Sun Wukong (孙悟空)]. Given by \x[ciro-santilli-s-wife], then girlfriend, as a semi-joke, and he took it up because the best way to take a joke is to play along with the joker.
* Laptop: high end \x[thinkpad][Lenovo ThinkPad]
* \x[distro]: latest \x[ubuntu] release
* \x[vim] or Emacs: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/e1vh8n/from_now_on_my_pronoun_is_vivim/[vi/vim]. But for The Love, will someone please make an open source \x[c-plus-plus] \x[integrated-development-environment] that actually just works?
* Tabs or spaces: spaces
* \x[mailing-list]{c} or \x[git](\x[github][Hub]|\x[gitlab][Lab]): Git(Hub|Lab), with passion, see \x[mailing-list]{full}
* System or unit tests: system
* \x[programming-language]{p}: \x[python] and \x[c-plus-plus]. He'll learn Rust and \x[haskell] once he's rich.

* Metric or \x[imperial-units][imperial]: metric, for The Love. \x[international-system-of-units][Science]? \x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world][Standardization]? 21st century anyone?
* QWERTY or Dvorak: QWERTY, alas

{title=19th century illustration of the \x[journey-to-the-west] protagonist \x[sun-wukong].}
{description=\x[sun-wukong] (孙悟空) is a playful and obscenely powerful monkey Journey to the West. He protects a \x[buddhist] monk, and likes \x[ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology][eating fruit, just like Ciro]. Oh, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goku[Goku] from \x[children-cartoons-ciro-santilli-liked-to-watch][Dragon Ball] is based on him. His \x[japanese-language] name \i[is] "Sun Wukong" (same \x[chinese-character]{p} with different Japanese pronunciation) for the love. His given name "Wukong" means literally "the one who mastered the void", which is \x[physics-and-the-illusion-of-life][fucking awesome]. This is another sad instance of a \x[chinese-thing-better-known-in-the-west-as-japanese].}

\x[ciro-santilli] has sometimes wasted time with low impact projects such as those listed at \x[ciro-santilli-s-minor-projects] instead of doing higher impact projects such as those mentioned at: \x[the-most-important-projects-ciro-santilli-wants-to-do]{full}.

But maybe "Everything you did brought you where you are now." applies, maybe it is during the "low impact activities" that one gets the inspiration and experience required for the "high impact ones".

https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat

\x[dan-kaminsky-approves-linux-kernel-module-cheat].

This is the most important technical tutorial project that \x[ciro-santilli] has done in his life so far as of 2019.

The scope is insane and unprecedented, and goes beyond \x[linux-kernel]-land alone, which is where it started.

It ended up \x[eating] every system programming content Ciro had previously written! Including:
* \x[c-programming-language], \x[c-plus-plus], \x[posix]
* \x[x86] and arm userland assembly
* arm baremetal assembly. x86 baremetal is at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/x86-bare-metal-examples and would in theory be migrated, but he's lazy
* \x[qemu] and gem5 emulation
so that that repo would better be called "System Programming Cheat". But "Linux Kernel Module Cheat" sounds more hardcore ;-)

Other major things that could be added there as well in the future are:
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/algorithm-cheat
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture[computer architecture] tutorials with gem5

Due to this project, some have https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/issues/105#issuecomment-553220982[considered Ciro to be] (https://web.archive.org/web/20191113151131/https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/issues/105#issuecomment-553220982[archive]):
\Q[some kind of Linux kernel god.]
which made Ciro smile, although "Linux kernel documenter \x[god]" would have been more precise.

\Image[https://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/895245.png?theme=dark]
{title=Ciro Santilli's amazing \x[stack-overflow] profile.}
{height=58}

\x[ciro-santilli]'s \x[stack-overflow] contributions have, unsurprisingly, centered around the subjects he has worked with: \x[systems-programming] and \x[web-development], and necessary tooling to get those done, such as \x[git], \x[python], \x[bash] and \x[ubuntu].

His best answers are listed at: \x[articles]{full}.

Stack Overflow has been the initial centerpiece of \x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china].

In Stack Overflow Ciro likes to:
* answer important questions found through \x[google] which he needs to solve an actual problem he has right now, and for which none of the existing answers satisfied him, and close duplicates.
* monitor less known tags which very few people know a lot about and where the knowledge sharing desperately lacking, but in which Ciro specializes and therefore has some uncommon knowledge to share

In practice it also happens that Ciro:
* Googles for his own answers to remember some detail he wrote down but with slightly different terms that were closer to mind at the time, and find other similar questions for which he has the perfect answer.
* learns something new by chance, e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39933567/deduce-stdarray-size/61371303#61371303[some new flashy feature of a new version of the C++ standard], thiks \x[the-machiavellian-stack-overflow-contributor]["this is awesome, there must be a Stack Overflow question for it"], and then there is a question and he answers it

When he gets an upvote on one of his more obscure answers, Ciro often re-reads it, and often finds improvements to be made and makes them.

He doesn't like to refresh the homepage looking for easy reputation on widely known subjects. See also: \x[online-forums-that-lock-threads-after-some-time-are-evil].

For this reason, https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/17/necromancer[Necromancer] is Ciro's favorite badge (get 5 upvotes on a question older than 60 days), and as of July 2019, https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/300735/users-with-most-necromancer-badges-at-a-given-date?Date=2019-07-15[he became the #1 user with the most of this badge]. Announcement https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/1146157392343785474[on Twitter].

The number two at the time was https://stackoverflow.com/users/6309/vonc[VonC], who had about 16 times more answers than Ciro in total! From this query: https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/1072396?&Date=2019-07-01&UserId=895245 it can be seen that as of July 2019, 1216 out of his 1329 answers were answered 60 days after the questions and constitute potential necromancers! Compare that to VonC's 1643 potential necromancers out of 21767 answers!

In terms of per \x[year] reputation ranks, Ciro was in the top 100 in of the 2018 ranking with 38,710 reputation gained in that year: https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/year/stackoverflow/2018-01-01?sort=reputationchange&page=4 (http://web.archive.org/web/20191013085259/https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/year/stackoverflow/2018-01-01?sort=reputationchange&page=4[archive]). Note that daily reputation is mostly capped to \x[stack-overflow-maximum-200-daily-reputation-limit][200 per day], leading to a maximum 73000 per year. It is possible to overcome this limit either with bounties or accepts, and Ciro finds it amazing that some people actually break the 73k limit by far with accepts, e.g. \x[gordon-linoff] reached https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/year/stackoverflow/2018-01-01?sort=reputationchange[135k in 2018] (https://web.archive.org/web/20191013090451/https://stackexchange.com/leagues/1/year/stackoverflow/2018-01-01?sort=reputationchange[archive])! However, this is something that Ciro will never do, because it implies answering thousands and thousands of useless semi duplicate questions as fast as possible to get the accept. Ciro's reputation comes purely from upvotes on important question, and is therefore sustainable without any extra effort once achieved. Interestingly, Ciro appeared on top of the quarter SE rankings around 2019-11: http://web.archive.org/web/20191112100606/https://stackexchange.com/leagues but it was https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/337643/mismatch-between-the-top-users-in-the-stack-exchange-league-and-period-wise-repo[just a bug] ;-)

There is no joy like answering an old question, and watching your better answer go up little by little until it dominates all others.

Stack Overflow reputation is of course, in itself, meaningless. People who contribute to popular subjects like web development will always have infinitely more reputation than those that contribute to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37879954/how-to-write-an-integer-to-stdout-as-hexadecimal-in-vhdl[low level subjects].

What happens on the specialized topics though is that you end up getting to know all the 5 users who contribute 95% of the content pretty soon as you study those subjects.

Like everything that man does, the majority of Ciro's answers are more or less superficial subjects that many people know but few have the patience to explain well, or they are updates to important questions \x[the-machiavellian-stack-overflow-contributor][reflecting upstream developments]. But as long as they save 15 minutes from someone's life, that's fine.

For example, Ciro's most upvoted answer as of July 2019 is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18875674/whats-the-difference-between-dependencies-devdependencies-and-peerdependencies/22004559#22004559 was written when he spent his first week playing with NodeJS (he was having a look at \x[overleaf], later merged into https://www.overleaf.com/[Overleaf], for \x[ourbigbook-com][education]), which he didn't touch again for several years, and still hasn't "mastered" as of 2019! This did teach a concrete life lesson to Ciro however: it is impossible to know what is the most useful thing you can do right now very precisely. The best bet is to follow your instincts and do as much awesome stuff as you can, and then, with some luck, some of those attempts will cover an use case.

Ciro tends to take most pride on his systems programming answers, which is a subject that truly relatively few people know about.

Ciro also derives great joy from his "media related answers" (3D graphics, audio, video), which are immensely fun to write, and sometimes borderline \x[art], see answers such as those under "OpenGL" and "Media" under \x[articles] or even simpler answers such as:
* https://askubuntu.com/questions/648603/how-to-create-an-animated-gif-from-mp4-video-via-command-line/837574#837574[How to create an animated GIF from MP4 video via command line?]

  \Image[STS-132_Liftoff_Space_Shuttle_Atlantis_512x.gif]
  {title=\x[ciro-santilli][Ciro] knows https://askubuntu.com/questions/648603/how-to-create-an-animated-gif-from-mp4-video-via-command-line/837574#837574[how to convert videos to GIFs].}
* https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/82112/stereo-tone-generator-for-linux/536860#536860[Stereo "tone-generator" for linux?]

Ciro's deep understanding of Stack Overflow mechanisms and its shortcomings also helped shape his ideas for: \x[ourbigbook-com]. So it is a bit funny to think that after all time Ciro spent on the \x[website], he actually wants to destroy it and replace it with something better. There can be no innovation without some damage. It also led to Ciro's creation of \x[stack-overflow-vote-fraud-script].

After answering so many questions, he ended up converging to a more or less consistent style, which he formalized at: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18614/style-guide-for-questions-and-answers/326746#326746 Like any other style guide, this answer style guide, once fully incorporated and memorized, allows Ciro to write answers faster, without thinking about formatting issues.

Ciro also made a question title style guide: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10647/how-do-i-write-a-good-title/311903#311903 but for some reason the Stack Overflow community prefers their semi-defined title meta-language to proper English. Go figure.

Ciro started contributing to Stack Overflow in 2012 when he was at \x[ecole-polytechnique].

Like all things that end up shaping the course of one's life, Ciro started contributing without thinking too much about it.

His first answer was to the LaTeX question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2701902/standalone-diagrams-with-tikz/9177804#9177804[Standalone diagrams with TikZ?], which reflects the fact that this happened while Ciro was reaching his \x[ciro-santilli-s-open-source-enlightenment].

Ciro's first upvote was for his 2012 question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10002291/how-to-run-a-python-script-portably-without-specifying-its-full-path[How to run a Python script portably without specifying its full path?]

When he started contributing, Ciro was still a newbie. One early event he will never forget was when someone mentioned a "man page", and Ciro commented saying that there was a typo!

When Ciro reached 15 points and gained the ability to upvote, it felt like a major milestone, he even took a screenshot of the browser! 1k, 10k and 100k were also particularly exciting. When the https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/291791/what-do-i-get-with-100k-reputation[100k cup] (https://web.archive.org/web/20160528230715/https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/291791/what-do-i-get-with-100k-reputation[archive]) arrived in 2018, Ciro made a https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1879889632030375[show-off Facebook post] (https://web.archive.org/web/20191020194239/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1879889632030375[archive]). At some point though, your brain stops caring, and automatically filters out any upvotes you get except on the answers that you are really proud of and which don't yet have lots of upvotes. The last remaining useless gamed achievement that Ciro looked forward to was https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/146/legendary[legendary] (https://web.archive.org/web/20191014113759/https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/146/legendary[archive]), and which he https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/146/legendary?userid=895245[achieved on 2021-02-16].

\Image[Ciro_Santilli_with_his_Stack_Overflow_100k_reputation_cup.jpg]
{title=\x[ciro-santilli] with his \x[stack-overflow] 100k reputation cup.}

From the start, Ciro's motivations for contributing to Stack Overflow have been a virtuous circle of:
* save the world through \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][free education]
* \x[ciro-santilli-s-selfish-desires][become famous]

  It feels especially amazing when people in the real world start taking note of you, and either close friends tell you straight out that you're a Stack Overflow God, or as you slowly and indirectly find out that less close know or came to you due to your amazing contributions.

It is also amazing when you start having a repertoire of answers, and as you are writing a new answer, you remember: "hey, the knowledge of that answer would be so welcome here", and so you link to the other answer as well at the perfect point. This somewhat achieves does what \x[ourbigbook-com] aims to do: for each small section of a tutorial, gather the best answers by multiple people.

Ciro feels that his Stack Overflow \x[ciro-santilli-s-e-soulmates][alter ego] is the user https://stackoverflow.com/users/55075/kenorb[kenorb], which has a surprisingly similar contribution pattern (one of the top necromancers) and subjects (Python, Bash). Ciro tried to contact him to say hi, but it was hard to find a contact. kenorb, feel free to send Ciro a hi one of those days.

Another one is https://stackoverflow.com/users/541136/aaron-hall[Aaron Hall], who is also very high on the necromancer list, answers in Python which is a topic Ciro cares about, and https://web.archive.org/web/20200120043703/https://stackoverflow.com/users/541136/aaron-hall[states on his profile]:
\Q[Follow me on Twitter and tell me what canonical questions you would like me to respond to!]
so another necromancer.

Way to go.

Ciro also https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245/?tab=questions[asks some questions] on a ratio of about 1 question per 10 answers. But Ciro's questions tend to be about extremely niche that no one knows/cares about, and a high percentage of them ends up getting self answered either at asking time or after later research.

https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship

Since 2015 \x[ciro-santilli] has carried out a campaign to promote \x[freedom-of-speech] in \x[china].

The campaign has centered around https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/tree/714d8104549ea19714787f148ff93c7403fd120c#why-keyword-attack[publishing censored keywords] on his \x[stack-overflow] username, thus using his \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions][considerable Stack Overflow presence] to sabotage the website in China. Here is an early http://web.archive.org/web/20150602004401/https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245/ciro-santilli-%e5%85%ad%e5%9b%9b%e4%ba%8b%e4%bb%b6-%e6%b3%95%e8%bd%ae%e5%8a%9f-%e7%ba%b3%e7%b1%b3%e6%af%94%e4%ba%9a%e8%83%a1%e6%b5%b7%e5%b3%b0[web archive].

Like most people in the West, Ciro has always been for political freedom of speech, and therefore against the \x[chinese-government]'s policies.

However, the seriousness of the matter only fully dawned on him in 2015 when, his mother-in-law, a then a 63-year-old lady, https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/tree/f2ba65accdfb51c8028aa9d4e37e9fe26400f0dc#jail-post[was put into jail for 15 days for doing Falun Gong].

And all of this was made 100 times worse because Ciro deeply loves several aspects of China, such as food, language, art and culture, and saw it all being destroyed by the Communists: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/does-ciro-santilli-hate-china

The rationale of this is to force the \x[chinese-government] to either:
* leave things as they are, and let censored keywords appear on Stack Overflow (most likely scenario)
* block \x[stack-overflow], and lose billions of dollars with worse IT technology
* disable the Great Firewall

In the beginning, this https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/tree/236407528ab6424504e442e070d632496c110087#backlinks-to-this-repository[generated some commotion], but activity reduced as novelty wore off, and as he collected the reply to all possible comments at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship.

This campaign has led him to have an insane profile view/reputation ratio, since many people pause to look at his profile. He is point "A" at the top right corner of \x[image-scatter-plot-of-stack-overflow-user-reputation-vs-profile-views-in-march-2019-with-ciro-santilli-marked-as-a]{full}:

{description=The A is towards the top right corner.}

Ciro feels that the view count started increasing more slowly since 2020 compared to his reputation, likely every single Chinese user has already viewed the profile.

These are some smaller projects that \x[ciro-santilli] carried out. They are all either for fun, or misguided use of his time done by an younger self:
* Naughty stuff. Ciro likes \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-creative-personality][being naughty]:
  * \x[stack-overflow-vote-fraud-script]
  * \x[github] makes Ciro feel especially naughty:
    * \x[all-github-commit-emails]: he extracted (almost) all Git commit emails from \x[github] with \x[google] BigQuery
    * \x[facebook-profile-face-dump]
    * https://github.com/cirosantilli/test-many-commits-1m/[A repository with 1 million commits]: likely the https://www.quora.com/Which-GitHub-repo-has-the-most-commits/answer/Ciro-SantilliI[live repo with the most commits as of 1017]

It was consuming too much \x[server] resources however, which led to GitHub admins manually https://web.archive.org/web/20151021135921/https://github.com/cirosantilli/[turning off his contribution history].
    * https://github.com/cirosantilli/test-octopus-100k[A repository with a 100k commit Git octopus merge]. Now that is a true https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/314215/can-a-git-commit-have-more-than-2-parents/377903#377903[Cthulhu merge].
    * https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1718[500 on adoc infinite header xref recursion]: that was fun while it lasted
    * \x[node-express-sequelize-next-js-realworld-example-app]
* Because Ciro \x[ourbigbook-com][cares about education], around 2014 he looked into markup languages and version control for books, before he noticed that this approach was useless and that ranking algorithms are all that matter:
  * \x[gitlab]: very important to Ciro because he wanted to base https://github.com/booktree/booktree[Booktree] on it.

    He was https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/graphs/contributors?from=2013-01-01&to=2015-01-01&type=a[the number 2 contributor from 2013 to 2015].

    He implemented some large features and several smaller improvements.

    For this reason, Ciro was made a moderator of https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab[/r/gitlab] in https://web.archive.org/web/20160524164714/https://www.reddit.com/r/gitlab/about/moderators[2016-05].

    GitLab sent Ciro a free swag bottle later after they got funding on to thank him for his contributions: \x[image-ciro-santilli-in-a-dune-lake-in-jericoacoara-brazil-with-his-gitlab-bottle]{full}. He had to pay for the beach trip though.

  * \a[markdown-style-guide][Markdown Style Guide]{check=0}
  * \x[karlcow-markdown-testsuite] improvements: Ciro has implemented the test runner a few months before CommonMark left stealth mode and killed it instantaneously.

    At least MacFarlane was able to https://github.com/jgm/CommonMark/blob/2528c87c0cf08e02eb3e201c149cb3acf521e0c8/test/normalize.py#L8[reuse] part of the \x[html] normalizer https://github.com/karlcow/markdown-testsuite/blame/639cd234d71ca81956b61ff7876f37c3cdc5c043/run-tests.py[he wrote], and he extracted the multi-engine comparison to: https://github.com/cirosantilli/commonmark-implementation-compare[CommonMark Implementation Compare].

    Playing with this project has led Ciro to find and report many Markdown bugs/bad behavior on other software, e.g. https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/297[GitHub] and https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-4/issues/68[MultiMarkdown-4].
  * https://github.com/isaacs/github[isaacs/github public unofficial GitHub issue tracker]: he has commented there so often that he https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/430#issuecomment-123851480[was made a collaborator]

The goal of this project is to reach \x[artificial-general-intelligence].

A few initiatives have created reasonable sets of robotics-like games for the purposes of AI development, most notably: \x[openai] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind[Google DeepMind].

However, all projects so far have only created sets of unrelated games, or worse: focused on closed games designed for humans!

What is really needed is to create a single cohesive game world, designed specifically for this purpose, and with a very large number of game mechanics.

Notably, by "game mechanic" is meant "a magic aspect of the game world, which cannot be explained by object's location and inertia alone". For example:
* when you press a button here, a door opens somewhere far away
* when you touch certain types of objects, a chemical reaction may happen, but not other types of objects

Much in the spirit of http://www.gvgai.net/[], we have to do the following loop:
* create an initial game
* find an AI that beats it well
* study the AI, and add a new mechanic that breaks the AI, but does not break a human!

The question then becomes: do we have enough computational power to simulation a game worlds that is analogous enough to the real world, so that our AI algorithms will also apply to the real world?

To reduce computation requirements, it is better to focus on a 2D world at first. Such world with the right mechanics can break any AI, while still being faster to simulate than a 3D world.

The initial prototype uses the Urho3D open source \x[game-engine], and that is a reasonable project, but a raw \x[simple-directmedia-layer] + Box2D + \x[opengl] solution from scratch would be faster to develop for this use case, since Urho3D has a lot of human-gaming features that are not needed, and because 2019 Urho3D lead developers https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/23c5bd936361f78a8dd6bd1f412286808714d2da/communities-that-censor-politics.md[disagree with the China censored keyword attack].

Simulations such as these can be viewed as a form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_data#Synthetic_data_in_machine_learning[synthetic data generation procedure], where the goal is to use computer worlds to reduce the costs of experiments and to improve reproducibility.

= Videos of all key physics experiments
{parent=the-most-important-projects-ciro-santilli-wants-to-do}

It is unbelievable that you can't find easily on YouTube recreations of many of the key \x[physics]/\x[chemistry] experiments and of common laboratory techniques.

Experiments, the techniques required to to them, and the history of how they were first achieved, are the heart of the natural sciences. Without them, there is no motivation, no beauty, no nothing.

\x[school]{c} gives too much emphasis on the formulas. This is bad. Much more important is to understand how the experiments are done in greater detail.

The videos must be completely reproducible, indicating the exact model of every experimental element used, and how the experiment is setup.

A bit like what \x[ciro-santilli] does in his \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions][Stack Overflow contributions] but with computers, by indicating precise versions of his operating system, software stack, and hardware whenever they may matter.

It is understandable that some experiments are just to complex and expensive to re-create. As an extreme example, say, a precise description of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider[LHC] anyone? But experiments up to the mid-20th century before "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Science[big science]"? We should have all of those nailed down.

We should strive to achieve the cheapest most reproducible setup possible with currently available materials: recreating the original historic setup is \x[art][cute], but not a priority.

Furthermore, it is also desirable to reproduce the original setups whenever possible in addition to having the most convenient modern setup.

Lists of good experiments to cover be found at: \x[the-most-important-physics-experiments].

This project is to a large extent a political endeavour.

Someone with enough access to labs has to step up and make a name for themselves through the huge effort of creating a baseline of amazing content without yet being famous.

Until it reaches a point that this person is actively sought to create new material for others, and things snowball out of control. Maybe, if the Gods allow it, that person could be Ciro.

Tutorials with a gazillion photos and short videos are also equally good or even better than videos, see for example Ciro's \x[oxford-nanopore-river-bacteria]{c} for an example that goes toward that level of perfection.

The \x[applied-science-youtube-channel] does well in that direction.

This project is one step that could be taken towards improving the \x[replication-crisis] of \x[science]. It's a bit what \x[hackster-io] wants to do really. But that website is useless, just write \x[cirodown] and create videos instead :-)

We're maintaining a list of experiments for which we could not find decent videosat: \x[physics-experiment-without-a-decent-modern-video]{full}.

= Website front-end for a mathematical formal proof system
{parent=the-most-important-projects-ciro-santilli-wants-to-do}

When \x[ciro-santilli] first learnt the old \x[zermelo-fraenkel-set-theory] and the idea of \x[formal-proof]{p}, his teenager \x[mind-blown][mind was completely blown].

Finally, there it was: a proper and precise definition of \x[mathematics], including https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers[a definition of integers], reals and limits!

Theorems are strings, proofs are string manipulations, and axioms are the initial strings that you can use.

Once proved, press a button on your computer, and the proof is automatically verified. No messy complicated "group of savants" reading it for 4 years and looking for flaws!

There are a few \x[proof-assistant] systems with several theorems in their \x[git] tracked standard library. The hottest ones circa 2020 are:
* https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL[]
* https://github.com/seL4/isabelle[]. Rumours have it that this is "uncompilable" from source without \x[evil][blobs]. It does however offer a very rich \x[ide].
* https://github.com/coq/coq[]
* \x[metamath] this one is likely an older and less powerful system, but the web presentation and tutorial are very good! Source: https://github.com/metamath/metamath-exe Here is a proof that 2 + 2 equals 4: http://us.metamath.org/mpeuni/2p2e4.html
* \x[lean-proof-assistant]
* https://www.bookofproofs.org/branches/fpl-formal-proving-language/ from \x[bookofproofs]

And here are some more interesting links:
* https://github.com/awesomo4000/awesome-provable an awesome list of formal stuff
* https://devel.isa-afp.org/ Isabelle Archive of Formal Proofs. A curated list of Isabelle proofs, with minimal web UI. This is almost what we need, but without the manual curation, and with a better web UI.
* http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/ list of how many of the "arbitrarily" selected \x[the-hundred-greatest-theorems-by-paul-and-jack-abad-1999] had been proved in several formal systems, serving therefore as a \x[benchmark] of sorts

However, as expressed by the \x[qed-manifesto], is unbelievable that there isn't one awesome and dominating website, that hosts all those proofs, possibly an on the browser editor, and which all mathematicians in the world use as the one golden reference of mathematics to rule them all!

Just imagine the impact.

Standard library maintainers don't have to deal with the impossible question of what is "beautiful" or "useful" enough mathematics to deserve merged: users just push content to the online database, and star what they like!

We then just use \x[github]-like namespaces for each person's theorem, e.g. "cirosantilli/fundmaental-theorem-of-calculus" or "johndoe/fundmaental-theorem-of-calculus" so that each person owns their own preferred definition IDs, which others can reuse.

No more endless \x[bikeshedding] over what insane level of generality do your \x[mathematical-analysis][analysis] theorems need to be (\x[ciro-santilli] attended at talk about \x[lean-proof-assistant] where the speaker mentioned this was a problem)!

This would move things more out of the "pull request and Git tracked code" approach, into a more "database with entries" version of things.

Furthermore, it is just a matter of time until the "single standard library" approach starts to break down, as the git clone becomes impossibly large. At this point, people have to start publishing separate packages. And when this happens, you would need to retest every package that you add to your project. This is why a centralized database is just inevitable at some point, it just scales better.

Interested in a conjecture? No problem: just subscribe to its formal statement + all known equivalents, and get an email on your inbox when it gets proved!

Are you a garage mathematician and have managed to prove a hard theorem, but no "real" mathematician will read your proof because your unknown? \x[fuck]{c} that, just publish it on the system and let it get auto verified. Overnight fame awaits.

Notation incompatibility hell? A thing of the past, just automatically convert to your preferred representation.

Such a system would be the perfect companion to \x[ourbigbook-com]. Just like computer code offers the backbone of \x[linux-kernel-module-cheat] Linux kernel tutorials, a formal proof system website would be the backbone of mathematics tutorials! You know what, if \x[ourbigbook-com] becomes insanely successful, Ciro is going to add this to it later on.

Furthermore, it would not be too hard to achieve this system!

All we would need would be something analogous to a package registry like \x[pypi] or https://www.npmjs.com/[NodeJS' registry].

Then, each person can publish packages containing proofs.

Packages can rely on other packages that contain pre-requisites definition or theorem.

Packages are just regular git repos, with some metadata. One notable metadata would be a human readable description of the theorems the package provides.

The package registry would then in addition to most package registries have a \x[ci] \x[server] in it, that checks the correctness of all proofs, generates a web-page showing each theorem.

All proofs can be conditional: the package registry simply shows clearly what axiom set a theorem is based on.

This is a close as we can get to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_from_THE_BOOK[Erdős' book].

Maybe Ciro will just stuff this into \x[ourbigbook-com] once that takes over the world.

This project could be seen as a more automated/less moderated version of \x[proofwiki].

\Image[https://web.archive.org/web/20191008120152im_/https://www.karlrupp.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/42-years-processor-trend-625x396.png]
{title=42 years of \x[microprocessor] trend data by Karl Rupp.}
{description=Only transistor count increases, which also pushes core counts up. But what you gonna do when atomic limits are reached? The separation between two silicon atoms is https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/itc/ee/test2/pdf%20files/silicon%20basics.pdf[0.23nm] and 2019 technology https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_nanometer[is at 5nm] scale.}
{source=https://www.karlrupp.net/2018/02/42-years-of-microprocessor-trend-data/}

Such advances could one day lead to both \x[unconditional-basic-income][biological super-AGI and immortality].

\x[ciro-santilli] is especially excited about \x[dna]-related technologies, because DNA is the centerpiece of biology, and it is programmable.

First, during the 2000's, the cost of \x[dna-sequencing] fell to about 1000 USD per genome in the end of the 2010's: \x[image-cost-per-genome-vs-moore-s-law-from-2000-to-2019]{full}, largely due to \x[illumina]["Illumina's" technology].

The medical consequences of this revolution are still trickling down towards medical applications of 2019, inevitably, but somewhat slowly due to tight privacy control of medical records.

\Image[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Cost_per_Genome.png/1024px-Cost_per_Genome.png]
{title=Cost per genome vs Moore's law from 2000 to 2019.}

\x[ciro-santilli] predicts that when the 100 dollar mark is reached, \i[every] person of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World[First world] will have their genome sequenced, and then medical applications will be closer at hand than ever.

But even 100 dollars is not enough. Sequencing power is like computing power: humankind can \i[never] have enough. Sequencing is not a one per person thing. For example, as of 2019 tumors are already being sequenced to help understand and treat them, and scientists/doctors will sequence as many tumor cells as budget allows.

Then, in the 2010's, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing[CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing] started opening up the way to actually modifying the genome that we could now see through sequencing.

What's next?

Ciro believes that the next step in the revolution could be could be: \x[de-novo-dna-synthesis].

This technology could be the key to the one of the ultimate dream of biologists: cheap https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00213[programmable biology] with push-button \x[species-bootstrapping-from-dna][organism bootstrap]!

Just imagine this: at the comfort of your own garage, you take some \x[model-organism] of interest, maybe start humble with \x[escherichia-coli]. Then you modify its DNA to your liking, and upload it to a 3D printer sized machine on your workbench, which automatically synthesizes the DNA, and injects into a bootstrapped cell.

You then make experiments to check if the modified cell achieves your desired new properties, e.g. production of some protein, and if not reiterate, just like a \x[software-engineer].

Of course, even if we were able to do the bootstrap, the \x[debugging] process then becomes key, as visibility is the key limitation of \x[biology], maybe we need other cheap technologies to come in at that point.

This a place point we see the beauty of evolution the brightest: evolution does not require observability. But it also implies that if your changes to the organism make it less fit, then your mutation will also likely be lost. This has to be one of the considerations done when designing your organism.

Other cool topic include:
* \x[computational-biology]: simulations of cell \x[metabolism], \x[protein] and small molecule, including \x[computational-protein-folding] and \x[chemical-reaction]{p}. This is basically the simulation part of \x[omics].

  If we could only simulate those, we would basically "solve molecular biology". Just imagine, instead of experimenting for a hole year, the \x[2021-nobel-prizes-in-physiology-and-medicine] could have been won from a few hours on a \x[supercomputer] to determine which protein had the desired properties, using just \x[dna-sequencing] as a starting point!
* \x[microscopy]: crystallography, \x[cryoem]
* analytical chemistry: mass spectroscopy, \x[single-cell-analysis] (Single-cell RNA sequencing)

It's weird, cells feel a lot like \x[linux-kernel-module-cheat][embedded systems]: small, complex, hard to observe, and profound.

Ciro is sad that by the time he dies, humanity won't have understood the \x[human-brain], maybe not even a measly \x[escherichia-coli]... Heck, even key molecular biology events are not yet fully understood, see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_(biology)[transcription regulation].

One of the most exciting aspects of \x[molecular-biology-technologies] is their relatively low entry cost, compared for example to other areas such as \x[fusion-energy] and \x[quantum-computing].

= Quantum computing could be the next big thing
{parent=the-next-big-thing}

As of 2020, \x[ciro-santilli] is getting excited about \x[quantum-computing], which is a \x[deep-tech] field.

He's a bit lazy to explain why here, but Googling will be more than enough.

There is a risk it will fizzle and the bubble pop, like any revolution.

But recent developments are making it too exciting to ignore.

= Brain-computer interfaces could be the next big thing
{parent=the-next-big-thing}

Main article: \x[brain-computer-interface]{parent}.

This is one of the \x[deep-tech] bets that \x[ciro-santilli] would put his money in as of 2020.

How hard could it be? You just have to learn the encoding of the neural spine/eyes/ear, add an invasive device that multiplexes it, and then \x[the-matrix-1999][the benefits could be mind blowing].

\x[neuralink][Musk approves].

Interestingly and obviously, the initial advances in the area are happening for people that have hearing or vision difficulties. Since they already have a deficient sense, you don't lose that much by a failed attempt.

Hearing is likely to be the first since it feels the simplest. Ciro heard there are even already clinical applications there. TODO source.

= Fusion power could be the next big thing
{parent=the-next-big-thing}

Main section: \x[fusion-power].

This is a long haul. But we have to give it a shot.

= How to contact Ciro Santilli
{synonym}

\x[ciro-santilli] is very happy to meet people with related interests, he really loves his like-minded online friends. Even if you don't have something a specific goal in mind for the contact, please just say hi.

To contact Ciro publicly about any general subject that is not covered in a more specific \x[github] repository, including saying hi or suggestions about his website either:
* create a \x[github] issue at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/issues/new
* at mention \x[ciro-santilli-s-twitter-accounts][Ciro's main Twitter account]

For \x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china][comments about China], first read:
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/faq
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
and then create a \x[github] issue at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/new

Publicly viewable contact is preferred if possible to more effectively share \x[cirism][Ciro's wisdom with the world].

But if you feel more comfortable with private contact, no problem, either:
* extract Ciro's \x[email] from one of his GitHub repositories. It might be of the form lower case first name, followed by a dot (which \x[google] actually ignores), followed by his lower case last name, and under a popular email domain from \x[google]
* use \x[telegram-software]: https://telegram.me/cirosantilli for the \x[end-to-end-encryption]. Secret chats only with a 1 week self-destruct timer.

  Please treat this as \x[email], Ciro might not reply immediately, but he will reply. So write longer complete messages each time.

  Ciro is trying to move more and more to \x[end-to-end-encrypted] methods as a basic \x[computer-security] hygiene exercise.

  Telegram is the best such mechanism that Ciro could find for now that \x[messaging-software-that-force-you-to-share-your-mobile-phone-with-contacts][does not require sharing cell phone numbers with all contacts].

  The closed sourcedness of the \x[server] is however a major point of concern. \x[signal-software] would be a better choice, but it does not have usernames and so requires users to share cell phone numbers.

  Another major pain point of Telegram is the lack of message sync across devices, which Signal also already solves.
* use \x[linkedin] or any other public profile linked to from: \x[accounts]

If you are a \x[internet-privacy][privacy] freak or are going to tell Ciro \x[government][state] secrets Ciro has:
* this \x[gnu-privacy-guard] public key: \a[pubkey.gpg]
* a \x[protonmail] account which is of form: "Ciro's GitHub username + protonmail.com". Ciro aims to maintain very high \x[operations-security] standards on that account, making it the most secure way to contact Ciro, and the only one with a reasonable chance of \x[plausible-deniability] :
  * \x[multi-factor-authentication]
  * unique password not-reused anywhere else, and not saved on any computer or disk (and therefore entered manually on every new session)
  * immediate deletion of received messages after reading. This is further strengthened by \x[ciro-santilli-s-bad-old-event-memory]
  * one week https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/expiration/[message expiration] on every message sent
  * only opened from trusted devices and when in a private location
  * only accessed through \x[tor-browser]
  * concession: notifications that messages were received in the ProtonMail mailbox are sent an unencrypted mailbox which Ciro views more regularly and which has more free storage. But the message content itself is not. It does not seem that the \x[android] app has a mode where it only notifies you of new messages but requires a password every time to see any messages. Also Android appears to request to remember passwords every time, so you risk clicking yes at some point.

If you have Ciro's phone number (available to closer acquaintances), Ciro's preferred \x[messaging-software] is \x[signal-software]. But he basically also runs all other major apps as well. Ciro sets a 1 week disappearing messages timer to all conversations. This is slightly less secure than protonmail as Ciro does not use \x[multi-factor-authentication] to open the messages every time, but it should be pretty damn good already.

\x[disqus] comments were removed from his website in 2019-05-04, a manual dump is \a[disqus-archive/][available here]{check=0}, removal rationale at: \x[why-ciro-santilli-removed-disqus-comments-from-his-website-in-2019-05-04].

Welcome to the wonderful world of Cirism!

Followers of Cirism call themselves \x[cirist]{p}.

Cirism is totally not a \x[cult], has been https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship/flg-religion[officially verified to be compatible with all major world religions].

The most enlightned Cirists can donate money to the cause at: \x[sponsor]{full}.

{title2=UBI}
{wiki}

= Unconditional basic income
{synonym}
{title2}

Unconditional basic income is \x[ciro-santilli]'s ultimate non-\x[transhumanist] technological dream: to reach a state of technological advancement and distribution of resources so high that everyone gets money for doing nothing, enough for:
* basic survival needs: food, housing, clothes, hygiene, etc.
* two children to keep the world going. Or immortality tech, but is harder and borderline transhumanist :-)
* high speed computer and Internet

Once a person has that, they can \x[ourbigbook-com]["learn, teach"] and create whatever they want. Or play \x[video-game]{p} all day long if they wish.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_pilots[Ciro santilli will not live to see this], and is content with helping it happen faster by increasing the efficiency of the world as. And having at least two well educated kids to carry on the project after he dies :-)

Technologies which would help a lot towards unconditional basic income, and might be strictly required required are:
* \x[artificial-general-intelligence]
* affordable https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot[humanoid robots] with human-like energy efficiency and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio[power-to-weight ratio].

  This is even less likely than AGI due to the \x[moore-s-law][end of silicon Moore's Law] and at the start of the Genome's Moore's law: information doubles, small sizes halve, but macroscopic mechanical artifacts stay the same.

  \x[brain-computer-interface]{p} are pretty certain to happen however after \x[ciro-santilli] dies.

So in the worst case we can just grow brainless bodies and replace the cavity hole with a computer that controls the body, possibly with high level decisions coming from a remote building-sized genetically engineered biological AGI brain.

Of course, it is all about costs. A human costs about http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1808049,00.html[130k 2010 USD/year]. So how cheap can we make the AGI / robot human equivalent / year for a given task?

AGI + humanoid robots likely implies https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover[AI takeover] though. It would then come down to human loving bots vs human hating bots fighting it out. It will be both terrifying and fun to watch.

AGI alone would be very dangerous, in case it can get control of our nuclear arsenals through software zero days or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29[social engineering]. Although some https://www.quora.com/Could-a-group-of-hackers-break-into-military-networks-and-launch-or-detonate-nuclear-missiles[claim that is unlikely].

Humanity's best bet to achieve silicon AGI today is to work on: \x[large-cohesive-game-world-for-robotic-like-artificial-intelligence-development].

{title=Even the Bible writers already know that multiple languages suck as seen from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel[Tower of Babel] parable.}

The fact that in poor countries a huge number of people do not speak the economically dominating language of the world, the \x[lingua-franca], \x[english-language] as of 2020, is a major obstacle to the development of those countries.

Despite us being in the information age, the people in those countries cannot fully benefit from it at all!

Teaching its people English should be the number one priority of any country. Without that, there can be no technological development. Everything else is secondary and can be learnt off the Internet once you know English.

And the most efficient way to do that, is that every country should create amazing free open source \x[english-language] learning material for their own language.

Also consider the \x[european] countries.

What big \x[company]{p} have been created in \x[europe] in the past 50 years, that have not been bought out by \x[american] or \x[japanese] companies? \x[solexa] (600M USD in 2007)? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSR_(company)[CSR] (2.5B USD in 2015)? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_Holdings[Arm Holdings] (32B USD in 2016)? So much so that https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliviergarret/2020/07/02/the-next-netflix-has-finally-revealed-itself/#5ceae87832db[much fanfare was made] as Spotify reached a 50B market capitalization in 2020. An \x[art] company, so cute!

The key problem is that there are so many small countries in \x[europe], that any \x[startup] has to deal with too many incompatible legislation and cannot easily sell to the hole of \x[europe] and scale.

So then a larger company from a more uniform country comes and \x[eats] it up!

So why can't \x[europe] unify its laws?

Because the countries are still essentially walled off by languages.

There isn't true mobility of people between countries.

You just can't go study or work in any other country (except for the UK, when it was still in the EU) without putting a huge effort into learning its language first.

Without this, there isn't enough mixing to truly make cultures more uniform, and therefore allow the laws to be more uniform.

Europe can't even unify basic things like:
* a marriage registry
* the mail system, parcels often getting lost and require you to contact people who may not speak English
* the train systems: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hinrich-thoelken_cop26-activity-6863490595072045057-Xhlg/
  \Q[This year, I decided to travel from Berlin to #COP26 in Glasgow by train. The journey was expected to cover 4 trains from 4 different railway operators and to last 17 hours. I had planned for at least 30 minutes transfer time in Cologne, Brussels and London.

  Well, as you might have guessed, in reality the trip took 32 hours and I spent one extra night at a hotel in London.]

Equally so, it can't force little fiscal paradises who effectively benefit from being in \x[europe] like Ireland, Luxembourg, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l37Ng61gJc[Monaco], Switzerland ("not European", but should that be allowed?) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus[Cyprus] (the EU can't even maintain its territorial integrity, let alone fiscal) to not offer ridiculously low taxes and incentives which make them entry points for foreign companies to rape Europe.

For this reason, Europe will only continue to go downhill with the years, and the \x[united-kingdom] will continue to try and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion[endosymbiose] into a state of the \x[united-states] (although https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/tree/1d69f2605e7c2602867344a70c6eed838b930105#the-west-must-ban-the-import-telecommunications-devices-from-china[at times it seems that it would rather endosymbiose with China instead]).

Historically, this disunion is partly due to the \x[european-balance-of-power], whereby countries would form alliances with old enemies to prevent another country from taking over. Also linked are failed military unification attempts by \x[napoleon] and \x[hitler], though we are likely better off without the latter succeeding!!! Though those also partly failed due to wider balance of power issues involving the \x[united-kingdom], the \x[soviet-union] and \x[usa], not only due to internal balance. Of course, none of that matters anymore after \x[world-war-ii], where other more unified \x[europe]-sized potencies rose, first the \x[usa] and the \x[soviet-union], and then \x[china], and now European disunion is nothing but a burden.

One thing must be said in favour of Europe's mess however: it favours international collaboration in huge projects as a more neutral middle ground. This can be seen more clearly in the \x[iter] and the fiasco that was the \x[superconducting-super-collider] that was cancelled a couple of billion dollars in partly because it failed to attract any foreign investment, compared to the \x[large-hadron-collider] which went on to find the \x[higgs-boson] as mentioned at https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-supercollider-that-never-was/[].

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis] is \x[bullshit] outside of poetry, and the ending of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrival_(film)[Arrival (2016)] makes one want to puke, where learning a language changes not only your brain, but also Ciro's precious \x[physics]["laws" of Physics]!

Much more likely are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Serve_Man_(The_Twilight_Zone)[To Serve Man]/\x[a-small-talent-for-war] events which we have already seen countless times!

Remember that those ideas come from a person who \x[ciro-santilli-s-natural-languages-skills][speaks 3.5 languages in 2019], and see absolutely no practical difference between them.

Of course, like all https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language[non-constructed languages], English is not fully optimal in terms of regularity and information density. It could be argued that other languages are better in those aspects.

For example, Ciro does believe that spoken Chinese is a better language than English overall from a purely "ease of learning from scratch point of view" as mentioned at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/tree/6fdeb5aa3826c69f7c058de4e6f652a6924bc08a#does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese[]. https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/tree/c0c41e7c55a7641fd00aad06beefa824e6f5b9c8#does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese[Chinese writing is completely insane of course], completely out of the question.

However, Ciro just doesn't think that the difference is that great to justify replacing English which is already dominant. How much more efficient can a perfect constructed language be than English? 1.01? 1.001? Such margins don't matter. Once you have learnt it young, it's done, for good.

English-based https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language#A_posteriori_language[a posteriori constructed languages] that regularize English further are perhaps the only reasonable alternative, like how \x[c-plus-plus] evolved from \x[c-programming-language] by creating a low cost upgrade path. Although in practice they will never take off unless a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters[dictatorship rules the world]:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_in_the_United_Kingdom_with_counterintuitive_pronunciations 
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globish_(Gogate)

One interesting anecdote is that Ciro met his \x[ciro-santilli-s-wife][wife] in French, and talking to her primarily in English feels really weird, so language does matter in love.

Different languages might also good at producing interesting diverse touristic locations, with different diverse and interesting foods. Because that's what tourism is all about. The exotic. The unique. And therefore, also necessarily the inefficient.

* \x[charles-kay-ogden], creator of \x[basic-english], according to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English[Basic English Wikipedia page]:
  \Q[Ogden's Basic, and the concept of a simplified English, gained its greatest publicity just after the Allied victory in World War II as a means for world peace. Ogden was convinced that the world needed to gradually eradicate minority languages and use as much as possible only one, English in either a simple or complete form.]

\Q[If you want to do something, but you are afraid to do it, then that is likely what you should do.]
{id=quote-afraid-to-do}

https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/11/08/not-bend/
\Q[Don't bend; don't water it down; don't try to make it logical; don't edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly.]

https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/50458-whatever-you-re-meant-to-do-do-it-now-the-conditions
\Q[Whatever you're meant to do, do it now. The conditions are always impossible.]

For example, when \x[ciro-santilli] was deciding what to do in university, he wanted mostly to do pure \x[physics].

But because he was afraid he was going to die poor and unemployed because of that, he picked engineering instead.

That was a mistake.

His family was not even poor. He was young and did not have a family to support. His father even told him: "do whatever the \x[fuck] you want, we support your decision".

But he was a coward.

It was also in part because a \x[physicist] uncle which he respected suggested that as an engineer Ciro might be able to make useful contributions to tooling required by physics. When https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Salmeron[Roberto Salmeron] died in 2020, Ciro's friends shared https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtqDLN3qT2w[this 2013 video interview] with the late professor, where he explains he first went to the \x[university-of-sao-paulo] to study engineering (like Ciro), but then fell for his passion for physics (like Ciro?), his first task being to build a \x[geiger-counter], thus explaining the likely origin of the uncle's theory. But who knows, maybe he was right. Maybe Ciro's \x[ourbigbook-com] will become huge and help a lot of people, and it might not have had Ciro not done engineering and learnt programming. Destiny operates in weird ways sometimes.

Furthermore, while in University, Ciro learnt about the \x[molecular-sciences-course-of-the-university-of-sao-paulo], a fantastic sounding full time course that any student could transfer to called that teaches various \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][natural sciences topics which Ciro loves (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology)] and which students from the entire university can apply to transfer to only after joining the university, with the guarantee that they can go back to their original courses if they didn't adapt to the new course.

But did Ciro do it? Nope, he remained an even larger coward.

Had he studied more sciences, he might have been happier, and might have had greater achievements later in life, in particular when he went to \x[ecole-polytechnique].

Maybe not, but now this doubt will never leave his mind until the final day.

Similar thoughts crossed his mind when he started his \x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china][campaign for freedom of speech in China], but this time he had learnt the lesson, and went for it, and it felt very good.

If you have a day job, but also have a dream, and want to keep the day job for a reason, try to reserve the time of the day that your brain works best before or after work for your dream.

Work a little less well for you boss, and a little better for yourself. \x[ross-ulbricht]:
\Q[I hated working for someone else and trading my time for money with no investment in myself]
Selling \x[drug]{p} online is not advisable however.

Even better, try to reach an official agreement with your employer to work 20% less than the standard work week. For example, you could work one day less every week, and do whatever you want on that day. It is not possible to push your passion to weekends, because your brain is too tired. "You keep all non-company-related IP you develop on that time" is a key clause obviously.

On a related note, good employers must allow employees to do whichever the \x[fuck] "crazy projects", "needed refactorings or other efficiency gains" and "learn things deeply" at least 20% of their time if employees want that: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20%25_Project[]. Employees must choose if they want to do it one day a week or two hours per day. One day per month initiatives are \x[bullshit]. Another related name: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_hour[genius hour].

Highly relevant on this topic: \x[video-what-predicts-academic-ability-by-jordan-b-peterson-2017].

Pursuing a dream part time can make you feel afraid and tired. But at least, you will feel alive. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQlAfI91cZ8[I did it for me, Skyler].

Maybe you will be fired, but long term, having tried, or even succeeded your dream, or a \x[the-side-effects-of-ambitious-goals-are-often-the-most-valuable-thing-achieved][one of its side effects], will be infinitely more satisfying.

The same goes for \x[school], and maybe even more so because your parents can still support you there. Some \x[god]{p} who actually followed this advice and didn't end up living under a bridge:
* \x[george-m-church] "\[We\] hope that whatever problems... contributed to your lack of success... at Duke will not keep you from a successful pursuit of a productive career." Lol, as of 2019 the dude is the most famous biotechnologist in the world, those "problems" certainly didn't keep him back.
* \x[freeman-dyson] proved the equivalence of the three existing versions of \x[quantum-electrodynamics] theories that were around at his time, and he has always been proud of not having a PhD!

  {title=\x[freeman-dyson] - Why I don't like the PhD system (95/157) by \x[web-of-stories] (2016)}
* Person that Ciro met personally and shall remain anonymous for now for his privacy: once Ciro was at a bar with work colleagues casually, it was cramped, and an older dude sat next to his group.

  The dude then started a conversation with Ciro, and soon he explained that he was a mathematician and software engineer.

  As a Mathematician, he had contributed to the \x[classification-of-finite-simple-groups], and had a short Wiki page because of that.

  He never did a PhD, and said that \x[academia] was a waste of time, and that you can get as much done by working part time a decent job and doing your research part time, since you skip all the \x[bullshit] of academia like this.

  Yet, he was still invited by collaborating professors to give classes on his research subject in one of the most prestigious universities in the world. Students would call him Doctor X., and he would correct them: Mister X.

  As a software engineer, he had done a lot of hardcore assembly level optimizations for x86 for some mathematical libraries related to his mathematics interests. He started talking microarchitecture with Ciro's colleagues.

  And he currently worked on an awesome open source project backed by a \x[company].

  At last but not least, he said he also fathered 17 children by donating his sperm to \x[lesbian] mothers found on a local \x[gay] magazine, and that he had met most/all of those children after they were born.

  A God. Possibly the most remarkable person Ciro ever met, and his jaw was truly dropped.

Companies can help you grow because you see real problems from within them, but their end goal is to consume you as much as possible. Don't let that happen. Invest part of what you gain, in yourself.

\Q[When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it... Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.]

{title=What Would You Do If Money Were No Object by \x[alan-watts].}
{description=Sample transcription: https://genius.com/Alan-watts-what-if-money-was-no-object-annotated[]:
\Q[
What do you desire? What makes you itch? What sort of a situation would you like?

Let's suppose, I do this often in vocational guidance of students, they come to me and say, well, "we're getting out of college and we have the faintest idea what we want to do". So I always ask the question, "what would you like to do if money were no object? How would you really enjoy spending your life?"

Well, it's so amazing as a result of our kind of educational system, crowds of students say well, we'd like to be painters, we'd like to be poets, we'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows you can't earn any money that way. Or another person says well, I'd like to live an out-of-doors life and ride horses. I said you want to teach in a riding school?

Let's go through with it. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something, which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him, you do that and forget the money, because, if you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time. You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don't like doing, which is stupid. Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way.

And after all, if you do really like what you're doing, it doesn't matter what it is, you can eventually turn it - you could eventually become a master of it. It's the only way to become a master of something, to be really with it. And then you'll be able to get a good fee for whatever it is. So don't worry too much. That's everybody is - somebody is interested in everything, anything you can be interested in, you will find others will.

But it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like, in order to go on spending things you don't like, doing things you don't like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See what we are doing, is we're bringing up children and educating to live the same sort of lifes we are living. In order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up their children to do the same thing, so it's all retch and no vomit. It never gets there. And so, therefore, it's so important to consider this question: What do I desire?

{parent=don-t-be-a-pussy}

\x[ciro-santilli] believes that there is a close link between the ability to create disruptive technology, and the desire to find bugs/exploits in systems.

Both of them destabilize society and enterprises.

Some examples:
* \x[jobs-and-wozniak-s-blue-box]{child}
* \x[robert-noyce]'s stealing a pig for a university party somewhat as a joke. This was actually a felony, but he got away with a compromise by paying the owner and being suspended for 6 months. The law is not blind, and thanks for that sometimes.

  Oh, and apparently he also got a university girlfriend pregnant, and she had an abortion.

And yes, this sometimes leads into a fine line between \x[legality] and illegality:

Ciro feels that this resonates a lot with his \x[ourbigbook-com].

Supercut:
\Q[
The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.

Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.

If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.

Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backward 10 years later.

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

Then:
\Q[
You've got to find what you love.

And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.

And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.

Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.

And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

So keep looking until you find it.

Don't settle.
]

And:
\Q[
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."

It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"

And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

{description=TODO understand the context of the question a bit better. It is something to do with an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc[OpenDoc] thing and \x[java].}

Decide your goal first, and then do whatever is needed to how to reach it.

Don't start randomly learning tech, because that means you \x[how-to-teach/help-students-achieve-their-goal][will waste a lot of time learning useless stuff].

There is of course some level chicken-and-egg paradox in this, as \x[image-dilbert-nuclear-power-user-requirements][highlighted by Dilbert], since choosing an achievable goal in the first place requires some level of technical understanding.

\Image[https://web.archive.org/web/20200331090146im_/https://assets.amuniversal.com/1af002106d5c01301d80001dd8b71c47]

{id=image-dilbert-nuclear-power-user-requirements}
{source=https://dilbert.com/strip/2002-02-20}

However, it is much more common that people will get way too involved in learning useless stuff and lose sight of the \x[art][useful end goals].

Rather, take an iterative approach:
* start with an ambitious end goal
* learn a bit of tech to try and reach it
* realize that you can't reach your end goal and pivot a bit to a related end goal that seems more realistic: \x[the-side-effects-of-ambitious-goals-are-often-the-most-valuable-thing-achieved]
* loop

There is some truth to the counter argument that "but if you don't spend a lot of time learning the basics, you can never find solutions".

However, these people underestimate your \x[brain]. The brain is beautiful, and human intuition is capable of generating interest towards the things that are actually useful to reach your goal. When you feel like learning something related to your goal, by all means, give yourself the time to do so. But this still be \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][much more efficient than just learning random things that other people tell you to learn].

= How to become a good programmer?
{parent=backward-design}

Or: how to learn X.

This pops up on \x[reddit] every week.

That is \x[backward-design][the wrong question].

The right question is: what is the most awesome project I can do to improve the world?

Then, once you decide to try one, if that involves \x[programming], only then learn to program to achieve that goal. And don't stop learning what's needed until you either get the thing done, or decide that it is actually not a good idea, or not possible, or that there is something else more important to be done first.

But if doesn't involve programming, then don't learn to program, and \x[backward-design][learn whatever you actually need to reach that goal instead].

Having that goal is the only way to be motivated to do something.

This is the essence of \x[backward-design].

Another very important point to keep in mind is: \x[when-in-doubt-choose-the-course-that-has-the-most-experimental-work]{full}.

= Free gifted education
{parent=cirism}

This term was invented by \x[ciro-santilli], and similar ideas certainly already exists with different names by other people. As the name suggests, it basically involves combining \x[free-education]  and \x[gifted-education], but with other more specific aspects crammed in that would make a precise name too long to read, as descried below.

\x[government]{c} must create selective, \x[k-12] and \x[university]-level teaching institutions that are completely free.

As mentioned at \x[what-poor-countries-have-to-do-to-get-richer/pick-few-good-bets], these do not need to be given to all students: what we have to do is to ensure that the top N-percent of the best students will get in, and that none of them will pay. Where N is as large as the budget society decides to put into this project, the larger the better. Therefore, perhaps "gifted education" is not the ideal name for this idea, as it generally implies very small N (1%?), while this project hopes for larger N, maybe 10%. But a minimal level of quality must be attained, it is pointless to dissolve the resources too much, if we only have enough for 1%, then so be it, start with 1%.

Since all the learning resources will be available online on \x[ourbigbook-com], or through online 1-to-1 chats with mentors, it might be cheaper for students to work from their parent's homes if their home has reasonable work conditions (a silent room with reasonable \x[internet] access and no \x[drug-addict]{p} in the house). Then the state only needs to pay transportation and temporary accommodation to attend concentrated month-long \x[laboratory] courses and week-long conferences. In cases where the home conditions are not good enough, the state can either pay for on-demand WeWork-like offices near the student's home, of for a full on-campus accommodation as in a \x[boarding-school]. What is indispensable is that all students who pass the entry criteria must have such working conditions. Students who stay home can also earn a scholarship to help pay for their rent, food and Internet access.

These institutions must start from the very first school year, and go all the way up through \x[k-12] to the end of university. It is useless to start at university-level only otherwise only the rich students will have a chance of getting in, like \x[ciro-santilli] saw in \x[brazil] at the \x[polytechnic-school-of-the-university-of-sao-paulo] in the late 2000's: one day all students were gathered in the amphitheater, and they asked the students who had only gone through free government \x[k-12] schools to raise their hands. Those were notably worse than the corresponding private schools, and the situation is inverted in \x[university], where the best schools are the government ones. Out of about 500 people, at most 10 raised their hands!

These institutions should not have \x[affirmative-action] entry quotas, including most importantly at the \x[university-entry-quotas][university level]. Both rich and poor should be able to apply. Passing the selection criteria is all that matters. We just must ensure that the schools are widely advertised amongst disadvantaged communities, so that they will at least get their children to try to apply from an early age. This way, even if the rich always have an advantage due to better overall conditions, the poor are so much more numerous that the majority of students accepted will still be poor.

The school should follow the basic principles of \x[how-to-teach], notably:
* \x[students-must-have-a-flexible-choice-of-what-to-learn]. There will be no classes, all learning will happen either \x[ourbigbook-com] or on 1-to-1 meeting with tutors, or in discussions with fellow students.

  The term "gifted education" might suggest elitism, but \x[ciro-santilli] strongly believes that different people have different skills, and that if everyone could focus on whatever it is that they want to do in life, be it \x[engineering] or the \x[art]{p}, rather than just pass a bunch of useless \x[exam], then having the 10% "best" of each interest group would already cover a huge percentage of the population.
* \x[backward-design].

  Through it, students will be helped to directly achieve their greater life goals.

  There will be no teachers: each student will be assigned senior advisors, and together they will come with an individualized research proposal or business plan.

  There will be no useless mandatory institutional \x[exam]{p}. Exams only need to be taken if a given advisor requires it to filter candidate students. But if you manage to impress them through other means, they can just accept you without the exam.

  A fundamental part of this is to fill the \x[the-missing-link-between-basic-and-advanced]. We want to help students to reach the \x[state-of-the-art] of their field of interest as fast as possile.
* \x[how-to-teach/group-students-by-interest-not-by-age]

These schools must pay mentors as much as the average good non-free schools so you actually get comparably good teachers. Mentor selection would also be highly competitive, just as that of the students.

Once admitted, students will have guaranteed access to the school resources for a few years. This way, they won't need to worry about passing useless exams every three months.

All that matters is that they are progressing in their development plan. Rather than exams, students will do regular progress report sessions with their advisors, and will get periodic reviews from other advisors with similar interests.

Such projects could be funded by much needed \x[wealth-tax] or other measures to \x[tax-the-rich], which the people should claim through \x[referendum]{c}, that would be come more common with the adoption of \x[electronic-voting]. Because the politicians are simply not being able to do it.

= The side effects of ambitious goals are often the most valuable thing achieved
{parent=cirism}

A quote by \x[university-of-sao-paulo][Ciro's Teacher R.]:
\Q[Sometimes, even if our end goals are too far from reality, the side effects of trying to reach them can have meaningful impact.]

If the goals are not ambitious enough, you risk not even having useful side effects so show in the end!

By doing the prerequisites of the impossible goal you desire, maybe the next generation will be able to achieve it.

This is basically why \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions][Ciro Santilli has contributed to Stack Overflow], which has happened while was doing his overly ambitious projects and notice that all kinds of basic pre-requisites were not well explained anywhere.

This is especially effective when you use \x[backward-design], because then you will go "down the dependency \x[graph] of prerequisites" and smoothen out any particularly inefficient points that you come across.

Going into such productive \x[procrastination] is also known informally as \x[yak-shaving].

There are of course countless examples of such events:

= Ciro Santilli's best random thoughts
{parent=cirism}
{c}

These are "original" thoughts that Ciro had which at some point in the past amused him. Some would call them pieces of wisdom, others self delusion. All have likely been thought by others in the past, and some of them Ciro thinks to himself after a few years: "why did I like this back then??".

After Ciro's colleague was doing that in a project:
\Q[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris_facts[Chuck Norris] can parse pseudocode.]

On the theory vs practice of computer science:
\Q[Whereas \x[turing-complete][Turing completeness] is enough for \x[mathematician]{p}, humans need "run-on-Debian-complete".]

On how human perception of media is completely unrelated to the computer's transmission mechanism:
\Q[Media for humans is not byte streams. It is magic.]

This is of course just another version of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_words[one picture is worth a thousand words].

Others:

= Animal rights
{parent=cirism}

\x[ciro-santilli] has mixed feelings about animal rights.

On one hand, his irrational side wants of course all animals to be happy.

On the other, he does not care about this enough to not kill and \x[eat] them, even though he believes that you could live off \x[plant]{p} relatively well.

His more rational side says: humans are sacred. Either because you believe in the \x[religion][soul], or because your \x[brain][built-in empathy behaviours]. If it is not a human, do whatever you want to it. Killing is already undoubtedly the greatest \x[sin]. It is not OK to kill a human painlessly is it? So if torturing it brings humans good, then do it.

Of course, this does get use close and closer to "the what is a human" question, which is more relevant than ever in the \x[molecular-biology-technologies][awakening of genetics]: all species are after all a continuum right?

And Ciro does not have a simple solution to this problem, besides that in 99.9999% the answer is obvious to 99.9999% of the people, and for the others cases, we have to do it like the law and make flawed rules to cover the remaining 0.000099999% cases and let juries decide the rest.

The only other sensible sacredness barrier is the common vegetarian "nervous systems are sacred" one. But how can you believe that if you also follow the religion of \x[physics], where \x[physics-and-the-illusion-of-life][everything is just made of atoms]?

Is it evil to take one neuron and torture it? What does that even mean? It will be fun when \x[brain][pain and pleasure] are fully understood.

And you are going to have a really hard time when https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa_in_Jainism[mosquitoes start transmitting deadly diseases that kill your family].

Laws in most 2020 Western modern societies have converged to a hypocritical balance between not offending people too much by hiding the killing and minimizing the pain when possible at low cost. Killing animals painlessly is basically always fine if it brings any "non sadistic" pleasure to humans. And torturing animals is fine with approval e.g. to make medicines.

This has the downside of increasing costs for society. Maybe there are practical benefits besides people feeling bad about animals? Maybe we would have more serial killers if people were free to torture animals? Maybe people in butcher shops would become depressive if their bosses weren't forced to use more expensive painless killing methods? Neither of those seems like huge arguments though.

It eventually comes down to: "how much more is a human life worth than that of an animal" which brings \x[jesus]'s https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-34&version=NIV[Matthew 6:25-34 "Do Not Worry"] (https://web.archive.org/web/20190801221835/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-34&version=NIV[archive]) quote to mind:
\Q[Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?]

Non-vegetarian pets owners also baffle Ciro, as most of them basically extend the sacred human line further arbitrarily to certain other cute looking animals like dogs, cats or rabbits, but will gladly kill a cow indirectly by paying someone to pay someone to pay someone to cut it into small pieces. Or they believe that certain specific individuals are sacred. Admittedly, the latter is more rational, and looks a lot of how we treat our own families well, and can accept that other families are not doing so well.

Ciro's even more rational evil side says: the real reason why humans are sacred is a practical one: people have families that love them, and they come to kill you if you kill them, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Romeo_and_Juliet#Prince_Escalus[this starts endless chains of violence] that make society unbearable.

While animals feel pain when their children are killed, their memory and logic is just not good enough to fully understand that humans in general have an evil plot to it, and they don't have a method to communicate between themselves and fight back.

For similar reasons, Ciro is pro-abortion.

\x[futurama]'s S02E15 \x[the-best-television-series]["The Problem With Popplers" episode] blew Ciro's mind so much.

Ciro should stop discussing topics in which infinite argument has already been had. Sometimes he writes things down so he can stop caring the next time the subject comes up, as there's no need to say it again once it is written.

= University entry quotas
{parent=cirism}

\x[ciro-santilli] is against \x[affirmative-action] university entry quotas that reserve spaces e.g. for students from discriminated races or poor families. Instead, he believes that affirmative action should take place on earlier stages of education as described at: \x[free-gifted-education].

Notably, \x[brazil] has implemented a very heavy university entry quota system \x[ciro-santilli-s-formal-education][after Ciro had left university there]: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23862676

This is of course easy for a white male from a privileged background to say, and infinite debate has already been had on this matter, but here goes again.

First, in defense to the personal attack, Ciro raises the fact that he has dedicated large chunks (all?) of his life to open source \x[open-source-software][software] and knowledge in general, which Ciro believes is the only way to actually make the world fairer to poor countries. His money (time) is where his mouth is.

One good argument in favor of the \x[brazilian] quota system, is that the kids who enter university because of quotas http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0100-15742009000200014[do just as well as those who don't].

Ciro has actually believes that this is possible, and offers the following possible explanation: \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][most of pre-university knowledge is useless, and university selection system is crap, and Ciro wants to destroy it with a system in which anyone can learn university stuff from home].

Both the top end of the quota and non-quota kids are basically equally capable of doing useful stuff therefore.

Only a tiny fraction of what you learn in high school is useful for university or your career.

And possibly more importantly than knowledge, Ciro saw many of his colleagues (basically all of which were from relatively privileged backgrounds) "do badly" in university, because of lack of motivation, because they had chosen a course only to find that they were not interested in it because the existing \x[how-to-teach/help-students-achieve-their-goal][high school educational system is crap and does not help them find what they love] and because it costs you \x[students-must-have-a-flexible-choice-of-what-to-learn][several years of your life to change your choice in most universities] (long live \x[ecole-polytechnique]).

Maybe the fact that poor kids know that they are \x[fucked] if they fail, and so they have to succeed at any cost, might also help with motivation. Which is a terrible terrible thing, because only those who have to leeway to take risks end up taking them and making the \x[the-next-big-thing].

Ciro believes instead that only once kids have learnt university level stuff in their area of interest \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][for free on the Internet] should they go through selection based on that specific and much more concentrated useful knowledge.

And this competition must only be used to distribute resources which you can't learn from \x[fucking] computers:
* laboratories. Actually, one of Ciro's most important advices to kids nowadays is: \x[when-in-doubt-choose-the-course-that-has-the-most-experimental-work]
* \x[how-to-teach/talk-with-individuals-not-to-groups][one to one mentorship] on advanced master thesis/PhD level projects

Once this point knowledge is reached however, it starts to become unclear if a single "everyone takes the same test to avoid discrimination" test is feasible anymore, and we start entering the much more relevant (and potentially discriminatory) "I am a teacher trying to advance the \x[state-of-the-art], and I need https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_having_ordinary_skill_in_the_art[a person mildly skilled in the art] to do some slave labor for me", which is PhDs selection work.

If quota are in place, what will happen is that parents of the rich kids will start investing less in education, and possibly just put their kids in high schools, and do home schooling instead. This would therefore reduce the total investments the country makes in education!

Outside of the obvious technical evolution proposed, Ciro is a huge proponent of \x[free-gifted-education].

Then let those kids pass exactly the same university entry exams, and watch them crush the average privileged kids.

This advice is similar to what is mentioned at: \x[what-poor-countries-have-to-do-to-get-richer]. When you don't have money to do everything, you must select a few good bets and focus on them. You can't pay a lot to every public school teacher, so you must select a few select places that need it the most. As those smart bets pay off, you start to have more and more money to expand the system further.

{title=Inside Westside Barbell by \x[vice-news] (2018)}
{description=One sentence of this nice documentary about the notorious Westside Barbell gym where the openly pro-performance-enhancing-drug powerlifting legend leader and \x[cult]-leader-like personality https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Simmons[Louis Simmons] teaches just stuck to \x[ciro-santilli]'s mind. His top tenant and manager Tom Barry talks about Louis:
\Q[The man \[Louis\] lives in his own world, and he just rejects everything outside of it, it doesn't matter. Like: "what's your name"? He doesn't care. If you lift numbers, he cares about that, that's more important.]
Ciro admires this level of focus, directness and \x[meritocracy]. Just don't take \x[drug]{p}, children. Louis' creation of a \x[cult]-like training atmosphere is another interesting aspect, see also: \x[how-to-teach/group-students-by-interest-not-by-age]{full}.

Ciro wonders if Louis is a white supremacist though, https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/comments/ofijva/the_im_a_powerlifter_starterpack/h4ep7of/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3[this was asked here] but is inconclusive.

= Students must have a flexible choice of what to learn
{parent=cirism}

This is one of the main reasons why \x[ciro-santilli] invested in \x[ourbigbook-com].

Ciro believes that the only thing students must be forced to learn \x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world][is to speak read and write English] and that \x[how-to-teach/help-students-achieve-their-goal][a teacher's main job after that is to help students find their next big goals] and also ties into the \x[backward-design][backward design philosophy].

Everything else, the student must choose.

This idea is generally known as \x[self-directed-learning].

This is most notable in \x[university-entry-quotas][University entry examinations of poor countries], where students often have to waste one extra year of their lives to go through preparation for the useless university entry exams. And then, surprise surprise, if they actually get in, they find that this is not what they really wanted to do, and they just go through to the end miserably because they understandably they don't want to risk another year of their lives.

Ciro saw this first hand \x[ecole-polytechnique] which was way freer than his \x[university-of-sao-paulo][university in Brazil].

\x[steve-jobs]'s university dropout stories from \x[steve-jobs-2005-stanford-commencement-address] also come to mind.

https://www.nature.com/articles/081121a0[]. \x[academic-publishing][paywalled] after more than 100 years, thanks \x[nature-journal].

From the abstract:
\Q[Much money, his student went on to say, is spent by various Governments in attempting to discover those people whose thorough education may be expected to bring in a return of value to the State, and the question how best to discover latent genius is an eminently practical one. After cogitation, Prof. Ostwald came to the conclusion that it is those students who cannot be kept on the rails - that is, who are not contented with methodical teaching - who have within them the seeds of genius]
\x[ciro-santilli] couldn't agree more... notably \x[students-must-have-a-flexible-choice-of-what-to-learn].

= Rooting for sport teams
{parent=cirism}

Since \x[ciro-santilli] is \x[brazilian], this is understandably a common conversation opener.

And rightly so, since \x[soccer] in particular is truly ridiculously popular in \x[brazil], where "what is your local soccer team?" is just as valid a conversation starter as "Which city are you from?".

So here goes Ciro's 2020 cynic answer:
\Q[I currently root actively against Brazil.]

The ironic reason is simple: maybe is Brazil loses more on this \x[art][useless art], then maybe people will get tired of it, and instead \x[physics][invest on more useful and beautiful arts].

Notably, what Ciro really wants people to root for are:
* the number of \x[brazilian] \x[nobel-prize]{p}, which is zero, yes, zero, as of 2020, despite a population of 210 million people. But thank \x[god] for our one https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artur_Avila[Field Medal], what an epic start, even though \x[art][Mathematics is useless].
* the number of high tech companies that have a global impact, which is likely extremely low as of 2020, and must contain only a few mammoths that dominate some local \x[commodity] market and therefore got enough money from that to expand a bit of technology worldwide. But they were mostly not classic tech \x[startup]{p} that did world innovation from the start.
* how low your country's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient[Gini coefficient is]

Don't get Ciro wrong.

\x[ciro-santilli-s-sport-practice][Playing sports yourself is amazing].

Observing professionals who do it amazingly can be beautiful.

But why the F do you have to root for a team unless your wife or children are playing in it (and even then..., how will that help?)?

What will you get from that?

Even if it is your national team, why does it matter if they win or lose?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_hooliganism[Hooliganism] just takes that uselessness to a hole new level.

Now some confessions.

A five year old Ciro will never forget when the feeling of Brazil won the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_FIFA_World_Cup[1994 World Cup] on the penalties and everyone went mad that evening.

A nine year old Ciro stopped watching the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_FIFA_World_Cup[1998 World Cup Final] of Brazil vs France half way during the 3-0 massacre and went to his front garden to kick his \x[soccer] ball on the metallic fence gate which represented a goal.

After that, Ciro went through puberty he guesses, and noticed that the \x[natural-science]{p} are just cooler than this soccer watching bullshit.

= There is value in tutorials written by beginners
{parent=cirism}
{wiki}

\x[ciro-santilli] is a big believer that there is value in tutorials written by beginners, because beginners are more likely to explain things in a way that other beginners can understand.

Even though they make more mistakes, this more approachable point of view can be very valuable.

And mistakes/omissions can be corrected on comments by people with more knowledge, so that the writer also ends up learning something new.

The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten. He sees the whole subject, by now, in a different light that he cannot conceive what is really troubling the pupil; he sees a dozen other difficulties which ought to be troubling him but aren't.]

Everyone is beginner when the field is new, and \x[there-is-value-in-tutorials-written-by-beginners].

Cirocoins are the most valuable form of currency that exists at any point.

Cirocoins can only be issued by \x[ciro-santilli].

Cirocoins are strictly nominal, and cannot be traded by recipients with anyone but Ciro, i.e. they are extremely \x[illiquid].

Cirocoins can be removed from recipients at any point if they commit non-Cirist acts.

It is not possible to give a precise number to how many Cirocoins anyone owns. This is decided on a transaction by transaction basis. Ciro can therefore only inform you if your Cirocoin balance increased or decreased, but any attached number has no value, and thus are equivalent to expressions of type "you gained/lost a Cirocoin".

{parent=ciro-santilli-s-website}

Commit: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io/commit/794705a201a79b5128934e69df85e3511655c03f

As Ciro started getting a lot of comments on his home page \x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china][about China], he decided that \x[disqus] does not scale, and that it would be more productive long term to remove it and point people to \x[github] issues instead.

Upsides of removal:
* Disqus discoverability is bad:
  * there is no decent way to search existing issues, you have to do \x[javascript] infinite loading + Ctrl + F. So every reply that he wrote is a waste of time, as it will never be seen again.
  * comments don't have: decent URLs, titles, metadata like tags or open / close
* Disqus archival is bad: http://web.archive.org/ does not work, and no one knows how to export the issues: https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Disqus
* before, there were two places where people could comment, Disqus and \x[github] issues. Now there is just one.
* Disqus has ads if you ever reach enough traffic, which unacceptable, especially if the website owner don't get paid for them! It also makes page loads slower, although that likely does not matter much.

Downsides:
* people are more likely to comment on Disqus than to create an issue on GitHub, especially because most people use GitHub professionally. But this has the upside that there will be less shitposts as well.
* with Disqus you can see all issues attached to a page automatically, which is nice. But for as long as Ciro is alive, he intends to just solve the issues, cross link between content and issues and tag things appropriately.

Ciro's stance towards China hasn't changed, and China comments and corrections about his website are still welcome as always.

Ciro only touches this very rarely, and always forgets and go into great pain whenever a change needs to done, so it is important to document it.

= Media rationale of Ciro Santilli's website
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-website}

= One page to rule them all
{parent=media-rationale-of-ciro-santilli-s-website}

It is true that one image is worth a thousand words, but unfortunately it is also true that one image takes up at least as much bytes as a thousand words!

Having one single page to rule them all is of course the \x[ideal] setup for a website, as you can Ctrl + F one ToC and quickly find what you want.

And, with \x[linux-kernel-module-cheat] Ciro noticed that it is very hard to write so much intelligent prose that becomes larger than reasonable to load on a single webpage.

He then started using this technique for everything he writes, including this page and \x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china][Chinese government].

However, if there are too many images on the page, the loading of the last images would take forever in case users want to view the last sections.

There are two solutions to that:
* be traditional and create separate web pages
* be bold and load images as they appear on the viewport: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2321907/how-do-you-make-images-load-only-when-they-are-in-the-viewport/57389607#57389607

  Edit: OK, it was standardized with `loading=lazy`, without need \x[javascript]!

  Now the last awesome thing would be a method that loads first images in viewport, then those below, and then those above, that would be the ultimate solution.

  This question comes close: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7906348/change-loading-order-of-images-already-on-page

Ciro is still deciding between those two. The traditional approach works for sure but loses the one page to rule them all benefits.

The innovative approach will work for interactive viewing, but archive.org will fail to load the images for example, and there may be other unforseen consequences.

Wikimedia Commons is awesome and automatically converts and serves smaller versions of images, so always choose the smallest images size needed by the output document. Readers can then find the higher resolution versions by following the page source.

This also comes to mind: https://motherfuckingwebsite.com

= Where to store images
{parent=media-rationale-of-ciro-santilli-s-website}
{id=media-rationale-of-ciro-santilli-s-website/where-to-store-images}

Since images are large, they bring the following challenges:
* keeping images in the main Git repository with text content makes the repository huge and slow to clone, and should not be done
* storing and serving images could cost us, which we want to avoid

To solve those problems, the following alternatives appear to be stable enough and should be used decreasing preference:
* for all images, use the separate GitHub repository: https://github.com/cirosantilli/media

  This way, the entire website is relies on a single third party: GitHub, so we have a simple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure[single point of failure].

  We are at the mercy of GitHub's 1GB size policy: https://help.github.com/en/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota[], but it will take a while to hit that.

  GitLab however has a 10Gb maximum size: https://about.gitlab.com/2015/04/08/gitlab-dot-com-storage-limit-raised-to-10gb-per-repo/ so we could move there is we ever blow up 1Gb on GitHub.

  Both GitLab and GitHub allow uploading files through the web UI, so downloading a large repo is never needed to contribute.

  GitHub does not serve videos like it does images however as of 2019.
* https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page[Wikimedia Commons] for videos if the following conditions are met:

  * https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Project_scope[in scope]: "educational material in a broad sense", but not e.g. "Private image collections, e.g. private party photos, photos of yourself and your friends, your collection of holiday snaps and so on.". I don't think they will be too picky even with low quality photos.
  * allowed format, e.g. images or videos, but not ZIPs
  * allowed license: CC BY SA, but no fair use

  Since Wikimedia Commons has a higher level of curation and is an educational not-for-profit, it is the method most likely to remain available for the longest time.

  For this reason, we highly recommend uploading any acceptable files there as well as an additional backup.

  The downside is that its tooling is not as good, e.g. https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/135251/how-to-download-all-files-from-an-uploader-on-wikimedia-commons[there are a bunch of messy unofficial tools for batch operations], and upload takes more effort.

  Another downside of Wikimedia Commons is that while we can choose the basename of files, it also adds some extra SHA crap to the beginning of URLs, making them harder to predict.

  Another serious downside is that they randomly rename images without redirects... e.g. they renamed https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/STJ_SVG_file.svg to https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Superconducting_tunnel_junction.svg

  Another "downside" is that they are extremely strict about copyright compliance. This is good because you can be pretty sure that they are correct in general, but it also means that they are very conservative, and delete things where fair use would be OK. And if those fair uses have no Wikipedia page, they won't show up anywhere.
* https://archive.org for anything else, e.g. videos that Wikimedia commons does not accept.

  All content will be tracked under the `cirosantilli` collection: https://archive.org/details/cirosantilli

  archive.org has a very convenient upload and lax requirements. The generated URLs are predictable (single SHA prefix for the entire collection).

  Never trust a website that is not on \x[github-pages], for-profit companies will take down everything immediately as soon as it stops making them money.

  Every external link to non-GitHub pages must be archived. And GitHub links must be forked.

  We should also backup images that Wikimedia Commons does not accept here in addition to the https://github.com/cirosantilli/media repository.

The following alternatives seem impossible because Ciro could not find if they expose direct links to the images:
* \x[google-photos] https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/92777/how-to-get-the-direct-link-to-an-image-in-my-google-photos
* Imgur https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/84535/has-imgur-stopped-giving-direct-links

The following do have direct links:
* https://www.flickr.com e.g. https://live.staticflickr.com/7437/27402357162_7d91b73cd5_z.jpg documented at https://help.flickr.com/en_us/get-the-url-of-a-flickr-photo-S1Hnnmjym Also does automatic image size conversion. But only provides ugly autogenerated URLs.
* \x[instagram] does not support upload from computer? Lol?

For videos, \x[youtube] does not allow download, even of Creative Commons videos so uploading only there is not acceptable as it prevents reuse:
* https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8033/is-it-legal-to-download-and-modify-videos-from-youtube-licensed-under-creative-c

Because when this gets converted to a \x[ourbigbook-com] page, it will be easier for people to copy paragraphs/fork and write a canonical page about Ciro.

What do you do when creating a pull request? Do you say "I", which is not true because Ciro did not say that, or do you say "John Doe thinks" bla bla?

And because \x[ciro-santilli-s-selfish-desires][his name is awesome]! :-) Just kidding.

= How to develop Ciro Santilli's website before the Cirodown migration
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-website}

The website moved from \x[asciidoctor] to \x[cirodown] in 2020, making this section mostly useless. But hey, history!

Ciro's website is powered by \x[github-pages] and https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[Jekyll Asciidoc].

The source code is located at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io

Build locally, watch for changes and rebuild automatically, and start a local server with:
``
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli.github.io
cd cirosantilli.github.io
bundle install
npm install
./run
``

Source: `./run`.

The website will be visible at: http://localhost:4000[].

Tested on the latest Ubuntu.

Publish changes to \x[github-pages]:
``
git add -u
git commit -m 'make yourself look sillier'
./publish
``

Source: `./publish`.

GitHub forces us to use the master branch for the build output... so the actual source is in the branch `dev`.

Update the gems with:
``
bundle update
git add Gemfile.lock
git commit -m 'update gems'
``

His website was originally written in \x[markdown], however those were deprecated in favour of \x[asciidoctor] when Ciro saw the light, rationale shown at: \a[markdown-style-guide#use-asciidoc]{check=0}

GitHub pages is chosen instead of a single page GitHub README.adoc for the following reasons:
* Ciro will want some unsupported extensions, notably mathematics, likely with \x[mathematics-typesetting-setup-of-ciro-santilli-s-website][KaTeX server side]:
  * https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/pull/3338
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11256433/how-to-show-math-equations-in-general-githubs-markdownnot-githubs-blog

  * https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-combine-latex-and-markdown-in-GitHub
* when GitHub dies, Ciro's website URL still lives and retains the \x[pagerank]!

= Ciro Santilli's documentation superpowers
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-skills}

\x[ciro-santilli] has the power to document stuff in a way that makes using them awesome, as evidenced by his his \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions][Stack Overflow contributions] (notably those in \x[articles]), and other online contributions.

If your project does something awesome, hiring Ciro means that more people will be able to notice that it is actually awesome, and use it.

He likes to do this in parallel to contributing new features, quickly switching between his "developer" and "technical documentor" hats.

This means of course that he will develop new features a bit slower than others, but he feel it is more valuable if end users can actually use your project in the first place.

His technique is to provide upfront extremely interactive and reproducible getting started setups that immediately show the key value of the project to users.

He backs those setups with:
* scripts that automate the setup much as possible to make things enjoyable and reproducible
* a detailed description of the environment in which he tested: which OS, version of key software, etc.
* a detailed description of what is expected to happen when you take an action, including known bugs with links to bug reports
* theory and rationale on the sections after the initial getting started, but always finely interspersed with concrete examples
* all docs contained in a Git-tracked repo, with the ability to render to a single HTML with one TOC
* short sentences and paragraphs, interspersed with many headers, lists and code blocks
A prime example of kind of setup is Ciro's \x[linux-kernel-module-cheat].

While he create this setup, he inevitably start to notice and fix:
* bugs
* annoyances on the public interface of the project
* the devs were using 50 different local scripts to do similar things, all of them semi-broken and limited. Every new hire was copying one of those local scripts, and hacking it up further.
* your crappy build / test / version control setup

Exploiting this skill, however, requires you to trust him.

When he tells to managers that he's good at documenting, they always say: great, we need better documentation! But then, one of the following may happen:
* managers forget that they wanted good documentation and just tell him to code new features as fast as possible
* they don't let him own the getting started page, but rather and expect him to try and fix the existing crappy unfixable existing getting started, without stepping on anyone's pride in the process >:-)

  This makes him tired, and less likely to do a good job.

  Good documentation requires a large number of small iterative reviews, and detailed review of every line is not always feasible.

  Too many cooks.

Ciro's passion for documentation and tooling has the effect that if you have crappy documentation and tooling and don't want them to be fixed, Ciro will end up trying to fix those tools instead of doing what you tell him to do anyways, which might lead to him quitting because he can't stand the tools, or you firing him because he's not doing the job you think I should be doing. So please, don't bother hiring Ciro if you have crappy documentation and tooling.

Psychological analysis of why Ciro has this gift: \x[how-ciro-santilli-manages-to-write-so-much].

Ciro often has the following metaphor in his mind:
\Q[
New discoveries are like very rough trails where you have to cut through heavy bushes (an original \x[research-paper]).

After a brave explorer goes through this rough path for the first time and charts it, it does become much easier for others to follow it later on, but it still requires a lot of effort to go through them, because there are still a lot of rough bushes and some parts of the map are not very clear (reading and reproducing the research paper to further advance the state of the art).

As enough people start going through, the probability that \x[ciro-santilli-s-bad-old-event-memory][someone with a bad memory] ends up walking it increases, and that person ends up pounding the earth into a https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/off-the-beaten-track[beaten track] and increasing the trail clearance of the beginning of the trail at least (\x[review-paper]).

There finally comes a point when even the local government starts to notice this trail is important, and pays someone to add some stone pavement and rails on the most exposed parts of the trail (\x[postgraduate][post] and \x[undergrad] education).

And at last, Ciro Santilli \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions][comes with a bulldozer] and creates \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][an autoroute that thousands of people can cruise at high speed without any effort] (Q&A, \x[open-knowledge] HTML websites).

{parent=ciro-santilli-s-skills}

* \x[english-language]: Cambridge CPE grade B in 2004. Proficient, with minor defects in collocation/pronunciation. Learned from formal courses and from \x[ciro-santilli-s-biography][living in the UK for a few months when he was 10].
* French: TCF grade C2 in 2011. Proficient, with a bit more defects than English. \x[ciro-santilli-s-formal-education][Studied and lived in France].

When asked, Ciro likes to say that he speaks something between 1.5 and 3.5 languages in total, depending on how you count, because Portuguese, French and English are 99.99% the same, and Chinese is completely different but Ciro only knows about 50% of it if counted optimistically.

= Ciro Santilli's psychology and physiology
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli}

Ciro Santilli's energy throughout the day varies as follows:
* morning: highest
* 11AM: peak exercise performance
* after lunch: brain death. Possibly due to Ciro's partial https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siesta[Spanish descent]?
* late afternoon and evening: can do some stuff

Ciro has low tolerance to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation[sleep deprivation] which makes him very irritable, and \x[window-blackout][low ability to sleep if there is any light]. It must have to do with those damned https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell#Ganglion_cell_(non-rod_non-cone)_photoreceptors[ganglion cell photoreceptors].

Ciro has mild https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia[olfactory synesthesia] for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illicium_verum[star anise (八角, bajiao)], which is widely used in \x[chinese-cuisine] and makes Ciro think uncontrollably of the color blue. Ciro does not have any other known synesthesias.

Ciro is a reptilian-like being with cold hands and feet and low blood pressure. For this reason he believes that he will die of \x[cancer] or some respiratory problem. If the \x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china][Chinese government] doesn't get him first that is. This also partly explains why Ciro is not a big fan of swimming.

Besides \x[chinese-food], Ciro really likes \x[eating] fruits and \x[ciro-santilli-s-cooking/roasted-nuts], maybe partly because he was \x[ciro-santilli-s-biography][born in Brazil], and partly because of monkey nature, see \x[ciro-santilli][his Chinese name]. At home he is known as "水果大王" (the big king of the fruits). Ciro is also a sucker for yoghurt (natural without added sugars and full fat, fat-tree yoghurt is terrible, often eaten with fruits). Ciro's "favorite drink" could be tonic water with freshly squeezed lemon. Tied with fresh fruit juices. \x[chocolate]{c}-wise, although not a huge fanatic, a Lindt \x[dark-chocolate] with https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OLP0E9W[whole hazelnut pieces bar] will do the job.

Ciro does not like receiving or giving gifts on expected social situations like birthdays or Christmas. Ciro believes that every day is equally precious, and can be a day to give, be it through awesome \x[open-source-software] contributions, or if you find something that your friend will like

Ciro has some respiratory allergies. When he was around 5, he had relatively serious \x[asthma] crisis which scared parents were scared to death. Throughout his life, he appears to be allergic at an intermediate level to: mold or dust mites (or whatever it is that old books/pillows have), cats (itching on touch), hay fever (in May in the UK, likely grass pollen). Ciro believes however that this also gives him higher resistance to viral infections, since it has been many many years since he had a cold/flu, and when everyone in the office is going down with it, he's just fine. Ciro wonders if his active immune system will actually kill off cancers early, which he ranks as his most likely causes of death, along with respiratory and gastro-intestinal problems. Ciro has low blood pressure and cannot get fat, so cardio vascular problems seem much less likely.

Ciro is generally \x[democrat] due to his high \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-compassionate-personality][compassion level]. He believes that politics is highly genetically determined, and that just like you enter a room full of people and immediately like some and dislike others, the same goes for politics. People just vote for whoever they want to see more of because their way of speaking makes them feel good. There is not rationality involved in it at all.

= Ciro Santilli's self perceived creative personality
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology}

Ciro like to interpret this as him having "a creative \x[personality]" with the tradeoff of generally \x[don-t-be-a-pussy][not being amazing at his well defined jobs].

Ciro is a \x[high-flying-bird-vs-gophers][high flying bird scientist].

Ciro is obsessed by that which is "quirky". This also often \x[quote-afraid-to-do][has a parallel with "naughty"]. He often fantasizes about an imaginary parallel between that feeling and \x[jobs-and-wozniak-s-blue-box].

Ciro's natural fight-or-flight response is to hide in a little corner, and try to solve the problem out. Then get distracted and start \x[procrastinating]. And then he tries to solve the unsolvable. Someone Ciro barely new once told him quite correctly:
\Q[In the event of war, you would be the type that hides away and makes the bombs.]
This is also perhaps why Ciro likes https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Prison_deck[prison decks] in \x[magic-the-gathering]. You just sit on your corner, making yourself safer and safer, until the opponent can't do you any harm and concedes.

There are of course infinitely many videos on the "entrepreneurial mindset" online, and it is impossible to know if they are \x[bullshit], or if everyone just feels like that, but OK, just let Ciro feels that he is specially creative will you?

\Video[http://youtube.com/watch?v=3A0pMX2r2LE]
{title=What Predicts \x[academic]{c} Ability? by \x[jordan-b-peterson] (2017)}

\Q[Creative people continuously step outside of the domain of evaluation structures]
and:
\Q[
If you are creative and you go off on tangents all the time, there's some probability that one of those tangents is going to be exactly what is needed at the time, and you are going to become hyper-successful as a consequence

\[but the probability of that being the right time and place for the idea is extraordinarily low\]

The sensible thing to tell anybody is "you shouldn't do it, your probability of success is so low, that its better to just to something sensible".

But the problem with that, is that creative people can't do that, because they are creative. A creative person who isn't being creative, they just wither and die.
]
Which brings \x[here-s-to-the-crazy-ones] to mind.
}

Ciro also one heard a story, likely apocryphal, but still nonetheless resonated with him, that went something like this (TODO find source, Google wasn't helping, stuff that happened before website as usual):
\Q[
The newly hired manager of some subsection of DuPont (or some other gigantic chemical company) came into the office, and found a chemical engineer, completely drunk in the middle of the day.

Outraged, the manager searched for this colleagues who explained.

Ah, don't mind John (or some other name), the guy invented https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene[Teflon] (or some other substance) which accounted for 20% of our revenue last year. Even if he does not do anything else in his entire career, his salary won't make any difference compared to those gains, and we take the chance that he might invent something else later.
]

Ciro likes this story because although \x[ciro-santilli-s-drug-experiences][he does not drink], he feels his work mind works in a related way. Often, when there is something really hard he knows needs doing he hides, and distracts himself with less important tasks, or by \x[the-best-youtube-channels][watching crap on YouTube], because he knows that the hard task will hurt his mind. Then one day he wakes up and says: OK, \x[fuck] it, let's do it, and does it.

Once Ciro got a performance review from a colleague that said:
\Q[If Ciro spent as much effort on his job as he does on side projects, he'd be the most amazing worker.]
This is closely related to \x[effortless-effort].

Yes, low conscientiousness, give it to me.

He feels that this manifests itself notably through his desire/ability to \x[ciro-santilli-s-documentation-superpowers][create amazing documentation content] and notably \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][for free].

Also related is Ciro's worry about \x[social-inequality] and how to reduce it.

In \x[school], especially before \x[university], Ciro felt that he always treated "the ugly/unpopular" (it is horrifying that such perception of a person exists! but true) girls really well, which led some of them to like him romantically. In part this was de to \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-compassionate-personality] and \x[enter-through-the-narrow-gate] approach to life. But was also partly Ciro's fault, he should have been clearer that he was not truly interested, but he was also lonely, curious about how it was like having girlfriend, and it feels good to have someone like you. This was a \x[sin].

He also feels like he treated working class employees (and don't forget, this is \x[brazil], e.g. his \x[sao-remo-the-favela-next-to-usp][building janitors in São Paulo lived in the nearby favela]!) with extreme equality, sometimes even better, than other richer people.

One thing Ciro does not do however is give money to beggars on the street. Those beggars do make Ciro feel extremely bad for not giving, but he feels that they must be \x[drug-addict]{p} to be out on the street like that, and that this money would be better invested in \x[ourbigbook-com]. But maybe this is just wrong. How fucked up the world is, how far away are we from \x[unconditional-basic-income]???

Once Ciro was hanging out with one of his father's on a group tourist, and she was a lesbian borderline/actually activist social reform person, and she promptly gave to a beggar without batting an eye, and that made a big impression on Ciro, making him feel even worse about himself. 

It must be said that at times this compassion can be a weakness see Ciro's trip to the \x[municipal-market-of-sao-paulo].

https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/无为_(道家)

\x[ciro-santilli] feels that all really important and productive activities come spontaneously, without being internally forced upon people.

You may say that this is because Ciro is lazy and irresponsible, but \x[assign-the-hard-task-to-the-lazy-person][Bill thinks this isn't necessarily always bad]:
\Q[I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.]
This is yet another manifestation of \x[yagni].

As another way to put it, Ciro has very little "self-discipline", and acts very heavily based on small passions that take hold of him. Related: \x[high-flying-bird-vs-gophers].

You may also say that Ciro is an \x[idealist], because what to do when the food will run out and you have to hunt? To which \x[jesus] replies at https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-34&version=NIV[Matthew 6:25-34 "Do Not Worry"] (https://web.archive.org/web/20190801221835/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6%3A25-34&version=NIV[archive]):
\Q[
Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will \x[eat] or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?

And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you - you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?" For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

Ciro is also fond of the description of the work method of some writer that his father told him about, possibly https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami[Haruki Murakami 村上 春樹]. TODO could not find sources, to treat as apocryphal for now. Basically something like:
\Q[Don't rush the work. Just let it happen. Every day at midnight, I would boil a teapot of tea. I would watch the steam rise, and with it feel my consciousness deepen. Everything was pure silence. When the hand was ready, it would, by itself, pick up the brush, and writing would start.]

Another good one is \x[hemingway]'s work method:
\Q[Always stop while you are going good and don't think about it or worry about it until you start to write the next day. That way your subconscious will work on it all the time. But if you think about it consciously or worry about it you will kill it and your brain will be tired before you start.]

Ciro generally feels that many major developments in his life happened "by miracle", beyond his control. So when he saw the quote by \x[carl-jung]:
\Q[Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.]
Ciro tends to do major decisions in his life due to uncontrollable passion rather than logic.

Ciro believes that this is linked to his \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-creative-personality][self perceived creative personality], Because Ciro gives in to such uncontrollable passions, this leads him to do things which are \x[effortless-effort][more unusual/creative], because other more logical people would write such options off as weird.

= Ciro Santilli's bad old event memory
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology}

\x[ciro-santilli] has a bad memory for events that happened a medium time ago, for example in order of months/years. Especially if they are one-off things that have no relation to anything else.

For example, Ciro never remembers which places he travelled to just once, and who was in each trip! He has images of several places he travelled to in his head, and would recognize them, but he just doesn't know where they were!

The same goes for scenes from movies and passages from music, which explains why Ciro's \x[art] consumption focuses on innovative \x[discrete] "what happened" and "general gist" ideas, rather than, analog details such as colors and shapes.

Going back even further in time, Ciro starts to forget the less close friends he had, because the events start to fade away.

Paradoxically however, Ciro believes that this bad memory is one of his greatest strengths and key defining characteristics, because it leads Ciro to want to write down every interesting thing he learns, which motivated \x[ourbigbook-com] and his \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions][Stack Overflow contributions] and his related \x[ciro-santilli-s-documentation-superpowers].

It also somewhat leads Ciro to like \x[physics] and \x[mathematics], because in these fields you \x[formalization-of-mathematics]["can deduce everything"] from very few base principles, so if you forget them, it does not matter that much as you can re-deduce stuff over and over.

Ciro believes that there are two types of people, and most notably \x[software-engineer][software engineers], which are basically data wranglers: those with bad memory and those with good memory.

Those with bad memory, tend to focus on automating and improving their processes a lot. They take much longer to do one-off specific deep knowledge tasks however.

The downside of the good memory ones is that sooner or later they will find tasks that no matter how much memory they have, they cannot solve without automation, and they will fail at those.

Also, good memory people don't enable others to join the project efficiently as much.

This dichotomy also explains why Ciro sucks at code reviews, but is rather the person who runs the interesting patches by himself and finds some critical problems that the more theoretical code reviewers missed.

If Ciro \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][had become a scientist], he would without doubt be an experimentalist, just like in this reality he is a \x[gdb]/runtime person rather than a "static source analysis" person. Those who have bad memory prefer to just run experiments over and over and observe system state at runtime.

Other effects of having a bad memory include:
* code duplication, or a constant fear of it at least, because Ciro forgets that some functionality exists already
* meeting aversion, because everything that is not recorded will fade away
* passion for \x[backward-design], because by the time a piece of knowledge learnt in school might be useful (and 99.99% won't), it will have been long forgotten

\Q[
I'm a physicist and I try to write down things during my own learning process.

In some sense, one of the biggest benefits I have over other people in physics is that I'm certainly not the smartest guy! I usually can't grasp complex issues very easily. So I have to break down complex ideas into smaller chunks to understand it myself. This means, whenever I describe something to others, everyone understands, because it's broken down into such simple terms.

{parent=ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology}
{c}

Just enough money to raise 3 kids in a rich country without having to work (so he can focus on whatever project he wants) and no more. Then maximize fame.

Fame is slightly convertible into money with generally little liquidity, but is more valuable if money becomes useless in a https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TEOTWAWKI[TEOTWAWKI].

Of course, in the end, one just does whatever seems cool and useful, and the Gods decide what proportion of fame/money/power they will get. Due to Ciro's love of \x[open-source-software] however, a higher fame percentage seems more likely than money.

Ciro Santilli's \x[ciro-santilli-s-homonyms][full name is quite unique] and already dominated by this \x[ciro-santilli].

Searching just for just https://www.google.com/search?q=%22santilli%22["Santilli"] on Google does not give any Ciro Santilli hits. The name appears to be a minor variation of the much more common "Santini". Since the name is not that common, it is possible to go over all noteworthy hits. Some relevant ones are shown at: \x[interesting-members-of-the-santilli-family].

Searching just for just https://www.google.com/search?q=%22ciro%22["Ciro"] on Google does not give any Ciro Santilli hits, mostly some smaller brands that could be beaten, this is Ciro's main initial fame metric goal. Reaching it would require doing things known much beyond the programming community however, as Ciro has done until of 2019. http://ciro.com is from an electromechanics consultancy https://web.archive.org/web/20190610202635/http://ciro.com/[as of 2019], so it's not bad, let them be.

At the next useless gamified level, an honorary https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire[OBE] and more ambitiously https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_Royal_Society[ForMemRS] from the \x[royal-society] post nominal letters would be nice.

The ultimate dream however would be to beat https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great[Cyrus the Great] himself on Google searches ("Ciro" == "Cyrus" in Portuguese), maybe becoming "Cyrus the Greater"? That one will be a bit harder though.

= Cirodance
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology}

During his teenage years, Ciro created an innovative new dance style combining elements of the various corporal practices that he studied a bit of across the years:
* Kung Fu/Taichi
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(Brazilian_dance)#Samba_Ax%C3%A9[Brazilian Axé] and Capoeira
* Breakdance
* Yoga
* Modern dance

Ciro later called this style Cirodance.

Ciro's legendary dance style was famous during his university years, when Ciro would go to parties and dance like made while mostly unsuccessfully trying to woo girls.

Ciro has always been critical of dancing conditions in University parties, where people would \x[enter-through-the-narrow-gate][always be cramped up doing boring non-creative moves]. Rather, Ciro would go to to the edges of the dance floor to have enough space for his amazing moves. There is a perhaps a parallel between such tendencies and Ciro's \x[high-flying-bird-vs-gophers][highly innovative personality]. Also perhaps being cramped would have helped wooing said girls.

Ciro later quit dancing, to a large extent because it is too hard to find suitable dancing locations outside: \x[europe] is too cold much of the year, also ground conditions have to be perfect, and no patience to book a dance room somewhere. Kid's playgrounds are \x[ideal], but Ciro is afraid of dancing there because kids parent's would freak out.

Therefore, all evidence of Cirodance seems to have disappeared into the depths of the Internet. There used to be a notorious video on YouTube from around June 2010 entitled "A Piriguete da Poli !!" ("\x[university-of-sao-paulo][Poli's] bitch" in Portuguese) with comment "Sem comentarios... foi a atraçao da cervejada" (No comments... was the main attraction of the beer party) dancing the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tfrdu7i56Mg[Piriguete by MC Papo] Brazilian https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk_carioca[Funk carioca] song. But the video was removed at some point, they were likely afraid of getting sued, the URL was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T969azGjIeE[] as shown at https://www.facebook.com/cirosantilli/posts/133333123357495[], but this was before Ciro noticed that every good thing on the web goes down and became an obsessive \x[web-archiving][web archiver]. But in any case, the title gives an idea of the amazing style of Ciro's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_inspiration[furor poeticus] Axé performance on that day. If the video owner ever reads this message, please please restore the video, or send Ciro a copy. TODO: which channel was it on? Knowing that Ciro would be able to try and contact them.

One legendary episode linked to Cirodance was when Ciro was living in \x[paris] and jobless around 2014 (but not destitute as he leached from his girlfriend). Cirodance was his main physical activity at the time, and \x[place-de-la-republique], where the skateboarders hung out due to the perfect wide concrete floor and relatively close to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Bastille[Bastille] where Ciro lived, was the perfect place for it. One cold dark winter evening, Ciro was practicing Cirodance with his headphones and crappy clothes (dirty public square floor, remember), when someone took him for a homeless person and offered him a bowl of soup! It must be said that Place de la République had many events of giving food to the poor. Ciro was a bit stunned, declined, and continued dancing. And so that was the day when a prestigious \x[ecole-polytechnique][Polytechnicien] was mistaken for a homeless person. And Ciro \x[ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology][liked that].

As of 2021, \x[googling] "cirodance" leads to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyvv4ddL2so "Ciro Dance" in which comedian "Ciro Priello" (no \x[wikipedia] page at the time) participates in a comedy show with a "silly dance" (TODO this likely has a name) described in the comments as:

It's a brand new Italian format. Some comedians are grouped into a room where they have full access to different kind of items and tools. Laughing means losing. Each of them can try to make the other laugh. The winner gets some money but all of them would have give that to charity.

The dancing guy, Ciro, after only 10 minutes from the start did this nonsense dance. It's silly bit fun nonetheless I guess

= Ciro Santilli's knee
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-body}

If https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel[Achilles' had his heel], Ciro had his knee.

First \x[ciro-santilli-s-formal-education][during University in Brazil] while trying https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWXD0JbwT-w[a kick up] during the development of \x[cirodance] his knee went a bit weird for a few weeks.

Then, just after arriving in France for \x[ecole-polytechnique], the boys were playing indoor \x[soccer], and to impress the girls Ciro was playing really hard, even took off his shirt, and suddenly when he was running by himself his knee snapped, he fell and it hurt like hell.

Ciro was on crutches for a few weeks, but the \x[inflammation] went away, but then he tried to play more soccer, but the knee was not as stable as before, and once he tried to run full speed, it slipped and hurt him a bit more (less severely) and so he gave up. For some reason it was not visible on the tomography made at the hospital.

Maybe Ciro should have investigated more though, certainly an experienced doctor could have done a hand pressure exam to determine which joint was damaged manually even. That was a medical failure.

So from this day on Ciro gave up on all interesting sports, and confined himself to more repetitive stuff like gym weights and cycling: \x[ciro-santilli-s-sport-practice]{full}. At Polytechnique he was forced to take up swimming as his mandatory sport, that was unbearably boring.

This defect is likely genetic since a close relative had similar problems.

But oh well, his then not-even girlfriend was impressed enough by the soccer or sorry enough for the sucker to marry him, so it worked out.

= Ciro Santilli's legs sometimes itch when he runs
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-body}

\x[ciro-santilli] has an undiagnozed condition where his upper legs and lower torso often start to itch when he runs, to the point of being extremely annoying and removing all pleasure form the activity.

If some doctor knows why this could be, please tell him!!!

The problem is a bit hard to reproduce however, and Ciro hasn't been able to determine which exact condition triggers it: temperature, nutrition, something else?

Ciro believes that this is not chiefly due to transpiration, but rather to the impact motion that running does on the muscles, as he has felt something similar on his arms some times while cycling in very rough terrain, which made his arms shake in a similar fashion.

Interestingly, Ciro didn't feel that at all when he \x[ciro-santilli-s-sport-practice][played soccer enthusiastically as a child], and he was one of the fastest runners of the group for sure at that time. So he's not sure if it started when he got older, or if it is just because the difference in workloads between soccer and running.

{parent=ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology}

As a \x[brazilian], \x[ciro-santilli] used to really love playing \x[soccer] (\x[rooting-for-sport-teams][but not watching it]), until \x[ciro-santilli-s-knee][he hurt his knee].

Playing soccer just feels amazing, because you are constantly running around, but with a more specific goal in mind: to get that ball into that goal!

Playing soccer was specially amazing in \x[santos-sao-paulo-brazil][the flat wet sand beach of Santos]. \x[weekend], the sea, feet touching the sand, the sun going down, and your school mates next to you. Nirvana.

It is also true that under those conditions, the skin of your feet will get ripped off due to running on the slightly wet and flat sand no matter how thick it has become. But it is worth it.

Teams would often be slit between "the team with shirts vs the team without shirts", who would just take off their shirts. The two best players would take turns picking players into their teams, the first one to pick would be decided by \x[odds-and-evens-hand-game] (par ou ímpar).

A pair of Havaianas, or Havaianas rip-offs, stuck into the sand, or even just some school bags, would do as a goal posts. More organized people, especially adults, would have their own water pipe goal with a proper net and all. But doing so would spoil the fun of endless discussions if a non flat ball had gone in or not into an imaginary rectangle. 

That's how soccer was meant to be played.

Ciro became however disillusioned with soccer after his injury. It is a shame.

And so after that, Ciro decided to dedicate himself to sports where you can't hurt your knee.

Ciro \x[ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology][hates water], so swimming is out of the question. What could be more boring than going back and forth on a fixed location a million times to gain some milliseconds?

And so Ciro has been left with the gym as the only main option for a while.

Running would have been a consideration, but \x[ciro-santilli-s-legs-sometimes-itch-when-he-runs].

This is until he ended up living in a place with decent roads for cycling in the late 2010's, which led to \x[ciro-santilli-s-cycling].

= Ciro Santilli's cycling
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-sport-practice}

At first, \x[ciro-santilli] was just cycling to work with an extremely shitty bike he bought on a second hand shop. He knew nothing about bicycles, and the seat was way, way too low, the seller should be prosecuted for selling that to him. Ciro later understood that this was even a woman's bicycle with a low top tube! That's what you get for \x[ciro-santilli-s-cheapness][being so cheap].

But then at some point he bought another \x[ciro-santilli-s-hardware/kross-bicycle-2017][slightly less cheap touring bicycle], but this time from a much more trustworthy source: a colleague who was leaving the company and moving out, and this one was actually reasonable. It was the right size to start with!!! And so at some point, out of boredom, Ciro started to adventure out of town on weekends to neighbouring villages, and it just felt so good.

Ciro had started by taking his laptop-\x[computer] on his backpack, and stopping at a cafe on some nearby town where he would do some coding over the weekends. Especially during winter, \x[ciro-santilli-s-drug-experiences][drinking tea with a cake] as a break during bicycle ride was the best thing ever. In one place, there was even an electric heater that you could sit in front of. But at some point, those rides start being too short, and you start doing longer real rides without your computer. And since those take more time, you generally don't feel like staying on a far place for a very long time. So you end up creating the "real ride" category and "a small ride to get somewhere nice to code" category clearly split.

He had had the "cyclists high" version of "runner's high". A light euphoria in your head, or a pulsating feeling of pleasure in your legs and lower torso. This reminded Ciro of:
* a video where a ex-\x[heroin] addict describes taking heroin as having an \x[orgasm] in your entire body, also known as "body high"https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-a-head-high-and-a-body-high{ref}https://youtu.be/Fa-BktzJrWs?t=610{ref}. In cycling it is mostly a https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Legasm[legasm] though.
* \x[trainspotting-1996]'s \x[orgasm] scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUaXbM_lZj0
except that it is not as intense, and does not destroy your life.

Like other \x[drug]{p}:
* it is addictive
* you will have some \x[bad-trip]{p}, e.g. went the wrong way on a highway and are afraid you are going to die crushed by fast cars, got flat tire on 1 hour ride and have no repair kit, destination cafe is closed and you are hungry, wind got so strong you can barely ride, half an hour in you find out that it is way colder than what you expected.

  But for every such experience you survive, you learn something to reduce the chances it will happen, and it later feels great to completely master a situation you had suffered previously with.

  Ciro has also come to crave the need to go back to every bad trip spot, with better planning and circumstances, and make it feel amazing, to get the feeling that he has mastered the spot.
* you will have hangover after a long amazing ride
* the high become less intense the more you ride, and turns into something you have to do to just to feel normal. And that keeps you fit forever :)

Cycling just gives you an amazing sense of freedom! Ciro likes to imagine himself as a migratory duck when he is riding his bike on cold or wet days.

The prospect of being able to reach nice new places keeps the experience fresh for a very long time.

Ciro likes to decide location on a whim on the day prior. He checks the wind to try and ride parallel to it, and then let's his mind wonder, until an image comes up, some some nice place Ciro was to once. And so the next day, he goes in that general direction again.

Each time you try to find a new cool location, and sometimes you just stumble into amazing stuff without knowing about it. Ciro likes to keep open to new experiences. Keep your eyes open, and if something looks curious, just check it out! Talking to locals for tips is also a great way to find new stuff.

One thing that Ciro often feels is rather excited on the way out, and lightly afraid of going futher at each step because of the return. And during the return, there is a greater feeling of worry and resignation, as you are more tired, you've seen what you wanted to, and you just have to get yourself homehow, often going back through paths that you know better. This reminds Ciro of the ending of the film \x[in-the-realm-of-the-senses-1976], in which the sex obsessed couple plays a strangling sex game, and the man says that it hurts too much when she stops strangling him, and so she strangles him to death. She also cut his \x[penis] and carried it around in a bag afterwards, but that not relevant to the cycling analogy.

It is funny, but sometimes this gives Ciro the same feeling that he had as a child playing 2D exploration RPGs such \x[pokemon] and \x[final-fantasy-vi] as you explore the wild: Ciro can often hear the FF VI overworld soundtrack, or imagine that a Charmeleon is hidden just around the corner of this new towns he's never been to before. Because in the places you live and have walked a million times, you know there is no magic. But in a new place that you're visiting for the first time? Anything is possible there.

The main difference from video games is that the real world is much much more detailed and diverse, and the freedom is much more real. Also you can't just walk into any house or field like in the games, and there are more empty or repetitive areas that can sometimes get boring since they weren't hand designed. And if you die on a car crash there are no continues.

Another type of game that comes to mind are \x[survival-game]{p} and \x[roguelike]{p}, where it feels amazing to learn things that actually mean the difference between life and death, and conquering the environment. But also permadeath.

It also gives Ciro the magic feeling of awe that he had as a child when walking around his beloved hometown of \x[santos-sao-paulo-brazil] in the sunshine. And sometimes the feeling of excitement that he had as a child before getting gifts for Christmas. Ciro then once watched a \x[youtube] video where ex-\x[heroin] addicts describe the feeling of taking heroin (orally, TODO can't find the video anymore, I think https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa-BktzJrWs[it was this guy]) exactly like that: the anticipation of getting Christmas gifts, and he instantly understood.

Ciro also likes to pick random gravel from time to time. He believes that his style of route choice reflects \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-creative-personality]: Ciro likes to go where few other people go. And he only needs to go there once to be satisfied, not master and speedrun it afterwards.

Ciro avoids riding at night of course. But when it happens and you are prepared with the safety lights and the route knowledge, it makes for some of the most memorable rides of your life.

As you start cycling, you can feel the endorphins levels rise little by little, and your mind go deeper and deeper into slumber, getting close and closer to the ground, until you reach a point where you feel like you are part of the road. \x[trainspotting-1996]'s overdose scene comes to mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=66&v=_IDJpB9de3E

It is amazing how you feel much less cold and hunger when cycling, to the point of being dangerous: always carry some chocolate bars in case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFZ0aYz71Tw[you hit the wall]! This is especially true at the beginning of the addiction, but with increased \x[drug-tolerance] and knowledge/awareness/preparation, this starts to feel more normal.

As a friend of Ciro once said: you start to become like a wolf, who knows every cyclable little road in a 30km radius around your home.

As of 2020, Ciro is at that "should I buy a more reasonable road bike" moment. Let's see how it goes. If he does, cycling trips with the bike on a plane are likely.

As a \x[software-engineer], trying to repair a mechanical system like his bike reminds Ciro very strongly of how the \x[deep-tech][physical engineering is brutal]. Millimetric changes can make huge differences, it is \x[mind-blowing]! Good lesson to have in mind.

Another thought that often comes to Ciro's mind is that bicycles are not regular possessions because they break a lot. Rather, they must be seen as a kind of transportation tax that you have to pay to feel amazing riding them rather than feel crappy riding a bus or train.

One interesting feeling that Ciro gets from cycling is that it is an intermediate between walking and riding a car. Ciro felt this especially strongly when he lived near work, at a distance that you could either walk or cycle. When you walk, you can just see so much more of the surroundings, it is astonishing. When you cycle, you just go much faster, and you attention is much more towards the front, so you feel surroundings much less. On the other side, cycling allows you to feel different things. E.g. in wider open areas, there isn't much detail to see anyway, so you can better feel those areas on the faster speed of the bike. A similar feeling applies to how pedestrians feel like flies when you are on a bike, just like you must feel like a fly to car drivers. Ciro later learnt that a person of similar literary ability to his, \x[ernest-hemingway], https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Cycling[had a famous related similar quote]:
\Q[
It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best, since you have to sweat up the hills and can coast down them.... Thus you remember them as they actually are, while in a motorcar only a high hill impresses you, and you have no such accurate remembrance of country you have driven through as you gain by riding a bicycle.
]

Although Ciro does not run because of his \x[ciro-santilli-s-legs-sometimes-itch-when-he-runs][itchy legs issue], he finds it interest to contrast cycling with running, notably:
* cycling has a much higher setup time or wearing appropriate clothes, unlocking your bike, and of course, \x[ciro-santilli-s-bicycle-wisdom][bike maintenance]
* running allows you to go into many more small paths that are not accessible by bike, thus offering a different sense of freedom. You can't go as far however.
So maybe the ultimate sport would be to cycle to a good cross-country running location and then run over there?

Sometimes, these are more than just mechanics, but also have deeper life analogues. The title of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance] comes to mind. Sometimes they are just mechanics.

With more philosophical metaphors:
* when your bike breaks, that provides an unique opportunity to learn how to fix it: \x[try-to-fix-your-own-bike-before-taking-it-to-the-shop]
* if the wind is blowing against you on the way out, it will likely blow behind you on the way back. But remember that the other way around also applies.
* always take one extra clothing layer than what you think you will need in your back pocket or sport bag, especially when time is changing fast in Sprint and Autumn. The weather on the road outside of town can change very quickly!
* if you took a turn, and it feels wrong, stop to check the map, and possibly backtrack to safety. When it feels wrong, it usually is a bad idea, e.g. roads where cars are too fast/too many. But if you take a wrong turn and it feels right, then follow it without fear and see what it leads to!
* don't carry a speedometer on your bike. Analysis can be done afterwards on \x[strava]. The only measurement that matters is "how awesome am I feeling right now?". \x[buddhism][Live in the moment] instead of checking your speedometer every 10 seconds.
* cycle when you body calls it out of addiction, not out a goal that you've made up that must be reached

With less philosophical metaphors:
* learn how much water and food you need to take for a trip. Otherwise, you \i[will] bonk at some time, when you least expect, it happens very suddenly.

  And then you better hope to God that you can find a food shop nearby. Luckily this was the case for Ciro's first and only bonk so far.

  You will also learn that, surprise surprise, \x[carbohydrate]{p} that you ate one or two days before a ride stay stored in your liver and muscles, and also greatly affect how quickly you will bonk, thus the concept of \x[carbohydrate-loading].

  {title=How Not To 'Hit The Wall' Or 'Bonk' – GCN's Guide To Fuelling While Cycling by Global Cycling Network (2016)}

  And surprise surprise: heat can also make you bonk! Who would have thought!
* correct saddle hight is fundamental, your legs must be almost fully stretched at the bottom position
* it is impossible to reach the correct tire pressure with (cheap?) hand pumps, their only purpose is to fill up a flat tire so you can get home after a long ride. But a track pump.
* clean and lube your chain. The speed benefit is instantaneous and \x[mind-blowing]. It also greatly improves gear shifting.

  This also prevents the chain from rusting, because the lube takes up the place where water would stay, and the muck makes it harder for water to evaporate.

  This is the most common bike maintenance mistake you see on the streets: people with that high pitched overly dry chain noise.

  \Video[http://youtube.com/watch?v=KM6mzE5lQ0w]
  {title=How To Get A Perfectly Clean Chain by GCN (2016)}
* when a piece on your bike breaks and has no clear name written on it, you can try to identify it Google images
* the more you watch \x[youtube] maintenance videos without haste, the more you end up learn random new stuff that unexpectedly saves you later
* if you took a turn, and it feels wrong, stop to check the map, and possibly backtrack to safety. When it feels wrong, it usually is a bad idea, e.g. roads where cars are too fast/too many
* public place with lots of people are bicycle parking \x[hell], because due to \x[anonymity] and the large number of distractions, it becomes exponentially more likely that someone will \x[fuck] you bike somehow, e.g. by dropping it on the ground. Always search a bit for a reasonable place to park, and avoid overcrowded parking spaces at all costs.
* gear change matters
  * when you get on your bike to start riding, start riding slowly and gradually switch up pedal forces and gears. Things may have shifted in a weird position as it gets kicked around in parking. Ciro managed to bend his derailleur like that!
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43ci68I23hA[spin to win], AKA learn to user your gears
  * it is not shameful to ride on your lower gears on a hill. You can actually go surprisingly fast with them, and conserve energy for later. Learn when to use each gear ratio.
* learn to identify your suppliers:
  * https://www.wiggle.co.uk/[]: in \x[europe], this is best place to buy clothing from, and also good for some bike parts. It is the most organized website, and contains non-generic \x[shit] which \x[amazon-company] is full of.

    For bike parts Amazon is also worth looking into however. Bike parts a bit different from clothing because you have to make sure that stuff fits, so you hopefully know exactly the part name before before buying it, and therefore website organization is not as crucial.

    Wiggle is however guilty of shameless: \x[discounts-that-happen-more-often-than-not]
* always take your lights off the bike into your bag when you park, anywhere, and for any amount of time, even if a quick stop. \x[drug-addict]{c}{p} are everywhere, always ready love to steal and resell them.
* sometimes you do something stupid like going into a really muddy path, and it is really fun, because you've never been there in your life. But then your bike gets really dirty, and your feet are wet and freezing, and you promis yourself you will never do something that stupid again. But then you do it again in a different location, because it was too much fun. \x[once-more-unto-the-breach]{c} just comes to Ciro's mind every such time. Embrace this.

= Try to fix your own bike before taking it to the shop
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-bicycle-wisdom}

Sometimes you get annoyed to death with your bike not breaking or changing gears perfectly as you would like, and the people at the bike shop never do the job well enough.

The problem with bike shops is that the employees are already swamped with work, and they don't get paid any extra for doing more work.

As a result, paradoxically, they are often happier, and respect you more if you are trying to get them to help you to fix your own bike!

Also, for the same reason, they don't have the time to go for a quick test ride after a fix to ensure that the \x[software-engineer][bug] was actually fixed.

So they ignore things that would obviously be huge ridability benefits (although they might not be obvious to newbie customers), for which customers would gladly pay more money for.

But you start to learn how to do stuff yourself and it feel amazing when you finally get there (after infinite trial and error).

Ciro dreams of a bike shop that actually calls you for the appointment and then teaches you how to fix the thing.

So the best strategy is to have a backup bicycle, and when your main one breaks, you just try to to the fix yourself. That means:
* identifying the broken piece
* watching YouTube videos of how to do the job
* buying a replacement and any missing tools on \x[amazon-company]
* giving it a shot

Then, if you fail to do the fix, that is OK, just take it to the bike shop, with the piece you've bought, and ask them to do it for you. At least this way you did not waste a golden opportunity to learn!

= Ciro Santilli's dreams
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology}

\x[ciro-santilli]'s dreams almost all include the following aspect: Ciro is trying to do something mundane, like climbing a hill, walking across town, etc. but doing so it extremely difficult. The hill is too steep, he gets lost, and things which are easy to use in real life are impossibly hard to use in the dream.

So they are a bit like \x[nightmare]{p}, but not that bad. Just really annoying and tiresome. Still, Ciro does enjoy o visiting the semi-real places those dreams bring him to, much for the same reasons he \x[ciro-santilli-s-cycling][enjoys cycling].

Ciro attributes this type of dream to his occupation as a \x[software-engineer], because that's basically the feeling you get all day from it: why isn't this working!!! It is so basic!!!

= Ciro Santilli's cheapness
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology}

When Ciro was a teenager, he was extremely cheap e.g. for clothes, food and \x[video-game]{p} even tough his family didn't have bad financial conditions.

This was mostly to save the world by not wasting resources that other people in need could use, and to save money so he could have more money to do \x[unconditional-basic-income][more of whatever he wanted without the obligation to work].

But Ciro admits that shocking people with the incredible level of low quality goods was also fun.

Ciro changed \x[ciro-santilli-s-formal-education][after he came to Europe], especially in regards to food, perhaps corrupted by the fact that now the best chocolates, cheeses and breads in the world were not much more expensive than the cheapest brand you could buy. He still \x[luxury-goods][hates clothes that are just to look good like costumes though].

Living close to a small \x[favela], \x[sao-remo-the-favela-next-to-usp], helped Ciro get frighteningly cheap goods on the shop frequented by the favela neighbours.

One legendary story is that of when his flatmate dropped some past on the kitchen floor, and the bowl broke, but Ciro prevented the flatmate from throwing it away and ate some of it nevertheless. What spooked them out the most was Ciro's statement that the pasta now had a crunchy glass shard texture to it.

= Ciro Santilli's love advice
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-psychology-and-physiology}

In the field of Love and Friendship, Ciro is a big believer in the merciless application of \x[tit-for-tat]. Never desire someone's love if you give and what comes back is not proportional. Cut your attempts to reach out immediately in such cases.

Never tell a woman you like her before she is in your bed.

If someone likes you and you don't like them as much, make that clear to them. Don't put this off, be it for \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-compassionate-personality][compassion], curiosity, loneliness, or \x[narcissism].

= Ciro Santilli's drug experiences
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli}

\x[ciro-santilli] never did any \x[illegal] drugs, because he:
* doesn't want to help fund \x[organized-crime]. Notably, Ciro is for complete \x[legalization-of-drugs] of all drugs
* already has better more sustainable drugs like \x[ciro-santilli-s-wife][love], \x[ciro-santilli-s-cycling][cycling], learning the \x[natural-science]{p} and \x[ciro-santilli-s-selfish-desires][fame]. He (or more realistically, the world) \x[trainspotting-1996][chose life for him].
so don't expect any amazing stories here.

Like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_Wisdom[LDS believers], Ciro never drinks coffee nor smokes, and only drinks alcohol and tea sparingly, because they are all addictive \x[drug]{p} and bring no net increase of energy and concentration.

Ciro prefers to only enjoy a glass of tea \x[ciro-santilli-s-sport-practice][when going out cycling on a cold day] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Grey_tea[Earl gray], with milk, no sugar), or get a half pint of beer when going out with friends to a pub.

Ciro only got reasonably drunk twice on his life:
* once when he was quite young, likely pre-10 years old, while visiting an uncle's home, and adults were having a very nice sweet and thick type of alcoholic cocktail, and Ciro drank a bit too much and that made him really really stupid
* once while studying at \x[university-of-sao-paulo], somehow someone was giving free beers at one of the parties (at which Ciro practiced \x[cirodance]). And since Ciro had always been a \x[ciro-santilli-s-cheapness][cheap-ass], he thought, hey, this is a good chance to try it out. Ciro remembers that this made him a bit euphoric, active, very stupid, and a bit \x[horny] (though of course, he got no pussy as usual).

Later in life, around the time of \x[ciro-santilli-s-wedding][his wedding], there were guests around all the time, and he was drinking beer with them all the time. Then one day, during lunch, Ciro felt a weirdly strong desire to drink one more pint. It was at this point that Ciro realised first-hand what mild, but real, alcohol addiction felt like, and he didn't get that drink, and swore from then on to never drink more than one glass a week, and only with friends at a bar after work. \x[richard-feynman] tells a very similar story on his book \x[surely-you-re-joking-mr-feynman-chapter-o-americano-outra-vez], see: \x[richard-feynman-s-drug-use]{full}.

= The bullying of young Ciro Santilli
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-biography}

When \x[ciro-santilli] was very young, about 6, he was a \x[fatty], and other \x[evil] boys picked on him.

Ciro was even more stupid than as of 2020, and continued to try and hang out with those evil kids to show them he was cool too or that he was strong, and so continued to get hurt.

Advice to his children: stay away from evil people.

The bullied sometimes feels an almost masochistic desire to overcome the bullies' contempt, and to try and either become friends with the bullies, or to overpower them.

You must never give into those thoughts.

If you come across evil people, smile a fake smile to them, and walk away, but never give your back to them, and always be ready to fight.

If they laugh at you, know that you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes_3#Verse_20[are shit] like everyone else, pretend to laugh with them, take their post and repost it on your public profile, and silently stay away from those idiots.

Never show any weakness.

If a fight is likely, always be ready, always have your friends nearby, be as well armed as the enemy, and never be outnumbered.

On the \x[internet], never care about e-bully posts, either block them immediately, and anyone that likes their posts, or follow https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/tree/56f678e776fabf738142bbc3d8e10c6f1c49bd5e#reply-policy[Ciro's reply policy].

Call parents or other authorities as soon as there is risk of physical harm. Better a living free \x[don-t-be-a-pussy][pussy] than dead or in youth detention for murder. Similar advice applies if you are going to jail I guess.

If a physical fight is inevitable however, https://biblehub.com/luke/6-29.htm[ignore Jesus this once and don't give the other face], but rather follow the \x[talmud] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_shall_fight_on_the_beaches[fight all out on the beaches]:
\Q[If someone comes to kill you, rise and kill first.]

The \x[sikh] knife, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirpan[Kirpan], which Sikhs must carry at all times as a religious obligation, also comes to mind. The Sikh must have been bullied out of the their minds at some point in history, Ciro understands.

Non-violence only works when you have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence[bodies to spare from your followers].

Perhaps it was good to learn those lessons early, before the stakes were too high. Adults fake it much better, and therefore it is harder to learn those lessons from them, but they are still just as evil on the inside.

These experiences might have contributed to \x[ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-compassionate-personality].

= Ciro Santilli's 10 month stay in Coventry, United Kingdom, in the year 2000
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-biography}

In the year 2000, Ciro lived with his parents for 10 months in the \x[coventry] because his father took some courses at the \x[university-of-warwick]. This was Ciro's most important educational experience, more so than any other in\x[ciro-santilli-s-formal-education], because it taught him the Holy Language of \x[english-language], which infinitely expanded Ciro's \x[internet] horizons, and shaped Ciro's \x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world] philosophy. When he came back to Brazil, Ciro skipped dozens of levels in his English school in \x[santos-sao-paulo-brazil], a Brazilian chain called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultura_Inglesa[Cultura Inglesa], and was put to study with much older teenagers who marveled at Ciro's incredibly cute, but since lost, British accent.

Another huge advantage of Coventry is that the https://hearsallacademy.org/[Hearsall Community Primary School] where Ciro studied was a regular British primary school but with two classes dedicated to foreign students to learn English before integrating with the British students. There were a several kids from Kosovo there due to the \x[kosovo-war] which was just ending, and it was there that Ciro made his first \x[chinese] friend, yet unaware of course of the \x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china][role the country would later play in his life]. One particularly fun memory was that of playing \x[soccer] on the school playground with a sponge ball to avoid breaking the windows. Then one day it was raining, \x[british-weather] of course, but Ciro still went for a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)[header], and the soaked sponge ball was soaked and splashed Ciro with dirty water all over. Good days.

Ciro also played a bit of Rugby in those days in a local club.

Some other good memories are of reading the first two \x[harry-potter]{p}, \x[games-young-ciro-santilli-played][playing and mostly watching other kids play Pokemon on their Game Boys and Pokemon trading cards], and going to a nearby commons playing field and woods, as it typical throughout the UK. Ciro also played some rugby with a local boys team TODO name? but for some reason his team was always crushed when they went to nearby towns to play against other teams. And Ciro also went with his family or with school to some nearby attractions, like Stratford-Upon-Avon (Shakespeare's hometown), and some castles.

See also further remarks on Ciro Santilli's \x[linkedin]: https://www.linkedin.com/in/cirosantilli/

Despite studying in great institutions with great teachers, Ciro feels that:
* \x[ciro-santilli-s-skills][most of what he knows] came from the Internet, man pages, books and his parents
* \x[the-most-important-projects-done-by-ciro-santilli][actual projects] matter much more than those pieces of paper called Diplomas. You should not do like Ciro who basically did nothing but school mandated work, but \x[don-t-be-a-pussy][instead grow some balls and focus much more or entirely on your projects]

This motivated Ciro to work on \x[ourbigbook-com].

= Ciro Santilli's musical education
{c}
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-biography}

Ciro's parents put him to play the piano. This is partly influenced by Ciro's paternal grandfather, an energetic Italian descendant who liked music

\Image[Six_year_old_Ciro_Santilli_when_his_grandfather_offered_him_an_electronic_keyboard.jpg]

The piano was fine, but a bit boring due to how it was taught.

The teachers were nice old ladies who followed a very traditional and methodic approach which was just like \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][regular school], instead of doing what actually needed to be done: inspire kids into becoming creative musical geniuses that can compose their own stuff.

While in \x[santos-sao-paulo-brazil][Santos], before going to university, Ciro somehow got into acoustic and \x[electric-guitar].

The \x[electric-guitar] environment was much less formalized in general, and he took courses with http://www.maurohector.com.br/[an awesome teacher] (https://web.archive.org/web/20190107231749/http://www.maurohector.com.br/[archive]), who actually tried to inspire his students to create their own music and improvisation.

And so a young teenage Ciro once seriously considered becoming a professional \x[the-best-modern-instrumental-western-music][guitar player].

In his early teens, Ciro listened to the usual canned music his friends listened to: \x[music-teenager-ciro-santilli-liked-to-listen-to], until he started to stumble upon \x[jazz].

Ciro remembers clearly rainy \x[weekend][weekend] days where he would go to a run down second hand shop near his home in someone's garage (Sebo do Alfaiate, R. Frei Francisco de Sampaio, 183 - Embaré, Santos - SP, 11040-220, Brazil :-)), and buy amazing second hand Jazz CDs. It was just a matter of time until he would start scouring the web for "the best jazz albums of all time" and start listening to all of them, see e.g. \x[the-best-modern-instrumental-western-music]. https://digitaldreamdoor.com/index.html was a good resource from those times!

Ciro ultimately decided \x[ciro-santilli-s-bad-old-event-memory][his bad memory] and overwhelming \x[ourbigbook-com/motivation][passion for the natural sciences] would better suit a scientific carrier.

He also learnt that the \x[computer] is also an extremely satisfying artistic instrument.

Also, with a computer, boring dexterity limitations are no more: you can just record perfect played segments or program things note by note to achieve whatever music or action you want!

Although Ciro quit playing musical instruments, his \x[music][passion for the music has remained], and who knows how it has influenced his life.

\Q[
"The earth moved," Maria said, not looking at Pilar. "Truly. It was a thing I cannot tell thee."

"It never moves more than three times in a lifetime. Did it really move?" Pilar Said.

"Yes," the girl said. "Truly."

"For you, Inglés?" Pilar looked at Robert Jordan. "Don't lie."

"Yes," he said. "Truly."

\Q[
The first one came to me as if coming from the flower shop\br
Brought a stuffed toy, brought an amethyst pin\b
He told me about his journey and the perks he had\b
He showed me his watch and called me 'queen'\b
He found me so undefended that he touched my heart\b
But he denied me nothing, so, frightened, I said 'no'

The second came to me as if coming back from the bar\br
Brought a bottle of brandy too bitter to swallow\br
He asked me about my past and sniffed my food\br
He searched through my drawer and called me 'the lost one'\br
He found me so undefended that he scratched my heart\br
But he gave me nothing, so, frightened, I said 'no'

The third one arrived like he was arriving from nowhere\br
He brought me nothing and also asked me nothing\br
I barely know his name but I understand what he wants\br
He laid on my bed and called me 'woman'\br
He arrived very sneakily and before I could say 'no'\br
He settled inside my heart as its owner

Where most of \x[ciro-santilli]'s ancestors came from, and why Ciro has the \x[italian] nationality as well as \x[brazilian].

More specifically his paternal line comes from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gissi[Gissi in the Abruzzo region].

Ciro feels really bad by the fact that he does not speak Italian and has never visited Gissi as of 2020.

He would likely be able to learn Italian in like 3 months because it is so similar to \x[ciro-santilli-s-natural-languages-skills][Portuguese and French which he already speaks].

And a \x[ciro-santilli-s-sport-practice][cycling visit maybe]? That would be amazing! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giro_d'Abruzzo[] | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW7wqa3vNU8&list=UU35qUU5iZPvuzcre43EV8bA&index=25[]

For what it is worth though, \x[ciro-santilli] does honestly love \x[europe], and feels a strong desire to make it even awesomer, along with the rest of the world. Despite this being a hopeless attempt due to \x[having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world].

{tag=the-correlation-between-software-engineers-and-buddhism}
{title2=2012}

Firstly, in 2012, while he was at \x[ecole-polytechnique], \x[ciro-santilli] was introduced to \x[latex] (thank God for \x[french] mathematical obsession, and his mind was blown:
\Q[Ha, so I can write my own books, and so can anyone, for free?]
he though. Why isn't everyone doing that!

One particular event stood out: Ciro made a small change to his teacher's course material, who https://webia.lip6.fr/~durrc/[blessed be him] (dude's a legend, Ciro just noticed he has some Chinese publications with another French dude, e.g. https://www.amazon.co.uk/高效算法-应试与提高必修128例-克里斯托弗-Christoph-Durr/dp/B078SJQPVK "High-efficiency algorithm competitions 128 examples", did he write it the Chinese himself?? Must be of course to complement the notoriously low French professor salaries), made it available, and then Ciro gave him back the .tex file. Ciro was just a bit worried about how the teacher would be able to tell what he had changed in the file to validate the change. The teacher just said of course, "no problem, I'll just use \x[diff]". Ciro had never heard of diff. Let alone \x[git] of course, though yes, this was a bit early in Git's history \x[version-control] systems had been around since forever of course. This was 2011 or 2012, \x[ciro-santilli-s-formal-education][about 4 or 5 years into a superior education] curricula with various courses involving computers, some requiring quite a lot of "fill these empty functions" style programming. \x[stuff-school-should-actually-teach][Education is a joke]. Anyways, this was a prelude to exactly what Ciro wanted to do in \x[ourbigbook-com].

https://webia.lip6.fr/~durrc/Iut/Notes580.pdf

Then not long afterwards, Ciro started playing with \x[linux]. Perhaps a spark of motivation came from brief interactions with university computers that had one of those mysterious sounding \x[unix] operating systems. University should be forced to use only open source software and hardware in undergrad teaching courses by law BTW.

Then came an \x[ubuntu] live disk on his own machine, and finally a measly 40GB dual book partition in a \x[microsoft-windows] machine on a laptop. At first, it took a lot of time to learn all the crazy new terminal stuff! Yes, at this point, Ubuntu was already usable enough without the terminal, an accomplishment actually. But as a programmer, Ciro felt obliged to learn. Many hours were spent reading man pages at the library. But it all just felt so right, and sometimes powerful... true wizardry.

And then to finish things off Ciro found two websites that changed his life forever, and made be believe that there was an alternative: \x[ciro-santilli-s-stack-overflow-contributions][Stack Overflow] and https://github.com/cirosantilli[GitHub].

The brutal openness of it all. The raw high quality content. Ugliness and uselessness too no doubt. But definitely spark in a sea of darkness.

= Facebook profile face dump
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-projects}

In 2016 Ciro made a script downloaded \x[facebook] profile pictures.

This was possible at the time without any login by using a 2010 profile ID dump from originally announced at: https://blog.skullsecurity.org/2010/return-of-the-facebook-snatchers since profile picture access was not authenticated.

The profile ID dump was downloadable through a \x[bittorrent] named `fbdata.torrent` of about 2.8GB, mostly compressed. Doing:
``
find . -type f | xargs sha256sum | sha256sum
``
on Ubuntu 20.04 gives:
``
2c9a739c9c5495e38ebab81fc67411b7c6562f139dcb8619901a3f01230efdd5
``
This dump widely reported e.g. on \x[hacker-news] at: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1554558[].

At some point however, Facebook finally started to require tokens to view public profile pictures, thus making such further collection impossible, e.g. as of 2021: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v9.0/user/picture[] mentions:
\Q[Querying a User ID (UID) now requires an access token.]
This is also mentioned e.g. at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11442442/get-user-profile-picture-by-id[]. This major privacy flaw was therefore finally addressed at some point, making it impossible to reproduce this project.

Ciro downloaded 10 thousand of those pictures, and did facial extraction with: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13211745/detect-face-then-autocrop-pictures/37501314#37501314

He then created single a video by joining 10 thousand of those cropped faces which can be uploaded e.g. to \x[youtube]. Ciro later decided it was better to make those videos private however, as sooner later he'd lose his account for it.

\x[company]{c}{p} like \x[youtube] blocking this kind of content is the type of thing that makes companies take longer to fix such gaping privacy issues, and is a bit like \x[security-through-obscurity]. A video makes it clear to everyone that there is a privacy issue very effectively. But people prefer to hide and look away, and then 99% of people who know nothing about tech get their privacy busted by actual criminals/government spies and never learn about it.

But now that Facebook finally fixed it, it's fine, no need for the video anymore.

= Bug reports and feature requests
{parent=always-out-of-date-and-rarely-update-list-of-open-source-contributions-by-ciro-santilli}

* I opened and was confirmed or generated considerable interest
* I wrote comments pointing out a non obvious cause/fix/duplicate.
* I reviewed the patch

This shall not list bugs solved by my accepted pull requests.

= Closed source

Disclaimer: closed source vendors tend to be highly secretive, solving small issues without any reply, so I use my best judgement given the lack of feedback.

= The missing link between basic and advanced
{parent=essays-by-ciro-santilli}

One of \x[ciro-santilli]'s strongest feeling in \x[education] is that material often falls in either of the two categories:
* hundreds of too basic \x[popular-science], e.g.:
  * a 5 minute \x[popular-science] video trying to explain \x[quantum-electrodynamics] (an advanced subject) for someone who doesn't know what a \x[riemann-integral] is (a basic subject)
* a few full university courses that takes 20 hours to deliver the first punchline of the course

Ciro believes that there is often an important missing link between them, e.g.:
* a 15 minute video that delivers the main end results and motivations for people who already know the very basic stuff

If we as a society are unable to provide this sweet \x[middle-way] sweet-spot, it is unreasonable to expect that learners will ever have the motivation to advance, because it is just too boring! They are just more likely to go play \x[video-game]{p} instead.

It is Ciro's hope that \x[ourbigbook-com] will help to fill exactly that gap.

In Ciro's view, as of the 2020's this critical gap generally lies somewhere between the end of \x[undergraduate] studies, and at the start of \x[postgraduate] studies.

What we have to do is make this knowledge more accessible all way down to high school and earlier.

Let's \x[take-the-gloves-off] more often, and give the full thing to interested students!

This problem is basically the knowledge version of the \x[last-mile-problem].

  \Q[
  There are myriad resources for physics and maths. The Kahn Academy and Patrick JMT were the best for me. They really helped me out. The question is, what resources are there for the advanced \x[undergraduate] courses?

= How to write technical help requests and bug reports
{parent=essays-by-ciro-santilli}

\x[ciro-santilli] often sees all those genius who are much smarter than him making \x[shitty] forum/mailing list posts, they need to learn this:
* The apparently most important one liner error message must appear in the title, and fuller apparently relevant logs must appear on the body
* You must always give the version of the software that you are using as either a tag or git SHA

  These are an important part of the \x[minimal-working-example].
* For build errors, you must give your OS and compiler version and version of any relevant external library

= Questions for Ciro Santilli's future self
{parent=essays-by-ciro-santilli}

Future self, answer these.

10 years:
* 2017-2027: did self-driving cars become big?
* 2017-2027: did virtual reality become big?

20 years
* 2018-2038: are \x[molecular-biology-technologies][companies offering free full genome decoding] just to get your genomic data and sell it to pharma companies?

  Someone like Ciro then creates an open source genomic database funded by health organizations that publishes genomes + phenotypes \x[anonymously]. Genome to phenotype analytics go crazy big.

40 years:
* 2017-2057: was \x[large-cohesive-game-world-for-robotic-like-artificial-intelligence-development][human level AI reached] (by non-bio devices :-)), even if very slow?
* 2017-2057: \x[ciro-santilli-s-campaign-for-freedom-of-speech-in-china][did China become democratic]?
* 2018-2058: did impressive \x[brain-computer-interface]{p} show up?

Brand on extractor glass: Elica: https://elica.com

\Q[
Aluminium extractor filter for 208298104403

Hi there,

I'm trying to buy a spare aluminium extractor filter for an Elica extractor, but I can't find the right size on the website.

My 12NC is : 208298104403

My filter looks a lot like this: https://shop.elica.com/en/accessori/filtro-grassi-in-alluminio-cod-GRI0077330A.html but the dimensions are different: I measured 45.9cm x 17.6cm on my old one.

Do you have that for sale?

2021-01: kitchen extractor right lamp burnt. Replaced with another Eveready.

2021-01: left back bulb burnt, put in another LE GU10 LED Bulbs

2020-11: kitchen extractor left lamp burnt again. Did I forget to report a right side burn earlier, or is there something wrong with the left one? Also can't find the second bulb that was likely bought last time, so likely the right one burnt and the other bulb was used for it. Buying https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00LOBUDSS "4 x Eveready 20 W 12 V G4 Dimmable Halogen Capsule Light Bulbs Pack of 4" for 3.66 pounds. Worked, felt a bit more yellow than the previous one.

2019-11: front right kitchen lamp burnt, Sylvania GU10 50W. 50W was likely some useless "incandescent equivalent" measure. Replaced: GE LED 5W 345 lumens 2700K Warm 15k hours, which looks exactly the same.

2019-05: kitchen extractor left lamp burnt. Was: DURA G4 12V20W: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Halogen-Light-Bulbs-Lamps-5watt/dp/B003IVP12A Replaced: Sainsbury's halogen G4 20W12V.

2019-01-24, right one burnt a few days ago, old Bell still works. Inner part black, and black dot on the wire. Putting new TopLux again, but this time on the left, old bell on right.

2019-01-24 toilet top lamp also burnt a few days ago, but not at the same time as mirror. Diall, 240V 40W, GU10. Putting in IKEA 240V 35W.

2019-02-02 toilet mirror lamp left (TopLux) burnt. Don't know what to do anymore. Only the magic Bell lamp works.

2019-03-06 toilet top lamp left burnt, IKEA 240V 35W GU10. Putting in another one.

2019-03-28 toilet top lamp right burnt, IKEA 240V 35W GU10. Waiting for people to come to look at transformer, there is definitely something wrong.

2019-04-03 top lamps: replaced with LED (LAP GU10 3W) since lower power, transformer not changed. Mirror lamps: transformer changed, left one replaced with Homebase Halogen 20W 12V. When I came back lamps flickering badly and sometimes not turning on, recalled technician.

2019-04-12 mirror lamp: it was just he connector that was bad, it was changed, also put LEDs there to make it less warm and hopefully have less tear on connector.

  After doing that, another update became available to: 0.1.56, clicked it and was much faster than the previous one, and didn't auto reboot. After manual reboot, `dmidecode` diffed again:

* 2021-06-05 upgraded to \x[ubuntu] 21.04 with a clean install from an ISO. Selected

  * "Erase disk and install Ubuntu". Notably, this erased the \x[microsoft-windows] that came with the computer and was never used not even once
  * "Erase disk ans use ZFS"
  * Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security
  After this, the GUI felt fast, who would have thought that erasing a bunch of stuff would make the system faster!

  Had two GUI freezes since installation, a fixed images shows no matter what I do, possibly graphics only, but impossible to tell (next time I'll try SSH access). No \x[nvidia] drivers installed yet.

2020-06-06: dropped some lemon juice on the bottom left of touchpad. Bottom left button not working anymore... I'm an idiot. There are many other alternatives, but very aggravating, I'll replace it for sure. Can't find the exact replacement part or any videos showing its replacement online easliy, dang. For the T430: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3lzV9uXRjU Asked at: https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-P-and-W-Series-Mobile-Workstations/P51-left-bottom-button-below-trackpad-mouse-left-click-stopped-working-possible-to-replace/m-p/5019903 Also I could not access it because you need to remove the HDD first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Klawxc7T_Y and I can't pull it out even with considerable force, unlike in the video... And OMG, those button caps are impossible to re-install once removed!!! Then when I put the whole thing back together, the upper buttons were not working anymore. FUUUUUUUUCK. When first opening I pulled on it without properly removing the cap and it came off, but it didn't look broken in any way and I put it back in. Keyboard works thank God, so right black connector is fine, left white one oppears to be the one for upper keys and trackpoint, both of which stopped working. The hardware manual confirms that they are both part of the same device, so basically a mouse :-) TODO can it be bought separately from te keyboard? Doesn't look like it, photo of keyboard part includes those buttons. The manual also confirms that the bottom buttons are one device with the trackpad "trackpad with buttons", thus forming the second entire mouse.

2021-11: seatpost making noises again... going to try a Brand-X Layback Seatpost, which does not have the useless suspension, and has a double bolt system, and sells on wiggle which is a good sign.

2021-11: 3 days after a ride, tire was empty, thought it was vandalism. Inspected, could not see any issues, did a 75km ride, and left a gain, and again it lost air quickly. Opened up tire, and found a thorn of some plant pierced inside, almost invisible from the outside. It also feels like the thorn stuck in place and reduced the rate of air loss, after removing the tube it lost air quite quickly. Could not fully remove thorn, can still feel it with my finger, but too well stuck in tire, but I don't think it is enough to piere again, I just put a patch set on top of it, and new tube Schwalbe 700C 28'' AV 17, got two of those.

2021-11: trickling noise coming from front wheel. Going to get a new one without the generator which I have use anyways and see if it solves it: https://www.tredz.co.uk/.M-Part-Shimano-Deore-Hub-on-Mavic-A319-700c-Rim-Complete-Wheel_35638.htm M Part Shimano Deore Hub On Mavic A319 700c Rim Complete Wheel.

2021-10: changed chain for new one. Found out that the one I bought did not have a quicklink... Also, it did not come in the original package, but in a sealed plastic bag, presumably to reduce shipping costs. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XVQ2O0 have to be more careful next time. Lost the Shimano 500ml bottle, was strapped on back carrier of bike, but not safe enough, and I went through rough terrain. Had seen it fall off once before another time, but very rare. When I noticed, had no idea where it had fallen off and didn't go back for it. Buying:
* https://www.topeak.com/global/en/products/245-Accessories/1093-VERSAMOUNT Topeak Versamount bottle cage mount because this frame only has 1 pair of holes, why...

* https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002FOMU3O Science in Sport Clear Drinks Bottle, 800 ml, Transparent, possible official: https://www.wiggle.co.uk/science-in-sport-800ml-water-bottle
Fit perfectly. Luckily \x[amazon] made me buy two Versamounts, because I needed to use one for each bottle, as the holes on the frame were too close to the bottom and made it impossible to fit both otherwise.

2021-09-05: chain reached 0.75, rebuying HG40 8. Also buying second set of break pads, front is gone, and back almost, gonna swap both at once.

2021-08: back side of teeth of seat post wore off, and the seat is rotating vertically. Identification: markings: ELC (maybe middle letter worn off). 27.2 diameter / 350, 350 is the length from Googling. Has a simple shock absorber system and a single pin to attach the seat. OK, something very similar or the same: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N9ZTD22[]. BESNIN Suspension seatpost. Full markings are: HARD MDU INSIDE under seat clamp, these match exactly. Tube markings are a bit different.

2021-08: noticed that there was a stone stuck inside back tire. Luckily didn't puncture. TODO was it in the same place as the previous puncture? Not far from Schwalbe mark. Rebuying... and answering https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/9827/when-should-you-replace-tires-after-getting-a-flat Going to buy Shoe Goo as well to see if it works: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Shoe-Goo-Crystal-Permanent-Adhesive/dp/B08P5V9GQV

2021-08-12: after putting new chain on, if I step hard on pedal on 6th gear, by far the most used, it skips. Seems to be the same symptom as 2020-12 when cassette was worn off, as the shifting itself seems fine. https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/8378/difference-between-shimano-hg51-8-speed-cassette-and-shimano-hg50-8-speed-casset says hg51 is compatible, so getting that newer model. 11-34t was much more expensive/less common than 11-32, so getting 11-32. Managed to install it without any problems.

2021-08: bought Shimano HG40 8 speed chain and put it on bike

2021-07:
* rear shift cable snapped inside shifter during rid, same as 2020-10, same symptom that could never index higher tension gears well bought new cable
* chain reached 0.75+
* trie to put front mudgard on, but several problems on this one. The screws needed are wider than those that come. Could keep old ones. But then on top of that, the wires are too long and would need cutting, so keeping the old front mudgard for now, which is working perfectly.

2021-06: Castelli UPF 50+ Light Arm Sleeves (Skins) Large White, 29 \x[pound]{p} https://www.castelli-cycling.com/bg/upf-50-+-light-arm-sleeves/p/451603621P-001[]. Felt really good. Really does not trap much heat, and completely blocks off sun. It makes you develop a small layer of sweat that keeps you cool, cooler than without the sleeves.

2021-06-05: finally removed the old bottom bracket and installed installed the one I had bought a few months back. What triggered this was the clicking noise back again. It appears that the noise got louder with the heat. The clicking noise went away after changing the new bottom bracket. The old bracket seemed fine after inspecting it closely after removal. There was a bit of dirt/earth inside, and some small chippings came out of one side, not sure if from BB or from the frame itself. There are still some other much less loud noises left however, but they are likely a different source, and not a big issue. The clicking noise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXBdPg1LhQU

2021-05: got the first flat tire ever on the back wheel! A perfectly shaped pointed triangular rock slotted perfectly into the thread and managed to perforate the inner tube. Managed to patch it up perfectly on the road, 2 hours away from home! The inside of the tire is basically intact, so I'm going to keep using it. The next day I put back an old intact inner tube I had replaced preemptively earlier on with this new one that was punctured.

2021-04: put on the Bluemels mudgard on the back. It wasn't hard, and their system seems quite easy to adjust. Chain reached 1.0 stretch, gotta get a new one.

2021-03: clicking noise when pedalling strong driving me crazy. Likely bottom bracket: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/41149/something-clicks-while-pedaling or maybe pedal. Re-buying the exact same Shimano BB-UN55 Bottom Bracket - Silver, 68-118: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/224364037969

* I can't take the cassette out anymore again, even though I put it on myself, and the day I put it on, I took it off once to check if I could, so rebuying Shimano Claris CS-HG50-8 11-34t https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/2252255352[], and if I ever have to take the old one off, I'll take it to the store again
* the tire on the old wheel was on the reverse direction, had been ridden for a very long time like that, and the threads are extremely worn
* after making insane efforts earlier to put the tire on the wheel, and knowing about directionality, when I actually took it down I noticed I had at some point of my suffering swapped sides and put it on the wrong way in......
* I weighted the wheel for fun, assembled with unfilled tire and without the cassette was about 2.5kg

2021-01: ETC Rim Tape 700 40C for the new wheel. No packaging, but possibly: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0063HIIOY

2021-01: moved the saddle forward a bit to 1.8cm was still feeling scapulas before, now seems perfect. Not much effort on hamstrings, but I don't know how to fix both, and not having pain is more important

2020-12: moved the saddle forward back to 2cm, was feeling too much pressure on lower back, and on previous ride, the most tired part of body was behind scapulas, so presumably due to overreach. Felt immediately better.

2020-12-22: felt like rear hub had a bit of friction, can't fix vibration, going to try the buying a new whole wheel:
* https://www.bikeparts.co.uk/products/m-part-shimano-deore-mavic-a319-silver-dt-swiss-p-g-36-hole-rear-wheel Found by Googling same rim as original "Mavic A319". Site markings: WLC503 M PART SHIMANO DEORE / MAVIC A319 SILVER / DT SWISS P/G 36 HOLE 700C HYBRID REAR WHEEL. Cannot find a single website that gives exact rear hub model, but hopefully Deore will match, looks the same. 70 pounds. Does not come with rim tape.
* Schwalbe Men's Marathon Plus Tour Hs404 Performance Line Rigid Tires Size: 700 x 40C. Just going to get the entire thing to have leave a backup wheel.

2020-12-21: put in the new cassette, chainring and chain. Shifting is amazing once again. When pedalling strong on the test run it felt like something on the back hub was vibrating... gotta debug that. Maybe not enough force on closing the cassette?

2020-12-20: tried to replace entire drive chain after over stretched chain destroyed teeth. Chainring and pedals came off nicely, but cassette was stuck, but I took it to the shop and they managed: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/18465/how-can-i-remove-a-stuck-rear-cassette/74041#74041

2020-12: moved saddle back to 2.5cm mark to try and get more hamstring action, but back started hurting. Moved to 2.2cm half way through ride, and it seemed perfect.

2020-12: moved seat post down after https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNGMRtJ5LIc mentioned that saddle too high causes greater asymmetries which I had felt. With \x[dhb-dorica-mtb-shoe-2020-12] with cleats straight on 2-mark. First down 15mm from max, but felt really too low. Then down only 7.5mm, and felt great, possibly better than before.

2020-12: moved \x[2020-04-giro-rumble-vr-off-road-shoe] cleats all the way back, and turned the left one a bit outward to better fit let. Got more tired on hamstrings than on quads now, gotta improve that later on maybe for better balance.

2020-12: put more WD-40 on front shifter. Let it dry, then "WD-40 Bike, All Conditions Lube Bicycle". After next four hour ride, shift to 3rd was still working perfectly. Found the culprit.

Put back the rear mudguard. Wheel not hitting it for now. Lost the extra appended protector thingy, was sure I saw it during installation, so maybe it just fell off during next ride? Can't find it at home. Does not make much different for me, might help others behind me though.

2020-12-05: 4 hour ride, very wet and dirty, on start could get into third perfectly, but at end couldn't anymore!!! So it must have been an issue with lubrication on the bottom shift mechanism.

2020-12-01:
* test rode 3rd gear shift, completely smooth now!
* put back the new saddle Selle Royal Scientia, and inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX3fKolI25Q moved the saddle to 2cm position because I had never felt my hamstrings. It did feel much better! I felt my hamstrigs more, and butt took much longer to get soggy, maybe only around 2 hour mark! Started feeling lower back more though.

2020-11-30:
* fixed the can't get into 3rd gear problem. Did the following:
  * without cable tension, it changed easily
  * sprayed HD40 on shifter and hinges near bottom bracket
  * still didn't shift
  * reduced tension. This made me manage to change to the 3rd. It must be highlighted how sensitive this was to tension. 5 quarter screws on the shifter barrel were the difference between being able to shift or not
  * one more thing Ciro noticed, is that he had possibly previously held up the front gear before attaching the cable, therefore possibly overly tensioning it. It might be better to just instead pull the end of the cable with a pair of pliers to remove slack, but wihtout making the gear move up, that is enough. Then finish tuning on the shifter arrel adjuster
  * then since everyting was out and ready, also changed shift cable just in case. The new one had a bit less friction, but not a lot less, so it did not feel like it was what solved the problem
* also better inspected the chainrings. Middle one is visibly worn due to the century old chain, even more so than the teeth of the cassettes on the back.. so here we go again, more Shimano FC-M311: https://www.bikeparts.co.uk/products/shimano-fc-m311-altus-square-taper-chainset-48-38-28t-with-chainguard-175-mm Can't find how to buy just chainring itself.

2020-11-28: can't stand slippage anymore, going to change cassette too, rebuying Shimano Claris CS-HG50-8 11-34t: https://www.ebay.co.uk/p/2252255352 20 pounds

2020-11-26: left hand large gear almost impossibly hard to switch to largest gear. The gear switches on chainring, but it won't click and stay in place, related: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/46172/front-shifter-wont-shift-into-3rd

2020-11-22: put back old saddle, one inch from back, did 6 hour ride, it is more comfortable than new one. Butt was soggy at some points, but much less than new saddle.

2020-11-19: noticed that chain slips if I pedal very strongly, and especially if I try to stand up: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/7928/why-does-my-gear-slip-when-going-uphill-standing Does not happen on the largest chainring. Have to check the smallest one, as it is harder to check there. Took to shop, they said chain worn out with tool measurement, and cassette worn out.

Bought Shimano CN-HG71 8 speed chain 19 pounds, with quicklink: https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/city---trekking-e-bike-e6100-series/CN-HG71.html | https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/city---trekking-e-bike-e6100-series/CN-HG71.html[], it is from the \x[shimano-product-lines][Acera line]. The price in-store was good, on \x[amazon-company] Prime, would have been 27 pounds! https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00JJWR12U There were two chain options, a cheaper 12 pound one, and the more expensive. TODO difference? Maybe the cheap one is https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/tourney/CN-HG40.html[CN-HG40], which is from the Tourney line?

I inspected the cassette myself later on, but it did not appear significantly worn out in my newbie opinion.

2020-11-08: used \x[park-tool-paw-12-adjustable-wrench] and \x[park-tool-bbt-22] to remove bottom bracket to debug noise. After putting everything together, it seemed gone on a very short test ride. The bottom bracket itself seemed fine. There was a bit of dirt, but didn't seem critical. What felt more off was that the drive side cranck arm came off much more easily than the non-drive side one, suggesting it was not tight enough. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPQyQnNdews "Crank Removal and Installation - Three Piece Crankset (Square Spindle, ISIS, Octalink)" by Park Tool (2015) suggests that this is a common cause of noise, so maybe removing the bottom bracket wasn't needed after all this time. But it's done at least.

2020-11-05
* moved saddle backwards a bit to 1 cm mark, was feeling like butt was falling off the back a bit at 0 cm. After this, it felt better, but still a bit mushy after 4 hour ride
* been hearing a clicking noise when pedalling, left foot at about 7 o'clock. Going to open it up.

2020-10-04 bought a new inner shift cable for the rear derailleur from bike shop, bulk without visible branding. The plastic shifter casing screw was stripped, could not get it off. OMG I had done that just yesterday on the road for the diagnosis! How is it possible? So soft!!!! I just proped the plastic open with a flat screw driver and managed to insert the cable. However, the previous problem still remains: I can't get smooth shift to faster gears on the rear.

2020-10-03 was having rear shifting issues for a while, and today it stopped working completely. Opened and noticed that the shift cable had ruptured inside the shifter!!! Related: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/40536/shifter-cable-broke-down-misuse-lack-of-maintenance-shifter-or-regular-occurr This has been only 11 months since last change.

2020-08: buying Selle Royal Scientia M2 saddle: https://www.selleroyal.com/en/scientia-m-2 based on 60 degree riding position and 110mm sitbone distance \x[ciro-santilli-s-body]. Had felt a little bit of pain on butt muscle but it passed. But also noticed that the UNICLO shorts ripped a bit, and it might be due to the terrible state of the saddle. Felt good on first ride around the block. Harder than previous, and narrower. Feels higher quality and better fitting.

2020-06-06: replaced front brake pads with the Jagire ones previously bought (one pair already been put on rear brakes)

2020-04-19: tried to remove left pedal again with \x[2020-04-decareta-pedal-spanner], put more force, and the tool itself actually got dented and started spinning freely around the pedal. I give up, will change crank arm. Can't find just the left crank arm, and not sure if 170/175, so just buying the entire thing: Shimano Altus FC-M311 Crank set 48T/38T/28T with chaingard: https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/si/SI-0094A-001-ENG.pdf | https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/ev/EV-FC-M311-2675A.pdf | https://www.deporvillage.net/shimano-altus-m311-175mm-78-speed-chain-set-483828-black at 175mm which is the correct one for my height as mentioned at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUygkHlcVMQ

2020-04: bought Shimano Deore PD-M324 pedals in preparation for flat to SPD switch: https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/deore-t6000/PD-M324.html[] (https://web.archive.org/web/20200419105148/https://bike.shimano.com/en-EU/product/component/deore-t6000/PD-M324.html[archive]) | https://www.wiggle.co.uk/shimano-m324-combination-pedals[], since I'll remove the pedals at somepoint anyways, first learnt at: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/30662/can-i-use-normal-shoes-trainers-with-clipless-pedals/30720#30720 can be used with normal shoes too. SPD/plataform double side chosen to so I can both commute with on regular shoes and ride further for sport with SPD shoes. Cleat type: SM-SH56. Praying to God that the thread size is universal as mentioned at: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/10162/whats-difference-between-1-2-and-9-16-inch-pedals When they arrived noticed they felt quite heavy! 533g. Let's see. The non double sided is 455g though: https://www.wiggle.co.uk/shimano-m530-mtb-spd-trail-pedals/[]. And a full roadie one like PD-RS500 SPD-SL weights 320g.

2020-04: attempted to use \x[2020-04-decareta-pedal-spanner] to remove left pedal that would not come off with generic short wrench and has been ticking a bit for several months, and now sometimes appears to do false spins! The think must be completely destroyed. Failed, too hard.

2020-04: was trying to remove left pedal with short wrench I had, impossible. Later noticed that the kick up stand was a bit bent! Tried to turn it around, but did not manage to make it improve much. Later during a ride, the new position was too close to the spokes, and started to hit the spokes! When I got home, tried to remove the \x[fucking] kickstand, but it had a flat bolt in a deep place between the rear tubes, and I couldn't do it with my simple wrenches. Went to bike shop next day, and they removed it, likely with a deep wrench. The piece was thrown away.

2020-03: finally installed the new derailleur after long suffering, including new cables and casing on front and back derailleurs and on back brake. Took 3 1-2 hour sessions, but it became amazing.

2020-03: screw on left shifter (yes, the bloody screw) broke when trying to open it to take out cable. Buying left and right since the right one was broken from previous fall. https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B073XQ8J78 SHIMANO ST-EF65-8 EZI FIRE STI SHIFTERS 24 SPEED (3 x 8), 25 pounds https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/ev/EV-ST-EF65-9R4-3257B.pdf

2020-01-13: Parked on city center, shitty low diagonal place, crowded. When came back, bike on floor, had dropped hard since front wheel twisted on axis, untwisted with leg. When got home, noticed that right gear shifter was half coming off. Later found out that the piece broken on one of the screws, hanging only by the other screw. Next day morning, noticed that the bell had come off, and was lost, went back on evening but obviously could not find it.

Frame markings: Trekking (two stylized trees on left, one with two triangles and the other 3 triangles), Frame Size: M. Feels more or less the right size for me. Maybe L would be better, as my butt tends to go off the back of the saddle, which I always cranck to the most backward position possible.

There are two possible tooth counts, I counted 48T on largest, so it is the 48/38/28 one. There are two arm sizes though, 170mm vs 175mm, not sure which one mine is, very hard to measure, I think it was 170mm.

2022-02: bought a Trelock BC 115/110/4 chain white for my saddle after \x[liv-flourish-2-2018] the saddle of was stolen at home. Same as this but white: https://www.trelock.com/en/lock/locks/chain-locks/bc-115-110-4-green[]. The keys are a bit larger than I'd like.

2021-11: buying a Cateye ViZ450 https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/safety_lights/TL-LD820/ 51 dollars after CatEye RAPID X2 was stolen. Unfortunately, it is not very compatible with my Topeak saddle bag... the attachment is to wide to fit the saddble bag, and even if it did it is slanted to account for seat tube slant so it would not be very verfical. Arghh, they have futher options on the website: https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/parts/5342460/ that is the one I need, Clip C-2 or Clip C-1N. On Amazon it didn't have clear choices for that... mine came with the BracketSP-15. Ah, can buy on Amazon for 3 dollars, OK then.

2021-11: COZYROOMY multitool broke apart already, like before, but much sooner this time. What a piece of junk!!! Buying the Topeak Mini 18+ Bike Multitool https://www.topeak.com/global/en/products/75-Mini-Tools/173-mini-18+

2021-09: COZYROOMY multitool stolen, even though it was completely in pieces already. 2021-09-21 12:30PM discovered, seat bag open, one tool on floor, and some leftovers inside, but black bag gone. Bicycle last seen 2021-09-20 6PM. Would likely have spotted it if it had happened before. Bicycle last used: 2021-09-19 6PM. Would almost for sure have seen it if it had happened by then. Rebought it.

No spoke wrench unfortunately. But does have 15mm bone wrench, which opens Kross front wheel. Some months later, the thing came apart, quality was a bit shit. But I kept it in the saddle bag anyways for a long time, and just used it by putting part of it manually together.

2019-11: "CatEye RAPID X2" real lights, 40 dollars. Hopefully to increase side visibility at night, and day visibility on fast roads when cycling further on weekends. https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/safety_lights/TL-LD710-R/ (https://web.archive.org/web/20180904083218/https://www.cateye.com/intl/products/safety_lights/TL-LD710-R/[archive]) USB rechargeable. 80 lumens in high mode lasting 1 hour, 5 hours in low mode, 30 hours flashing, 16 hours rapid/pulse. Lost 2021-11 in a big city, didn't know the path well, had to cross a bunch of streets, was on back of back bag, likely stolen.

I glued it with some superglue, but two months later found it leaked into my "oils bag", so I threw it away... it must have penetrated through the super glue.

2019-08: "CatEye CA475RAPMIN Rapid Mini Rear Lights and Reflectors, Black" stolen: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01I4193PY (https://web.archive.org/web/20190829232804/https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01I4193PY[archive]). Very good quality. Those USB rechargeable lights you just have got to take off with you whenever parked in town or else \x[drug-addict]{p} will steal them because they are easy to remove for recharging. Tempted to just stick to dynamo ones that are screwed in. Re-bought original back light: AXA Basta, was a bit different from previous one, cannot take in lamps anymore, even though there is the plastic casing for them! Just not metal / wires.

2021-01: "Endura FS260-NEMO Glove II" Neoprene Winter Handwarmer Large. https://www.endurasport.com/Gants-Nemo-FS260-Pro-II/p/E1216-Black Let's see how neoprene feels like. Basically it becomes wet with your transpiration, but is still relatively warm, would take it well down to 5C. Likely would work well with heavy \x[rain]. Not bad. But does feel a bit cooler than the Extremities XDRY, especially after you walk for a bit, and your hand becomes cold, and it is very hard to warm it because it is also wet.

2020-12-21: "dhb Neoprene Nylon Overshoes" https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-neoprene-nylon-overshoes large black. After 2 rides, noticed that the front lower part of left foot (the one I put on and off the most) had a hole in it, not sure where it was made. Edit: I later noticed that it is because I have the reflex of braking slightly with my shoes in certain conditions, e.g. at lower speeds in close proximity to pedestrians, the sounds of which also serve as a way to alert them without the need for a loud bell. But it destroys the overshoe, so I have to undo that reflex.

2020-11-06 https://www.alpinetrek.co.uk/castelli-perfetto-ros-long-sleeve-cycling-jersey/ "Castelli Perfetto RoS Long Sleeve - Cycling jersey" size L Large. On Wiggle: https://www.wiggle.co.uk/castelli-perfetto-ros-long-sleeve-jersey Feels great. Together with the dhb Merino Long Sleeve Base Layer, I can gown down to 0 Celcius, no problem. Breathes great, blocks wind and rain reasonably, and can holds mild rain out on a short 1.5h ride without problem.

2020-10-17:
* last ride top was a bit cold on shoulders where not covered by arm warmers, about 10C, so going to try: https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-aeron-rain-defence-polartec-jacket-1 "dhb Aeron All Winter Softshell Jacket", 109.25 pounds, Fluro Yellow, small to match previous tops that worked, approx: 50 polyester, 40 polyamide, 10 elastane, recommended temperature: 2-12 degrees Celcius. Material felt OK, not amazing but OK. Returned because a bit too small.
* the "dhb Classic Thermal Bib Tights" is a bit too warm for lower tens, so going to try "dhb Aeron FLT Roubaix Bib Tight", 85.50 pounds, medium, navy color, recommended temperatures:  6-14 deg C, 84% polyamide, 16% elastane. Hopefully not being marked as "thermal" means it is less warm. Also hopefully being DHB Aeron it will be a bit less baggy behind knees. Returned later because felt indistinguishable from the "dhb Classic Thermal Bib Tights".

For sizing see also: \x[ciro-santilli-s-body].

2020-11: Castelli Thermoflex 2 Arm Warmers, Large, 28 pounds: https://www.wiggle.co.uk/castelli-thermoflex-2-arm-warmers | https://www.castelli-cycling.com/gb/men/accessories/cycling-leg-and-arm-warmers/p/451953020A-010 advertized 8°-20°C. Was going to buy the DHB ones for 10 pounds less, but always out of so Castelli it is.

2020-08: started getting getting cold, so let's do it:
* https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-lightweight-mesh-long-sleeve-base-layer "dhb Lightweight Mesh Long Sleeve Base Layer", small, 93% polyester 7% Elastane. Felt a little bit tight on first try, but I think I'll keep it, it might be correct, it's hard to say, and it's not worth my time. If it is too bad I'll just get another one later.

  Extremely light and transparent. Holds down to lower 10's, but if it's windy a bit less so. Feels good.
* https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-classic-thermal-bib-tights "dhb Classic Thermal Bib Tights", medium, 86% polyamide, 14% elastane, 56 pounds. Very slightly tight, but felt right on first try. Some similar URLs https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-classic-thermal-bib-tights-1 | https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-thermal-bib-tight

  Pretty warm, for lower 10's and under only. Mid 10's is too much. Slightly bulky behind the knees when you bend. But good quality otherwise.
* https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-extreme-weather-neoprene-overshoe "dhb Extreme Weather Neoprene Overshoe", large, 81% polyamide, 18% polyurethane. Wanted to buy https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-neoprene-nylon-overshoes which is lighter, but was out of stock. The material felt good, but it did not fit with \x[2020-04-giro-rumble-vr-off-road-shoe], I should have checked better, maybe it is only for road shoes.

  Incompatible with \x[2020-04-giro-rumble-vr-off-road-shoe], so returned it. That shoe is too large.

2020-05 https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-aeron-short-sleeve-jersey-4/ dhb Aeron Short Sleeve Jersey 100% polyester, Red Large. This one fit OK. Length feels right. When on cycling position, a bit baggy under arms though, but guessing M would be too short? Still already feels less baggy than the cheap muddy fox jersey. Aeron is the second lowest level of DHB top, after the super basic 25 pound one. Material is thin polyester, could be better, but OK.

2020-05 https://www.wiggle.co.uk/castelli-perfetto-light-2-short-sleeve-jersey/ Castelli Perfetto Light 2 Short Sleeve Jersey 84% Nylon, 16% Lycra. When it arrived, was WAY too small, so returned. Material looked and felt amazing.

2019-12 https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-merino-long-sleeve-base-layer-1/?sku=5360752872 "dhb Merino Long Sleeve Base Layer", black, small, was right size, wool is a bit itchy, but does feel like it dries off more quickly on long rides than the cheap Muddy Fox polyester cycling Jersey. Pretty warm, too much for 15C.

Grey color, red inner butt padding. 2020-08: after using it a lot, noticed that the padding stiches started to come off a bit.

2018 (?) Extremities XDRY gloves Looks like: https://www.sportsdirect.com/extremities-wp-p/line-glove-91-907293 (https://web.archive.org/web/20200419133931/https://www.sportsdirect.com/extremities-wp-p/line-glove-91-907293[archive]) Gets wet after a few minutes of medium \x[rain]. But does dry quickly. Baggy, multilayer. Says 40 pounds, but always at 20 pound discount, so it is just a marketing trick.

= dhb Dorica MTB Shoe (2020-12)
{parent=cycling-clothes}

https://www.wiggle.co.uk/dhb-dorica-mtb-shoe

Black EUR 44, 1 smaller than \x[ciro-santilli-s-body][normal size] as recommended by website.

Bought SM-SH56 cleat to accompany.

When it arrived, it felt a bit too long, around 2cm maybe free space after toe, and when I walk and the front part touches ground, heel comes off a bit, which is annoying. But I was too lazy to give it back and take the risk of a second try, also it felt correctly tight on sides. During first test ride it felt good.

It is slightly water proof. But if it rains a lot, it will get soaking wet. And once it does get wet, it feels like it is very very hard to dry, there don't seem to be any holes underneath.

= 2020-04 Giro Rumble VR Off Road Shoe
{parent=cycling-clothes}

2021-01-28: used this show for th first time after wearing \x[dhb-dorica-mtb-shoe-2020-12] exclusively for a while. It felt much much more comfortable, the Dorica is too narrow. Also this one is much more recessed, and walking with it is much easier. Also, I notice that the intentional asymmetry I had put on cleats is not necessary anymore now that my saddle height is not way too high

At 5C feet are too cold. Compatible overshoes are basically impossible to find: https://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/73589/what-kind-of-overshoes-can-i-use-with-a-large-touring-spd-cycling-shoe-such-as-t

It is not possible to do long walks with this, unlike some websites suggests, especially on hard surfaces like rock, that would be very dangerous because the cleat area will slip. But it is good for shorter walks on grass/mud, and that does open up some good short walk exploration possibilities compared to a road shoe.

Color "Black/Red 20" (but it's actually orange), size 46 https://www.wiggle.co.uk/giro-rumble-vr-off-road-shoe (https://web.archive.org/web/20180816224711/https://www.wiggle.co.uk/giro-rumble-vr-off-road-shoe[archive]). Manual says to use Loctite 243 medium strength, first 2.4 Nm bolt torque to test it out and find good position, and then final bolt torque 5-6 Nm unless cleat says less. Starting with Shimano SM-SH56 cleats (https://si.shimano.com/pdfs/si/SI-41R0G-003-ENG.pdf[archive]), which also says provisional torque 2.5 Nm, tightening torque 5-6 Nm.

= Roast chicken
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-cooking}

2020-12: large-ish chicken, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJeUb8ToRIw worked very well. Just that after 1 hour it was slightly uncooked in the middle, and 10 minutes later, the top skin burnt a little bit. So next time, use some \x[aluminium] foil.

= Roasted nuts
{parent=ciro-santilli-s-cooking}

All with olive oil and salt mixed up before roasting.

2021-04-05 180C:
* chestnuts: 1.5x 200g: 3x 6min, this was a bit too much
* hazelnuts: 1.5x 200g: 3x 6min, seemed fine
* pecans: 4.5x 200g bags: 5x 6 min, a bit uneven roast because too much on tray

2021-02-06 180C:
* almonds: 2x 200g: 3x 6min, slighted burnt taste
* Brazil nuts: 2x 300g: 3x 6min + 3min
* chestnuts: 1x 400g: 3x 6min, perfect
* pecans: 3x 200g bags (previously had done just 2 bags at a time): 3x 6 min + 2x 3min, perfect

2021-01-04:
* almonds: 190C, 8 min, they started burning on top! What? I put olive oil abundantly this time. 170C 5 min
* chestnuts: 180C, 6 min, stir, 6 min, stir, 4 min, they became very good, dark brown
* pecans: 180C, 6 min, stir, 6 min, stir, 3 min while preparing chestnuts, very good

2020-11-21:
* mixed nuts: 180C, 10 minutes, did not reach the point. Then 7 more minutes on 190C: pecans completely burned out
* almonds: 190C, about 25 minutes, opened several times, in the end had a slight burnt taste, but did not get black, just darker brown. Not as crispy as the ones we buy roasted, but pretty good
* pecans: 180C, 13 minutes, opened 3 times to stir, became great
