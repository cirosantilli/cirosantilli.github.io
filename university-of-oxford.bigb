Things actually have gotten more and more closed, e.g. of stuff getting paywalled with time:
* not paywalled in 2017: https://web.archive.org/web/20170907092044/http://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/students/course-materials/c3-condensed-matter-major-option

It appears that things got really bad starting in 2017, possibly when <WebLearn (Oxford)> was introduced. When things migrated to <Canvas (Oxford)>, they were closed by default, apparently with any mechanism to publish publicly.

Therefore, they managed to make things more closed than when teachers would just upload to good old `ox.ac.uk/~name` static websites!!

<Ciro Santilli> has also heard that some people in the <Mathematical institute of the University of Oxford> opposed to moving away from their <Moodle> instance precisely because the new options did not support open publishing, so kudos to those people. But most teachers likely don't care and just do whatever is the best internally supported default.

Their "open" video material: http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/ A somewhat small part is <Creative Commons>, but most proprietary. Despite the name "podcasts", they do contain video, it is just a relic.

http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/open contains actual <Creative Commons> only it seems.

It does however appear that professors own their lecture notes, so there some hope maybe: https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/legislation/statute-xvi-property-contracts-and-trusts#collapse1383636

Has a mixture of <open access> and closed access. But at least it can have open access unlike the in-house systems such as <Canvas (Oxford)>! Sometimes things appear open but don't show any meaningful content if you are not logged in, which is annoying.

But at least it gives a clear public course list, thing that certain departments (cough <Department of physics of the University of Oxford> cough).

The organization is a bit crap, when you expand e.g. C <Michaelmas term> it shows nothing, just a search.

The way to go is via the year categories: https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/index.php?categoryid=734[]. Term splitting is annoying, but one can stand it.

{synonym}
{title2}

As of 2022:
* https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/fees-funding/fees/rates gives study fees. Almost all courses are about 9k pounds / academic year. Courses take minimum 3 years, with an optional 4th year masters. The costs of masters can be higher however, though most aren't much.

  It is funny to note how Public Policy is comically priced at 45,890 for a course without laboratories, how can a country be so corrupt? :-) It was later brought to Ciro's attention that the reason is that those courses are not usually paid by individuals, but by their employers...

  Another eye popping one is Mathematical & Computational Finance MSc for Â£36,370.
* https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/fees-funding/living-costs gives living costs, an average 12k for the usual 9 month period
* there is the Crankstart scholarship: https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/student-life/help-with-the-cost/crankstart-scholarships which gives 5k/year to students whose families have less than 27k/year income, and values decrease from there to 60k/year income where they become zero.

  It is funny to note that the scholarship was previously named after a Welsh billionaire who studied there and donated and his wife, <Michael Moritz> and wife Harriet Heyman. It is actually the Welsh who are creating those scholarships for the English! It is so funny to see. His background is quite amazing, from historian to journalist to venture capitalist.

  It was later renamed Crankstart after the <Crankstart Foundation>, presumably to help gather funds from others, but it is just still led by Michael.

  It does appear that most/all of the <natural sciences> ones are reasonably priced, perhaps they are subsided.

The median household income at the time was 31khttps://web.archive.org/web/20210909201931/https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2020provisional{ref}. Clearly, putting one child through university with that income would be basically impossible, you would pay 19 - 5 = 14k/year, almost half of your income. Two children would be impossible. Remember how each family needs to have two children minimum to perpetuate life?

\Video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uol4V1Wa8B0]
{title=History of Oxford University by Chris Day (2018)}
{description=
A large part of the video talks about how the insane system of <colleges of the University of Oxford> came about organically.
* https://youtu.be/uol4V1Wa8B0?t=343 at the <University of Bologna>, the original system was for students to decide what they would learn, and hire and fire teachers as they decided. This is opposed to the system of the <university of Paris>, in which teachers make the final decisions. He mentions that this is the system that the <University of Oxford> and the <University of Cambridge> use: the "congregation". He mentions that <Oxbridge> are one of the few universities that maintained this structure (as opposed to having funding sources select the final decision makers)
* https://youtu.be/uol4V1Wa8B0?t=1327 mentions the quadrangle architecture which served as the basis of the Colleges: make a closed square with everything students need: Chapel, Hall to eat, classes and accommodation. This is based of course on monastic cloisters.

{parent=University of Oxford}
{tag=Collegiate university}
{wiki}

A good explanation of how this insane system came up is given at <video History of Oxford University by Chris Day (2018)>.

As if it weren't enough, there are also the 6 Halls: <permanent private hall>.

The colleges are controlled by its fellows, a small self-electing body of highly successful scholars, usually in the dozens per college number it seems. Each college also usually has different types of fellows, e.g. see he university college page: https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk/about/college-fellowships/ (https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://www.univ.ox.ac.uk/about/college-fellowships/[archive])

The college system does has its merits though, as it instates a certain sense of "belonging" to a certain group, so it might help students get better support for their learning projects from older students, or through the tutoring system. Of course, all such "belonging" feelings are bad, the correct thing would be to make great online tutorials for all, and answer questions in the open. But oh well, humans are dumb.

This functionality is somewhat related to <fraternities and sororities> in 2000's <United States>.

For students (who are paying for the university to start with...), they will not claim tutorials linked to courses.

For faculty, the university owns everything it seems, to be confirmed.

Group of students that represent students academic views about the courses.

They have a list of notes of the entire course by ancient student Toby Adkins: https://pjcc.physics.ox.ac.uk/resources/notes/ but they are closed, i.e. require you to be in the oxford network, though not necessarily with an Oxford login. As of 2023, he was doing a postdoc: https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/adkins in <fusion energy>.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ewart[]. He actually fought not to be dismissed by age and won!
* https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/ewart
But as of 2023 marked emeritus, so who took over?

Ewart is actually religious:

2011- professor: <Steven H. Simon>. His start date is given e.g. at: http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/SteveSimon/condmat2012/LectureNotes2012.pdf which is presumably an older version of: http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/SteveSimon/QCM2022/QuantumMatter.pdf

Notes/book: http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/SteveSimon/QCM2022/QuantumMatter.pdf Marked as being for <Oxford MMathPhys>, so it appears that this is a 4th year course normally. TODO but where is it listed under the course list of MMapthPhys? https://mmathphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/course-schedule
