The only perfect cryptosystem!

The problem is that you need a shared \x[key-cryptography] as large as the message.

Systems like \x[advanced-encryption-standard] allow us to encrypt things larger than the key, but the tradeoff is that they could be possibly broken, as don't have any \x[provably-secure-symmetric-key-algorithm]{p} as of 2020.

Based on the fact that we don't have a \x[p-complexity] algorithm for \x[integer-factorization] as of 2020. But nor proof that one does not exist!

The private key is made of two randomly generated prime numbers: $p$ and $q$. How such large primes are found: \x[how-large-primes-are-found-for-rsa].

The public key is made of:
* `n = p*q`
* a randomly chosen integer exponent $e$ between `1` and `e_max = lcm(p -1, q -1)`, where `lcm` is the \x[least-common-multiple]

Given a plaintext message `m`, the encrypted cyphertext version is:
``
c = m^e mod n
``
This operation is called \x[modular-exponentiation] can be calculated efficiently with the \x[extended-euclidean-algorithm].

The inverse operation of finding the private `m` from the public `c`, `e` and $n$ is however believed to be a hard problem without knowing the factors of `n`.

However, if we know the private `p` and `q`, we can solve the problem. As follows.

First we calculate the \x[modular-multiplicative-inverse]. TODO continue.

Answers suggest hat you basically pick a random large odd number, and add 2 to it until your selected \x[primality-test] passes.

The \x[prime-number-theorem] tells us that the probability that a number between 1 and $N$ is a prime number is $1/log(N)$.

Therefore, for an N-bit integer, we only have to run the test N times on average to find a prime.

Since say, A 512-bit integer is already humongous and sufficiently large, we would only need to search 512 times on average even for such sizes, and therefore the procedure scales well.
