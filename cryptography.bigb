= Symmetric encryption
{parent=Symmetric and public-key cryptography}

Symmetric encryption is a type of <encryption> where you use a password (also known as a "key") to encrypt your data, and then the same password to decrypt the data.

For example, this is the type of encryption that is used for encrypting the data in our <smartphones> and <laptops> with <disk encryption>.

This way, if your laptop gets stolen, the thief is not able to see your private photos without knowing your password, even though they are able to read every byte of your disk.

The downside is that that you have to type your password every time you want to login. This leads people to want to use shorter passwords, which in turn are more prone to <password cracking>.

The other main type of encryption is <public-key cryptography>.

The advantage of <public-key cryptography> is that it allows you to send secret messages to other people even an the attacker is able to capture the encrypted messages. This is for example what you want to do when sending a personal message to a friend over the <Internet>. Such <encryption> is especially crucial when using <wireless communication> such as <Wi-Fi>, where anyone nearby can capture the signals you send and receive, and would be able to read all your data if it weren't encrypted.

Easily sending encrypted messages over the <Internet> is not possible with <symmetric encryption> because for your friend to decrypt the message in that system, you'd need to send them the password, which the attacker would also be able to eavesdrop and then decrypt the message that follows using it. The problem of sharing a password with another person online is called <key exchange>.

<Advanced Encryption Standard> (AES) is one of the most popular families of <symmetric encryption> algorithms.

<OpenSSL> is a popular <open source> implementation of <symmetric and public-key cryptography>. A simple example of using <OpenSSL> for <symmetric encryption> from the <command-line> is:
``
echo 'Hello World!' > message.txt
openssl aes-256-cbc -a -salt -pbkdf2 -in message.txt -out message.txt.enc
``
This asks for a password, which we set as `asdfqwer`, and then produces a file `message.txt.enc` containing garbled text such that:
``
hd message.txt.enc
``
contains:
``
00000000  55 32 46 73 64 47 56 6b  58 31 38 58 48 65 2f 30  |U2FsdGVkX18XHe/0|
00000010  70 56 42 2b 70 45 6c 55  59 38 2b 54 38 7a 4e 34  |pVB+pElUY8+T8zN4|
00000020  4e 37 6d 52 2f 73 6d 4d  62 64 30 3d 0a           |N7mR/smMbd0=.|
0000002d
``
Then to decrypt:
``
openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -pbkdf2 -in message.txt.enc -out message.new.txt
``
once again asks for your password and given the correct password produces a file `message.new.txt` containing the original message:
``
Hello World!
``
This was tested on <Ubuntu 24.04>, OpenSSL 3.0.13. See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16056135/how-to-use-openssl-to-encrypt-decrypt-files[How to use OpenSSL to encrypt/decrypt files? on Stack Overflow].

There is no <provably secure symmetric-key algorithm> besides the <one-time pad>, which has the serious drawback of requiring the key to be as long as the message. This means that we believe that most encryption algorithms are secure because it is a hugely valuable target and no one has managed to crack them yet. But we don't have a mathematical proof that they are actually secure, so they could in theory be broken by new algorithms one day.

There aren't any 2020, except in the trivial <one-time pad> case where the key is as large as the message: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/10815/how-do-we-prove-that-aes-des-etc-are-secure

The only perfect cryptosystem!

The problem is that you need a shared <key (cryptography)> as large as the message.

Systems like <advanced Encryption Standard> allow us to encrypt things larger than the key, but the tradeoff is that they could be possibly broken, as don't have any <provably secure symmetric-key algorithms> as of 2020.

Based on the fact that we don't have a <P (complexity)> algorithm for <integer factorization> as of 2020. But nor proof that one does not exist!

The private key is made of two randomly generated prime numbers: $p$ and $q$. How such large primes are found: <how large primes are found for RSA>.

The public key is made of:
* `n = p*q`
* a randomly chosen integer exponent $e$ between `1` and `e_max = lcm(p -1, q -1)`, where `lcm` is the <Least common multiple>

Given a plaintext message `m`, the encrypted <ciphertext> version is:
``
c = m^e mod n
``
This operation is called <modular exponentiation> can be calculated efficiently with the <Extended Euclidean algorithm>.

The inverse operation of finding the private `m` from the public `c`, `e` and $n$ is however believed to be a hard problem without knowing the factors of `n`.

However, if we know the private `p` and `q`, we can solve the problem. As follows.

First we calculate the <modular multiplicative inverse>. TODO continue.

Answers suggest hat you basically pick a random large odd number, and add 2 to it until your selected <primality test> passes.

The <prime number theorem> tells us that the probability that a number between 1 and $N$ is a prime number is $1/log(N)$.

Therefore, for an N-bit integer, we only have to run the test N times on average to find a prime.

Since say, A 512-bit integer is already humongous and sufficiently large, we would only need to search 512 times on average even for such sizes, and therefore the procedure scales well.

= RSA vs Diffie-Hellman

<RSA (cryptosystem)> vs <Diffie-Hellman key exchange> are the dominant <public-key cryptography> systems as of 2020, so it is natural to ask how they compare:

* https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/797/is-diffie-hellman-mathematically-the-same-as-rsa

As its name indicates, <Diffie-Hellman key exchange> is a <key exchange> algorithm. TODO verify: this means that in order to transmit a message, both parties must first send data to one another to reach a shared secret key. For RSA on the other hand, you can just take the public key of the other party and send encrypted data to them, the receiver does not need to send you any data at any point.

The algorithm is completely analogous to <Diffie-Hellman key exchange> in that you efficiently raise a number to a power $n$ times and send the result over while keeping $n$ as private key.

The only difference is that a different group is used: instead of using the <cyclic group>, we use the <elliptic curve group> of an <elliptic curve over a finite field>.

Authentication is one of the hardest parts of cryptography, because the only truly secure way to do it is by driving to the other party yourself to establish a <pre-shared key> so you can do <message authentication code>.
