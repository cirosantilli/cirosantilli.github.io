The only perfect cryptosystem!

The problem is that you need a shared <key cryptography> as large as the message.

Systems like <advanced encryption standard> allow us to encrypt things larger than the key, but the tradeoff is that they could be possibly broken, as don't have any <provably secure symmetric key algorithms> as of 2020.

Based on the fact that we don't have a <p complexity> algorithm for <integer factorization> as of 2020. But nor proof that one does not exist!

The private key is made of two randomly generated prime numbers: $p$ and $q$. How such large primes are found: <how large primes are found for rsa>.

The public key is made of:
* `n = p*q`
* a randomly chosen integer exponent $e$ between `1` and `e_max = lcm(p -1, q -1)`, where `lcm` is the <least common multiple>

Given a plaintext message `m`, the encrypted cyphertext version is:
``
c = m^e mod n
``
This operation is called <modular exponentiation> can be calculated efficiently with the <extended euclidean algorithm>.

The inverse operation of finding the private `m` from the public `c`, `e` and $n$ is however believed to be a hard problem without knowing the factors of `n`.

However, if we know the private `p` and `q`, we can solve the problem. As follows.

First we calculate the <modular multiplicative inverse>. TODO continue.

Answers suggest hat you basically pick a random large odd number, and add 2 to it until your selected <primality test> passes.

The <prime number theorem> tells us that the probability that a number between 1 and $N$ is a prime number is $1/log(N)$.

Therefore, for an N-bit integer, we only have to run the test N times on average to find a prime.

Since say, A 512-bit integer is already humongous and sufficiently large, we would only need to search 512 times on average even for such sizes, and therefore the procedure scales well.

In the context of cryptography, authentication means "ensuring that the message you got comes from who you think it did".

Authentication is how we prevent the <man in the middle attack>.

Authentication is one of the hardest parts of cryptography, because the only truly secure way to do it is by driving to the other party yourself to establish a <pre shared key> so you can do <message authentication code>. Or to share your <public key> with them if you are satisfied with the safety of <post quantum cryptography>.
